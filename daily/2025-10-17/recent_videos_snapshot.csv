I suggested a place with vegan and meat options. She posted that I'm forcing my carnivore agenda and tried to get me fired. I met Bethany three years ago at a pottery class, where she spent most of the session lecturing everyone about how ceramic glazes contained animal products and we were all complicit in exploitation. She was shaped like a bowling ball, with arms that barely reached around her middle, constantly out of breath from walking upstairs, but somehow convinced that her plant based diet made her morally superior to everyone else in the room. Despite her exhausting personality. I felt sorry for her because she seemed genuinely lonely. She'd moved to our city for a marketing job at a tech startup and didn't know anyone. Everyone deserves at least one friend, so when she asked if I wanted to grab lunch sometime, I said yes, thinking I could handle her quirks if it meant helping someone feel less isolated. Our first lunch together should have been a warning sign about what was coming. I suggested a casual bistro downtown that had both regular and vegan menu options, thinking this would be perfect for accommodating both our preferences. Bethany spent 20 minutes interrogating our server about every ingredient in the vegan pasta, demanding to know if the kitchen used separate pans for cooking meat and whether any animal products touched the surfaces where her food was prepared. The poor server Looked increasingly uncomfortable as Bethany's questions became more aggressive and detailed. She wanted to know about the sourcing of every vegetable that the restaurant's suppliers used, animal fertilizer, and if the cleaning products contained any animal derived ingredients. I apologized to our server twice during this interrogation, mortified by how my new friend was treating someone just trying to do their job. When our food arrived, Bethany photographed her salad from multiple angles while explaining to nearby tables about the environmental benefits of plant based eating. Spoke loudly enough that other diners turned to stare, some rolling their eyes at her impromptu lecture about factory farming. I ate my sandwich quietly, hoping she'd calm down once she started eating, but instead she critiqued my choice.

Obviously, you're not gonna fit when you're like 300 kilos overweight and the seats are designed for average person to fit in. And I'm not hating on the ones that have some plus weight because in some cases it's because they have been ill. But the ones that are obese just because they sit all day and eat and do nothing with it because they consider it my life, my rules or whatever are absolutely pathetic. I mean, sure, your body do what you want, but you can't be seriously coming to TikTok and recording yourself how you don't fit in any average human size chair. Also, I have seen multiple videos that say, by the way, this is healthy body and it was not healthy. Trust me. What's even more embarrassing is when fat people post themselves, the comments are full of sunshine. But when some skinny girl posts herself, the 70% of the comments are filled with hate from some fat bitches that are just jealous saying that they have to eat more cause only their bones are showing. It's seriously disgusting and embarrassing how people can hate out of jealousy while not being in the best form themselves. 1, 2, 3, snake oil out.

My family discovered I was good with kids when I was 14 and babysat my cousin once. That single afternoon of watching cartoons turned me into their unpaid nanny for the next 12 years. At first, it was just by my sister dropping off her toddler just for an hour while she ran errands. That hour turned into six when she decided to get her nails done instead. I. I remember sitting on my floor surrounded by broken crayons and goldfish crackers, realizing I missed my shift at the coffee shop. My brother joined in with midnight text about his twins needing an emergency sitter for his concert plans. College, they took it even further. My sister would bang on my dorm door and dump her kids for entire weekends. She cost me my first serious boyfriend when she called me during our anniversary dinner screaming about a fake emergency. My boyfriend looked at me across that candlelit table and said he couldn't do this anymore. After graduation, my parents made everything worse by secretly giving my siblings keys to my apartment. I started coming home from my marketing job to find kids destroying my kitchen and toys taking over my home office. My boss pulled me aside after I'd missed another presentation and told me to figure out my priorities. The moment they took it too far came three months ago when I woke up to voices in my living room. I stumbled out of my pajamas to find four kids watching cartoons with suitcases next to them. My sister's two kids and my brother's twins were all there eating my cereal like it was just another Saturday. On my counter was a note that made my hand shake. My entire family had booked a month long cruise to Europe and decided not to tell me because I'd make it difficult, the note said. They knew I take good care of the kids like I always do. I kept reading it over and over trying to understand how they could just leave the country without even asking me. My sister had attached a grocery list and my brother left $200 for expenses. I was their personal hired help. They could book without notice. The youngest kid looked up and asked if I was making pancakes for breakfast. That innocent question broke something inside me because these kids had no idea their parents had just abandoned them. That's when I decided to teach them what abandonment really felt like. You see, 12 years of forced babysitting had taught me every rule about child welfare and what authorities look for. I made the kids breakfast and told them we were going to play a game where they told me about all the times they stayed with me before. I recorded videos on my phone as they excitedly shared stories about being dropped off for Days without their parents checking in. The seven year old even mentioned the time his mom left him here when he had strep throat. I carefully documented the suitcases, note and the pathetic $200 meant to last a month. Then I looked up the number for Child Protective Services. My family thought they were getting a free month in Europe. Instead, they were about to learn what happens when you abandon your children with someone who knows the system. I called CPS and reported four abandoned minors with no guardianship papers. The caseworker arrived within two hours and went pale reading the note. By afternoon, the kids were in emergency.

Then I sent her a message, then you won't have a holiday either. I'm Zoe, 29, and I've been the family ATM for years. Single, no kids, decent job in marketing. My sister Brenda has 3 kids and constantly needs help. This year was different. I secretly spent $6,000 on Christmas, rented a cabin, hired a chef, bought personalized gifts for everyone. The worst, I even covered Brenda's December rent without telling her. But let me back up because this goes deeper than just Christmas. For the past three years, I've been Brenda's silent financial savior. When her car broke down in June, I paid the $2,800 repair Bill. When her oldest needed braces, I covered the $4,500 orthodontist fee. When her husband lost his job last spring, I quietly transferred $800 every month to give them a float. I never asked for credit, never posted about it. I just helped because I thought that's what family does. Brenda's friends think she's this amazing mom who has it all figured out. They have no idea. Yeah, her perfect life is funded by her loser single sister who works in marketing. This Christmas was supposed to be my masterpiece. I've been planning since October. The cabin had a stone fireplace, professional decorations and a view of the lake. The chef was making prime rib, lobster, Mac and cheese and homemade desserts. I bought each kid exactly what they'd whispered about wanting, the 300 Dollar art set for Daisy, the gaming headset for Gavin, the American Girl doll for VI. I even hired a photographer to capture their Christmas morning faces. Then last week, Brenda texted, don't come to Christmas anymore. You've been difficult lately. Difficult because I said no when she wanted to take credit for the gifts I bought her kids. She literally asked me to rewrap everything and put her name on the tag so they think the presents came from her, not their aunt. When I said I wanted the kids to know who bought them, she called me selfish and attention seeking. They uninvited me from the Christmas I planned and paid for. The audacity was breathtaking. She thought she could kick me out and still enjoy my 6,000 dollar Christmas like some kind of magical elf had arranged everything. So I went nuclear. I cancelled the cabin reservation, lost the one eye 200 dollar deposit, but worth it. Called the chef, cancelled, ate the 500 dollar cancellation fee. Amazon deliveries all stopped. The photographer cancelled. Then I got creative. I revoked the automatic rent payment that had been saving Brenda's ass for 8 months. I cancelled the grocery delivery I'd scheduled for Christmas Eve, $400 worth of spiral ham, fancy sides and wine. I even called the local toy store and cancelled the layaway items I've been paying on since September. Another $800 in gifts. I texted back then, you won't have a holiday either Christmas Eve five PM, my phone exploded like a bomb went off. First call was Brenda.

I was 18 and technically an adult, but my parents still treated me like I was 12. My mom would go through my backpack every single day when I got home from school, checking my homework like I was in third grade. She'd read my text messages whenever she felt like it. And if I complained, she'd take my phone away for a week. My dad wasn't much better. He had this rule where I couldn't leave the house after six PM even on weekends. If I wanted to hang out with friends, I had to give them a full essay about where I was going, who would be there and when I'd be back. The final straw was when they installed one of those tracking apps on my phone without telling me. I only found out because my friend Jake mentioned seeing my location pop up when he was trying to text me. I confronted them about it that night and my mom just shrugged and said it was for my safety. My dad backed her up, saying as long as I lived under their roof, I followed their rules. Been working at this pizza place since I turned 16, saving up every paycheck except for what I needed for gas and lunch money. By the time I graduated high school, I had almost $4,000 saved up. I started looking at apartments online during my lunch breaks, telling myself I was just browsing. But the More I thought about it, the more I realized I could actually do this. Found this tiny studio apartment about 20 minutes from my job. The rent was only 600 a month and the landlord said if I could prove I had a steady income and pay first month plus deposit, he'd rent to me. I went to look at it on a day my parents thought I was at work. It was small and kind of dingy, but it was mine. I filled out the application that same day. Two weeks later, he called and said I was approved. I could move in the following weekend. That's when it hit me that I was actually doing this. I felt sick to my stomach but also kind of excited. I started slowly moving my stuff out. Every day after work, I'd grab a backpack full of clothes or books and stash them in my car. Told my parents I was staying late to help close the restaurant, which wasn't totally a lie since I was picking up extra shifts to make sure I could afford everything. The hardest part was getting my bigger stuff out. I waited until they went to my aunt's house for Sunday dinner, something I'd gotten out of by saying I had to work. I loaded up my car with my dresser, my desk and my t v, left most of the furniture since it wasn't really mine anyway, but I took the stuff that mattered. I left them a note on the kitchen counter. I kept it simple, told them I'd moved out, that I was safe and that I'd call them in a few days when I was settled. I said I needed space to figure out who I was as an adult and that I hoped they'd understand eventually. I left my house key next to the note. My phone started blowing up around 8 that night, missed calls, texts, voice mails. My mom was crying and half of them my dad was yelling in the others. They wanted to know where I was, if I was okay, why I didn't talk to them first. They said they'd always supported me and couldn't understand why I do this to them. I turned my phone off and didn't turn it back on until the next morning. I had 37 missed calls and way too many texts to read through. I called them back and told them I was fine, gave them my address and said they could come see my place if they wanted. My mom showed up.

Hi, everyone. I'm Sarah Miller and my daughter Tiffany just transferred here today. The chat lit up with a string of welcomes and hellos. Just as I was about to type out my own greeting, a huge block of text appeared. Important notice from Tiffany's mom. Girls in the class, please take note. Starting next week, I'll be posting a picture of what my daughter is wearing each day. Please make sure your child doesn't wear the same thing. Also, I request that everyone please switch to the same brand of laundry detergent we use. My daughter has a very sensitive nose and can't tolerate other scents. Finally, my daughter was a C section baby and is a bit timid. So I ask you to tell your children not to bully her and make sure she's always treated with priority. Wow. I couldn't help but think this isn't just a new student. This is a royal princess who's slumming it with us commoners. Some of the moms in the chat were quick to push back. Karen's mom, are you serious? What my kid wears is none of your business. Why should we have to cater to you? Jessica's mom, exactly. And we're supposed to all use your detergent? My son has allergies, too, and we use specific stuff. Yeah. Who made your kid the queen of the class? My kid is special, too. The chat Quickly devolved into a debate. Usually I just chuckled at the ridiculous things these parents said in the group chat. The class teacher was the administrator and she'd usually step in to calm things down. I didn't see a problem, so I just muted the chat to get some work done. And I got a DM. It was from Alyssa, whose daughter Emily was friends with Lily. Hey, Sarah, you got a.

For as long as I could remember, my younger brother Garrett had been insecure about being weak and scrawny. The LaCrosse team would shove him into lockers daily, calling him Twig Boy. The worst was when he couldn't open a water bottle at lunch and his crush Emily laughed, asking the guy next to her, Garrett's too weak. He needs a man to help him. I always felt bad for him. But the day he discovered one punch man, everything changed. He burst into my room holding his phone showing me Saitama's transformation. Look, he was just like me, a weak, bullied nobody. Then he did the simple training and became the strongest hero alive. I was just happy he found something that gave him hope. The very next morning, Garrett started Saitama's routine religiously, 100 push UPS, 100 sit UPS, 100 squats and a 10 kilometer run every single day. Within two months, his arms showed actual definition and his chest filled out his shirts, the LaCrosse team stopped shoving him around completely. While mom bought him protein powder and dad installed a pull up bar. Look at my dedicated boy. She'd beam at dinner when he shaved his head bald, the school counselor pulled me aside. Whatever is motivating him, it's working. His grades are up, confidence through the roof. Even I was impressed when he bench pressed his body wait for the first time. The best part was Emily starting to notice watching him do pull UPS after school and asking about his anime workout. He flex and quote Sidema, I'm just a guy who's a hero for fun. We all laughed because he was finally becoming the person he wanted to be. But as months passed, things shifted when Garrett demanded everyone call him Sidema. Refusing to Garrett anymore. Teachers got email signed Sidema while he begged mom to legally change his name. When you're 18, she said, this is just a phase. Soon after, he quit soccer because Sidema trained alone and his knuckles stayed permanently stabbed from painting concrete walls in our basement. I'm removing my limiters, he explained, wrapping them in bloody gauze. Now deadlifting 300 pounds, his frame had exploded from 130 to 200 pounds of pure muscle with veins sneaking up his arms like cables. When I tried talking to him about my concerns, he brushed me off. You're getting too intense about this. The whole point is to push past human limits. He showed me his training journal filled with detailed power rankings, strength measurements and notes about breaking through with page after page of Sidema quotes highlighted in yellow. After he passed out doing squats, mom attempted an intervention. Honey, you need rest days. Itama never rested. That's why he transcended. He stormed out to run his 10 kilometer run at midnight. Then the mall incident started a week later when he began picking fights, asking random guys to test His power level until security banned him after the third confrontation. His fist now bore a tattoo reading one punch in bold letters across the knuckles. Six months into his transformation, Garrett looked like a bodybuilder who'd swallowed another bodybuilder. At 220 pounds of carved muscle with shoulders so wide he turned sideways through doorways. We were driving to get groceries on a normal Tuesday morning when he saw a cop conducting a routine traffic stop on the shoulder. Pull over, he said with deadly calm in his voice. What? No, we need to pull over. He grabbed the wheel. This is it, my moment. I pulled over. With shaking hands as he got out and walked toward the officer with purpose. The cop immediately tensed with his hand moving to his whole.

The major's wife grabbed my elbow and steered me past the nice coffee station toward a folding table in the corner where two teenagers sat. She took the ceramic mug from my hand and gave me Styrofoam instead, while her rings dug into my arm. Premium coffee is for senior spouses only. Her eyes went over my ripped jeans and she wrinkled her nose like she smelled something bad. When I opened my mouth to introduce myself, she'd already turned her back to rejoin her group. They leaned in, whispering and looking over their shoulders at me while I stood there holding the cheap cup. My knuckles went white around the Styrofoam as I tried to keep my face calm. The colonel's wife came back and grabbed my orientation packet from the table without asking. She gave me what looked like a kindergarten colouring book with cartoon soldiers and crayons. When deployment came up, she moved her hands like an airplane taking off and said the words really slowly. The major's wife pointed at the wall clock and tilted her head, looking at me, before writing something on her clipboard. Do you even know what branch your husband serves in? She didn't wait for an answer before saying I might be more comfortable with the team dependence next door. Someone else offered me a juice box like I was a little kid at snack Time! My face burned hot, but I kept my expression blank while counting backwards from 10. Before I could respond about the teen group, the major's wife grabbed my hand and tried pulling off my ring to check for inscriptions. Someone actually lifted my shirt looking at my stomach while checking ovulation dates on their phone. The colonel's wife pulled up military dating sites showing me where husbands go when wives get fat. Another started a group chat adding my photo with gold digger alert while they talked about which base brothel soldiers went to overseas. This one definitely poked holes in the condoms. They passed my wedding ring around like evidence while arguing if it was fake or stolen. My jaw hurt from clenching so hard I thought my teeth might crack. Gold digger comment made them all go crazy. They made me stand in the center while they listed every military benefit I was stealing from taxpayers. The major's wife grabbed my phone, scrolling through apps looking for tinder while others said I hung around base bars looking for drunk soldiers to trap. Someone started taking photos of my face for their benefits editor warning page on Facebook. The colonel's wife pushed my phone back at me and leaned in close enough that I could smell her coffee breath mixed with expensive perfume. Which corner did he find you on? Won by the enlisted club. My legs shook as they circled me like they were waiting to attack The room felt smaller every second. The corner comment made them go completely nuts. They backed me against the wall while the major's wife said I was the type who around during deployments. Multiple hands grabbed at my phone, forcing my thumb onto the screen as they went through work emails, yelling about male names. The colonel's wife's nails dug into my cheeks, leaving marks while she made me look at her. Every deployment is your hunting season. They had me stuck there arguing about which base brothels I probably worked at while calling numbers from my contacts. Someone started calling my husband's unit to report cheating. When the door slammed open and secure, he came running in. My vision went fuzzy while every muscle in my body wanted to fight back. The security sergeant stopped dead in the doorway, looking at what was happening. Colonel Silva? The wives still had me stuck against the wall with their hands on me. You know this fraud? That's our K9 commander. She commands the entire working dog unit. The base commander came in behind him looking stressed about something. Where's Colonel Silva? The Pentagon's been.

When I was 12 years old, my mother slit her wrists in front of me because I asked to go to a friend's birthday party. And as she bled into our kitchen sink, she made me promise I'd never try to leave her again. She survived that time, barely. While the paramedics worked on her, she gripped my hand with bloody fingers and whispered, this is what happens when you abandon me. I spent three days in the hospital chapel, 13 years old and convinced I'd almost murdered my mother by wanting to go to a sleepover. When she came home, arm bandaged and eyes hollow, she made let me sleep in her bed so she could hold on to me all night. I need to know you're here, she said. Otherwise, the darkness comes back. The rules formed quickly after that. I couldn't join clubs because staying late at school feels like you're choosing them over me. I couldn't have friends over because their energy disrupts our bond. Each boundary came with the same threat, sometimes spoken, sometimes just a gesture toward her scarred wrists. She kept razors displayed on the bathroom counter like weapons, reminding me what would happen if I broke her heart again. By 14, I was homeschooled and complete. Completely isolated. Mom said it was better this way. Just us two against a world that didn't understand our connection. She'd have good days where she'd braid my Hair. And we'd watch movies. And I think maybe this was enough. But then I'd mention wanting to learn to drive someday, and she'd go silent. She'd lock herself in the bathroom, and I'd sit outside the door, begging her to come out. She'd emerge hours later, showing me fresh cuts on her thighs. Practice cuts, she'd call them. For when you finally abandoned me for real. I attempted my first real escape at 15. I found a youth shelter address at the library and memorized it. One night while mom slept, I packed a bag and made it to the front door. But she was sitting in the dark living room, waiting. I felt you pulling away, she said calmly. Then she swallowed an entire bottle of sleeping pills in front of me. I called 9 1 1 and rode with her to the hospital, holding her hand while they pumped her stomach. When she woke up, she smiled sadly. You did this, she said. But at least you stayed to watch. After that, she installed bells on my bedroom door and windows. She test me randomly, pretending to hurt herself to see if I try to leave or just save her. I always chose to save her. But I was dying inside, suffocating under the weight of keeping her alive. I started writing goodbye letters I never send, hiding them in my textbooks. I. I tried to get away again when I was 16. Mom had fallen asleep. After taking anxiety medication, and I thought I had time, I made it three blocks before a police car pulled up. Mom had called them claiming I was mentally unstable. She'd shown them my hidden letters as evidence. As they drove me home, she texted me, if you'd kept going, you would have found my body when you came back. I had the bath ready that night. She showed me a new scar on her stomach. I did this while you were gone, she said. She made me help her bandage it, narrating how she would have cut deeper if I made it another block. Next time you leave, she promised, I'll make sure I time it perfectly. You'll be free, but you'll be a murderer. I became hyper vigilant, watching for signs she was spiraling. My entire existence became keeping her from the edge. When I caught her standing on our apartment balcony at 3:00am, I didn't ask why. I just took her hand and let her back to bed. But then I got a scholarship to art school. Mom found the acceptance letter before I could hide it. She didn't say anything, just disappeared into the bathroom. I heard water running and pounded on the door. When she finally

I hated the idea of my 17 year old daughter dating anyone. But when she brought home this boy named Pete, I lost it. He had a motorcycle, tattoos and that smug smile that made me wanna run his name through the system. I made it my mission to break them up. I'd randomly show up at places they hung out, flash my badge around and remind Pete that I knew how to make bodies disappear. But this kid never flinched. He just smile and say, have a good day, sir. When he came for dinner the first time, I placed my gun on the table next to my plate. My wife kicked me under the table but I didn't care. Pete just looked at it and said, Nice Glock 19, sir. My uncle's got the same one at his security firm. That's when the real torture began. I started making him come over every weekend to bond. I'd have him help me with the most backbreaking chores I could think of, reshingling the roof in July, digging out a tree stump by hand, moving every piece of furniture in the house to steam clean the carpets. This kid never complained. He'd show up at 7:00am sharp already wearing work clothes, even brought his own work gloves. When I try to wear him down with endless tasks, he just say, what's next, sir? One Saturday, I had him helping me rebuild the deck. I was being extra harsh, making him redo boards that were perfectly fine. Around noon, my daughter brought us water. As she walked away, I caught Pete watching her. But it wasn't the way most teenage boys looked at girls. He had this soft smile like he was watching something precious. I decided to test him. You know she's way out of your league, right? He wiped his forehead and said, oh, I know, sir. Trust me. I know. That's why I'm here every weekend, letting you test me, because she's worth it. I was about to respond when we heard screaming from inside the house. We both ran in to find my wife on the kitchen floor. She'd.

In my family, we had something called Health Day. Every Saturday morning at 9:00am sharp, we'd finish breakfast and dad would already have the basement ready with his white coat on and all his medical equipment laid out on metal trays in the basement. Our mom would kiss our foreheads before sending us down one by one. Then came the examinations. Thorough inspections of every inch of our bodies while he muttered medical terms and scribbled in thick blue binders. He'd make us stand naked under the bright lights while he circled us slowly, his gloved fingers pressing into our skin, checking what he called abnormalities. He called it preventative care. I dreaded it. Every single week. The rule was you couldn't flinch or complain or you'd start over from the beginning. The strangest part? We weren't allowed to mention health day at school. Not to teachers, not to friends. I only realised in middle school how weird that was. How other kids just went to pediatricians once a year, not secret basement clinics every week. But the worst part was the special examinations. If dad found something concerning during the regular check, you'd get called down. On week nights, he had this small locked room with bright lights and an exam table with stirrups. The metal was always cold and he'd spend what felt like hours with his instruments, documenting every detail while telling us to relax and breathe. He said it Was for comprehensive assessment. As a kid, I was terrified. I'd count the ceiling tiles over and over. But dad said fear meant you were taking your health seriously. When I got older, I started questioning everything. Why did we need weekly exams when no one else did? Why did mom drink before every health day? I remember once, at 14, I asked if I could skip it for Rachel's sleepover. Dad gripped my wrist and stared at me with these desperate eyes. Health Day is the only thing keeping you safe, he said. That's when I knew something was deeply wrong. Rachel's family had annual checkups, vaccination schedules, growth charts on the fridge. No basement procedures, no locked rooms, no binders documenting their bodies. Just normal healthcare. I finally refused to go downstairs when I turned 16. Dad went ballistic, screaming that I was ungrateful and didn't understand the dangers. Mom just stood there shaking. He locked me in my room and said I couldn't leave until I submitted to a full examination the next morning. Mom slipped me $20 under the door and whispered to use the window. When I came back that night, dad acted like nothing had happened. He just asked if I was ready for my examination, like he hadn't imprisoned me the night before. That's when I started planning. The whole thing ate at me. Why was dad so obsessed with our health when he wasn't even a doctor? Where did he get all That equipment. Three months later, I told my health teacher everything. Patterson kept her face very still as I explained our Saturday routine. She said she needed to make a phone call. I knew what that meant. She came back with the principal. Then the police came. Then child services. They took us out of class one by one. Just like health day. Except this time, we didn't go home. I'll never forget Dad's face when they arrested him. Not angry, just broken. I was protecting them, he kept saying. The officers found the binders. Dozens

I'm sitting at my reserved table at this fancy Italian place when a couple walks up and says, excuse me, you're at our table. I politely tell them I have a seven PM reservation under my name. The woman rolls her eyes and says as well. We have one too, and we were here first. I show them my confirmation email. The guy gets aggressive, look, we eat here every week. The hostess knows us. You need to move. The woman adds, we tip really well here. They know to take care of us. I refuse and say, I'm not moving for my confirmed reservation. The guy starts raising his voice, this is ridiculous. We're regulars. Other diners start looking over. The woman notices, and it's louder. Can you believe this? Some people have no courtesy. I flag down our waitress, hoping she'll check the reservation system. She walks over looking nervous. The couple immediately pounces, thank god you're here. This person took our usual table. The waitress looks between us awkwardly, oh, there might have been a mix up. Maybe you could sit at the bar. The couple Smurfs like they've won. The woman crosses her arms. See? Even she knows this is our table. The guy adds, we've been coming here for three years, same table every Friday. I'm getting heated, but stay calm and ask the waitress to check her system. He hesitates and says, well, they Are very good customers. The woman jumps in. Exactly. We spend serious money here, not like some random walk in. I tell her I'm not a walk in and show my confirmation again. The guy dismisses it. Anyone can fake an email these days. The woman suggests, why don't you just go somewhere else? There are plenty of other restaurants. Other customers are now openly staring at the scene. One couple at the next table starts whispering. The waitress looks uncomfortable and suggests again, the bar has really nice seating, same menu. The guy nods, approving. Perfect solution. Everyone's happy. I refuse to budge and ask to speak to the manager. The woman laughs. Oh please, he knows us personally. The guy adds, we had dinner with him last month. Good luck with that. The waitress says the manager is busy in the kitchen. The couple exchanges knowing looks. The woman leans in. Look, we can make this easy or hard. Your choice. I ask what that means. The guy explains, we know the owner. One word from us and you'll never get a table here again. I stand my ground and say I'm keeping my legally reserved table. The couple gets more aggressive. The woman starts talking to nearby tables. You believe? Some people. No respect for loyalty. The guy joins. In three years we've been coming here. This is what customer service has become. A man at another table nods sympathetically. The woman turns back to me. Last Chance. Move, or we'll make sure everyone knows how selfish you are. That's when I pull out my phone and call the restaurant. Right there in front of everyone. Hi, this is Johnny. I made a reservation for seven PM under Johnson. There's some confusion about my table. The couples come. Confidence wavers slightly. The guy whispers, what is he doing? The hostess who seated the couple answers. I put it on speaker so everyone can hear. Oh, Mister Johnson.

I pretended to be my cousin, the substitute teacher for a day and accidentally got my dream job. I was 19, broke as hell and still waiting to hear back from community college. My cousin Tyler was a substitute teacher who sometimes paid me to drive him around since his car was trash. One Tuesday morning he calls me freaking out, dude, I just rear ended someone. I'm supposed to be at Westbrook Middle School in 20 minutes. If I miss another day, they'll cut me from their sub list. I was eating cereal in my pajamas. That sucks, man. Wait, he said, you still have my school I d from when you helped me move those boxes last month? Yeah. Why? I'm serious. Let's go. Pretend to be me. Take attendance. Keep them quiet. It's just study hall. I laughed. You're insane. Please. They won't even check. Most subs just sit there anyway. It's one period. Something about the desperation in his voice got to me, plus I needed money. I threw on Tyler's spare button down shirt that was way too big and drove to the school with his laminated badge. The front desk lady barely looked up. You must be the sub for Miss Peterson's class, room 2, 13. Here's your clipboard. I walked down that hallway trying to look confident while my heart was pounding. The kids were loud but not crazy. I took attendance, reading names. Off the roster. When they asked where their teacher was, I said she had a family emergency and today was independent study. Can we work on homework, this girl asked. Absolutely, I said, having no clue what else to tell them. For an hour, I just walked around pretending to supervise while they did whatever. Some kid asked me about math and I said I'd get back to him. Another wanted to use the bathroom and I let like five kids go because I didn't know the rules. The bell rang and a whole new group of kids walked in. Nobody had told me there were multiple periods. I panicked but tried to play it cool. Same routine, independent study day. The projector wasn't working, so sorry, no video today. I made them read silently and told them I'd be grading papers instead. I just stared at Tyler's lesson plan book trying to figure out what I was supposed to be doing. Third period came, then fourth. I was making it up as I went. When kids got too loud, I'd say stuff like, remember, this affects your participation grade, even though I had no idea how grading worked. During lunch, I hid in an empty classroom and texted Tyler updates. He kept saying, you're doing great, just get through the day. Fifth period, this kid asked me about the Revolutionary War assignment. I panicked and said, what do you think the most important battle was? Then I made them Debate it while I googled stuff on my phone under the desk. By 6th period, I was actually getting comfortable. These kids weren't that different from my little brother and his friends. I started a trivia game about random stuff and they were actually into it. Then the assistant principal walked in my

My cousin Ellen texted me last night at 11 p m. The kids are so excited to be vampires at your party tomorrow. I nearly dropped my phone. I never invited her kids. Not after what happened last year. For context, I've hosted an elaborate Halloween party for the past five years. It's my. I think I spent months planning the decorations, curating the perfect playlist, and mixing signature cocktails. My friends look forward to it all year. Last October, Ellen called me crying because her babysitter canceled last minute. Please, I haven't been out in months. But twins will behave, I promise. They're better now. Against my better judgment, I said yes. I mean, how bad could a couple of seven year olds be? Catastrophic. As it turns out, within 20 minutes of arriving, they were running laps around my apartment. Ellen just sipped her drink and chatted, completely oblivious. The first disaster happened when they decided to play hot lava and jumped from my couch to my antique coffee table. The table, a 2 hundred year old family heirloom my grandmother left me, collapsed under their weight. Ellen barely looked up. Kids will be kids. He shrugged. An hour later, I found them in my bedroom dumping out my makeup collection onto my white bedspread. We're doing monster makeup, they announced, proudly, covered in my fifty dollar foundation. While I was Cleaning up the makeup disaster, they somehow got into the Halloween candy I had set aside for trick or treaters. They not only devoured most of it, but also fed several chocolate bars to my dog, pepper. By midnight, pepper was violently ill. I had to leave my own party to rush her to the emergency vet. The Bill? $600. When I returned home at 3:00am, exhausted and worried about pepper, I discovered one of the twins had gotten sick and vomited directly into my fish tank. Surprise Betta fish, the one I'd raised from a tiny fry, was floating at the top the next morning. Ellen's response to all this destruction. They were over tired.

She seemed fine with it at the time. Yet here we were the night before my party and she'd forgotten that crucial detail. I typed back, sorry, Ellen, no kids allowed. Remember what happened last year? My apartment still hasn't recovered. Her response appeared instantly. They were just being children. Besides, I already bought their costumes and told them they're going to Aunt Katie's spooky party. You wouldn't disappoint kids on Halloween, would you? That's just cruel. Actually, I would. And I wasn't about to let emotional manipulation ruin another Halloween. Instead of arguing further, I had a better idea. My neighbour, Mike, works as a professional clown for children's parties. But here's the thing about Mike. He's 6 4, covered in tattoos and has this naturally intense stare. Kids are terrified of him. Despite his best efforts to be friendly, I called Mike and explained my situation. He laughed and agreed to help for $200 and unlimited access to my Halloween punch. Next evening, as my adult guests began arriving, Mike took up his position on my front porch. He wore his standard clown costume but with blood splatters added to his white makeup and carried a sign that read, adults only party. Children will be entertained by me on the porch. At exactly seven thirty PM, Ellen's minivan pulled into my driveway. I watched through the window as she parked and started unloading her vampire twins. Then she spotted Mike sitting eerily still on my Porch swing, slowly twisting a balloon animal while staring directly at her car. The look on her face was priceless. She frantically rolled up the car windows and locked the doors. The twins were pressing their faces against the glass, their vampire makeup now streaked with tears. Ellen reversed so quickly she knocked over my mailbox in her escape. My phone lit up with a furious text. What kind of sick joke is this? I simply replied, adults only means adults only. Enjoy your evening. The party was perfect. No broken heirlooms, no emergency vet visits and not a single fish was harmed. Mike turned out to be the hit of the party. He makes incredible balloon martini glasses. Ellen hasn't spoken to me since, but several family members have thanked me privately. Apparently, I'm not the first victim of her. Kids will be kids parenting style.

So. My girlfriend's ex died in a car crash, like, three years before we started dating. She told me about it pretty early on, and honestly, I felt bad for her. That's a lot to go through. She said she was over it, but still stayed close with his parents because they were like family to her. I get it. Grief is weird, and people handle it different ways. About four months into US dating, she asked if I wanted to meet them. I'm not gonna lie. I thought it was gonna be super awkward. Like, what do you even say in that situation? But she kept saying how important they were to her and how they'd love to meet me, so I agreed. Figured I'd just show up, be polite, shake some hands, and that'd be that. First visit was fine at first. His mom was nice. Made cookies, asked me normal questions, like where I went to school and what my family was like. Then his dad started talking. He was going on and on about his son, which I expected. But then he turned to me and asked what I did for work. I told him I'm an accountant. He looked at my hands, then looked back up at me and said, yeah, I could tell. Well, your hands haven't seen any real work. Then he laughed like it was a Joke. I just kind of smiled and didn't say anything, because what are you supposed to say to that? My girlfriend didn't seem to notice or care. On the drive home, I mentioned it, and she said he was probably just trying to be funny and that I shouldn't take it so seriously. But it kept happening every single time we went over there, which ended up being, like, once every two weeks. Find some way to compare me to his son. One time, he was showing me pictures of his son working on this old truck in their driveway. He said, now that's a real man right there. Someone who knows how to use his hands. And he looked at me and said, I bet you've never even changed your own oil, have you? I hadn't, but I also don't even own a car. I live in the city and take the train to work. I told him that, and he just shook his head like I said something disappointing. Another time, we were all sitting in the living room, and he started talking about how his son used to play football in high school. Full contact, tough as nails, all that stuff. Then he asked me if I played any sports. I told him I ran cross country. He literally laughed and said, cross

From across the rooftop, I noticed Josh finally looking in my direction, and his expression changed when he saw Ruby's hand on my forearm. Ruby noticed him staring and leaned in closer to whisper loud enough for nearby people to hear. You know what, gorgeous? I'm here with some friends, but I'd much rather spend the evening getting to know know you better. She pulled out her phone and handed it to me with a contact screen already open. Put your number in and I'll text you about this wine bar I know that makes yours look like amateur hour. She paused and studied my face for a moment before adding softly, unless you have birthday plans already. I felt my throat tighten because of course, she figured it out somehow, while the man I lived with had forgotten completely. How did you know? I asked, and she smiled gently. Lucky guess. But also, you've been checking your phone like you're waiting for something, and that dress screams special occasion. Josh appeared at my side so fast he nearly knocked over someone's drink, and his arm went around my waist for the first time all evening. Hey, babe, I've been looking everywhere for you, he said, even though we both knew that was a lie and his eyes kept darting between Ruby and me. Who's your friend? Ruby smiled like she'd been expecting this exact reaction and extended her Hand to shake his. Ruby and I was just telling your girlfriend how stunning she looks tonight, since apparently someone forgot to mention it. She tilted her head and her smile turned sharper. I was also wishing her a happy birthday, since that seems to have been forgotten, too. The color drained from Josh's face as he stared at me, and I can see the moment it hit him what day it was. The silence that followed was deafening, and Josh's arm tightened around me as he finally looked at my dress like he was seeing it for the first time. Of course she looks beautiful. She always does, he said, but the words felt hollow after two years of nothing. Ruby raised an eyebrow and looked directly at me when she responded, does she now? Because from what I gathered, she didn't even know that. Josh practically dragged me away after that, making excuses about needing to say happy birthday to his coworker. But the day damage was done. The car ride home was 20 minutes of him suddenly noticing everything about my appearance, from my hair to my shoes to the perfume I've been wearing for six months while desperately trying to make birthday plans at 11 at night. I can't believe that woman was hitting on you right in front of everyone on your birthday, he finally said. I turned to look at him. She had known me for just 30 minutes, and I didn't even have To tell her it was my birthday. The silence was deafening

He suddenly remembered how to speak. My boyfriend Josh dragged me to his co worker's birthday party at some upscale rooftop bar downtown even though I told him I had nothing to wear. After spending two hours getting ready and dropping $80 on a new dress that hugged every curve just right, I walked out to the living room where he was scrolling through his phone. He glanced up for maybe half a second before looking back down and saying we should leave or we hit traffic. The entire car ride he talked about his fantasy football line up while I sat there feeling like I'd wasted my time trying to look nice for once. I kept waiting for him to say something about the night or acknowledge what today was, but he just kept talking, talking about quarterback injuries and trade deadlines. The rooftop was packed with his work friends who I'd met maybe twice before and Josh immediately abandoned me to go debate forts with the guys by the bar. I found myself standing alone near the railing pretending to be fascinated by the city skyline while couples around me took selfies and his co workers gave me the polite nods before moving on. 20 minutes passed with him not even checking if I needed a drink. That dress is absolutely killer on you. Set a voice beside me and I Turned to find a woman with intricate tattoos covering both arms and the kind of confidence that made everyone else fade into background noise. She had that alternative style that made my simple black dress feel boring by comparison. But her eyes were genuine when she continued, seriously, the way it shows off your shoulders and that neckline is chef's kiss perfection. I felt my face heat up because honestly, I couldn't remember the last time anyone had complimented my appearance, including the man I've been dating for two years. Your boyfriend is an idiot if he didn't tell you that already, I said after I thanked her. And she must have seen something in my expression because she shook her head knowingly. Let me guess he didn't even notice when you walked out looking like that. I tried to laugh it off, but she wasn't having it. they have no idea what they have until someone else points it out, do they? She extended her hand with black nail polish that somehow looked elegant instead of edgy. I'm Ruby and I'm buying you a drink because someone who looks that good shouldn't be standing here alone. We talked for the next half hour and she made me feel like the most interesting person at that party. She asked about my job, my hobbies, my opinion on everything from movies to politics. I maintained eye contact the entire time and kept finding excuses to touch my arm when She laughed at my jokes. You're funny, too, she said, after I made some sarcastic comment about Robert. Parties, beautiful fun.

The coach said no phones during class. While I begged the secretary to call 9 1 1 from the parking lot. I was reviewing quarterly reports at my desk when my phone buzzed with a text from my 16 year old son Lucas. Dad, something's really wrong with my heart. It's beating super fast and I can't catch my breath. I'm in P E right now and Coach Brennan won't let me sit down. The words hit me like ice water in my veins. Lucas had been born with a complex congenital heart defect that required open heart surgery when he was 4 years old. We'd spent years managing his condition with regular cardiology appointments and strict activity restrictions. I'd sent detailed medical documentation to Lincoln High at the beginning of the school year. Lucas's cardiologist, Doctor Angela Moss, had written explicit instructions about recognizing the warning signs of cardiac distress. Rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness or fatigue during exercise were red flags requiring immediate intervention. I met personally with Coach Brennan, the school nurse and Principal Davies to review Lucas's condition and emergency protocols. They'd all nodded and assured me they understood the seriousness. My hands shook as I tried calling Lucas immediately, but the call went straight to voicemail. Pe classes had a strict no phone policy and students had to leave their devices in lockers during the period. I grabbed my keys and sprinted Through the office while dialing the school's main number. The phone rang six times before the secretary answered with her usual monotone voice. Lincoln High School, this is Donna speaking. How may I help you? I told her this was Michael Martinez and I had a medical emergency involving my son Lucas. In P E. Class, I explained Lucas's heart condition. While running to my car in the parking lot, he's texting me that he can't breathe and his heart is racing. This is exactly what his cardiologist warned us about. Someone needs to get to that gymnasium right now and check on him. Donna put me on hold without saying anything while I fumbled with my car keys. The whole music played for what felt like an eternity, some generic instrumental version of a song I couldn't identify. I was already backing out of my parking space when she he finally came back on the line. Donna said she'd spoken with Coach Brennan, who reported that all students were participating normally in PE activities. Lucas was running laps with his classmates and showed no signs of distress. She suggested that teenagers off.

My ex boyfriend, Jake, and I broke up two years ago, but we stayed friends. He was dating this girl, Emma, who seemed nice enough, and when their wedding invitation came in the mail, I honestly felt happy for them. The invitation said cocktail attire, and I had this gorgeous white dress that I bought for my cousin's rehearsal dinner but never got to wear. Here's the thing, though. It wasn't wedding dress white. It was more like cream colored with tiny silver dots all over it. I paired it with a navy blazer and navy shoes. I thought I looked appropriate and classy. My roommate even said I looked great when I left that morning, I got to the church about 15 minutes before the ceremony started. The. The moment I walked in, I felt every single person's eyes on me. The ushers kind of froze when they saw me, and this older woman in the front row actually gasped out loud. I started to panic, but figured maybe I was just imagining things. Then Jake's mom spotted me. She marched over in her purple mother of the groom dress, grabbed my arm, and whispered, what on earth were you thinking? I was so confused. I asked her what she meant, and she just stared at my dress like I had shown up naked. That's when it hit me. White dress wedding. Oh, no. I Tried to explain that it was cream, not white, and I had a blazer, but she wasn't having it. She told me I needed to leave immediately or she'd have security escort me out. I was mortified. But then Jake appeared from the back room where he was getting ready. He saw the commotion and came over. His mom started explaining the situation to him, pointing at my dress like it was evidence in a crime scene. Jake looked at me, then at his mom, then back at me. I expected him to be angry or embarrassed. Instead, he started laughing. Not mean laughing, but genuine can't help it laughing. He said, mom

Like, yeah, I want the little curly hair and chubby cheeks combo. Maybe give them my sarcasm and someone else's math skills because I've been failing since birth. I don't wanna do the freaky either. Like why is that step even required? Why do I have to risk my soul insanity in a sweaty emotional situation just to unlock the baby starter pack? The fact people would know I did too. And the way people say, but it's all worth it in the end. Like, girl, that's what they say after surviving a car crash. You're not convincing me to grow a human like it's a houseplant when I literally forget to feed myself some days. I'm not stable enough to be a life factory. And why is no one talking about the fact that you don't even get a break after the baby's born? Like now you get to wake up every 2 hours and get screamed at by a bald roommate with anger issues. I just want the baby. I want to dress them like a minion and send them to preschool with a juice box. But I want to skip the pregnancy part, skip the pain, skip the loading screen, give Me the kid, just spawn them in.

So I made her watch him fall for me instead. My younger sister, Mia, has been using the same excuse since she turned 21. She can't have her one true love so she's entitled to destroy everyone else's. And I don't mean that in the cute she still hung up on her ex kind of way. I mean it like if you're happy, she'll find a way to make you miserable. Then blame it on her tragic love story, the one true love, some guy named Ethan she met at a college party four years ago. They hooked up once. He never called. And somehow that became her origin story for being a piece of shit. It started with her best friend since kindergarten, Jess. One weekend, Mia stayed over at Jess's place and by Monday, Jess's boyfriend was sending Mia good morning texts. When Jess found them together in her own bed, Mia actually said, you don't understand what it's like to lose your soulmate. Jess never spoke to her again. Then came our cousin's engagement party. Mia showed up in a dress that cost more than my rent, got wine drunk and cornered the groom in the bathroom. Exact words later, she kept saying I reminded her of someone special. Thank god he pushed her off and told his fiance immediately. But Mia, she cried to our parents about how seeing happy couples triggered her. Trauma. Mom bought her a spa weekend to help her heal. By the time I met Ryan, I knew the drill. I kept him away from family dinners, deleted Mia from my social media and told him my sister was going through something and needed space. Two years it worked. We got engaged last spring. Small ceremony planned, nothing fancy, just us and close friends. I made one mistake though. I mentioned it at Mom's birthday dinner. Mia's eyes lit up like Christmas came early. I'm so happy for you, she said while hugging me. When do I get to meet him? A week later, Ryan showed me his phone laughing. Your sister found me on Instagram with some fake account. Look at these messages. We read them together, mocking her desperation and then he promised to block her. Well, three weeks before my wedding, I had the flu. Ryan was supposed to be at his brother's golf tournament for the day. But my friend lived near Mia's apartment complex and texted me to come over since I was already at my sister's. What she said she'd seen Ryan's Tesla in the visitor spot. My chest went cold. I drove over, fever and all and use the spare key Mia had given me for emergencies. I found them on her couch, her head in his lap, his hand in her hair, both half dressed. She looked up at me with those fake tears already forming. I'm so sorry, she whispered. He just reminds me so much of Ethan and I stormed out. He didn't even try to save what we had. That's when I decided she'd learn what losing really feels like. See, Ethan wasn't some mystery man who just vanished. We'd actually been following each other on Instagram for three years. We had mutual friends from college, the occasional like on each other's posts, never really talked. He lived three hours away, worked as a physical therapist and posted videos of his golden retriever. So I slid into his DMS with a simple message, hey, this is weird, but my sister had a thing for you in college and just ruined my wedding. Want to help me ruin her life? He responded in 12 minutes, Mia, the girl who showed up at my mom's house and then turns out she'd driven to his hometown, introduced herself to his mother as his girlfriend and tried to convince the poor woman she was going to be her daughter in law. And that's when he'd filed a restraining order that she apparently ignored. We texted back and forth for a few days sharing our Mia horror stories until he suggested.

I discovered my wife was cheating when the kids mentioned Uncle Steve. Have been helping mommy feel better at night. The betrayal hurt worse than anything I'd ever felt, but I knew staying would destroy me, so I filed for divorce. During the proceedings, I practically begged her to be reasonable about custody. She looked me in the eyes and said, I would never keep your children from you for six months. She actually kept her word, and we fell into this decent routine where we'd exchange the kids every Friday without any drama. She'd even text me little updates about their school days, and we managed to sit together at their soccer games like normal divorced parents. But then I pulled up for my regular Friday pickup, and there was a for sale sign in the yard, and the house was completely empty. I actually fell to my knees on their lawn because I knew she'd done it. She'd actually taken my kids. I called her phone over and over, but it just rang. When I gave up, I noticed the notification for a voicemail that came at 6:00am. Her voice was casual, saying, we've relocated to Seattle for Steve's job, and the kids are already enrolled in school. Like she was telling me about changing their soccer practice time. I sat in that driveway for an hour, dissociating, because she'd been planning on moving 3,000 miles. Away for months while looking me in the eye every Friday. The next morning, a process server handed me court papers claiming I was an absent father who prioritized work over my children. And I realized she'd also been documenting my business trips, kept calling and texting, begging to just hear my kids voices. It actually took three days for me to get through to her. She answered, and instead of explaining anything, she offered monthly video calls like she was being generous.

My sister in law Kelly had her first miscarriage about six months ago. It was devastating. I get that. The whole family rallied around her and my brother Jake, bringing casseroles and giving them space to grieve. But then she started acting like she was the only person who'd ever lost a baby. It started small. At family dinners, she'd make comments about how nobody understood what real loss felt like. When my cousin Amanda talked about her dog dying, Kelly rolled her eyes and said that's not the same thing at all. When my mom mentioned missing my grandpa who died last year, Kelly literally scoffed and said, you got to say goodbye to him. Though the worst part was how she treated me. I've been married to my husband Chris for 8 years and we don't have kids yet. Kelly started making these passive aggressive comments about how lucky I was to not have to worry about these things, how I couldn't possibly understand what she was going through. Last weekend was my nephew's birthday party. Kelly seemed okay during most of it, playing with the kids and laughing at their jokes. But then my brother's friend brought up how his wife was pregnant and Kelly's whole mood shifted. She got quiet and started picking out her food. Later when we were in the kitchen cleaning up, Kelly started talking. About how hard it was seeing pregnant women everywhere. I tried to be supportive, telling her I understood how triggering that must be. That's when she snapped. No, you don't understand, she said, her voice getting louder. You have no idea what it's like to lose a baby. You've never even been pregnant. You don't know what real loss feels like. Something inside me just broke. I've been holding this in for years, keeping it private because Chris and I decided we didn't want the.

Every Thursday for three years, I told my wife Becca the same thing. I'm going to hang with the boys tonight, be back around midnight. Truth is, I was driving to the cinema to watch movies alone because I just needed some me time. But then two months ago, my movie ended abruptly and I came home two hours earlier than planned. When I I turned onto our street, there was a black infinity in our driveway. My heart stopped as I watched back all the footage from our doorbell camera and saw a man getting out of the car and walking up like he'd done it before. Becca opened. Before he could ring, they kissed the kind where her hand went to his neck. My stomach dropped. I wanted to burst through that door and confront them, but I decided on the spot that that would be too. I needed to do something else, something that would destroy her. So I drove around until 12:30 and walked in with a story about Tony getting drunk. Becca was showering. Hey, babe, how was your night? Good. You know how it is. The next two Thursdays I kept my routine but park down the street at 8:30 to watch. At the same time, the same car pulled up. I zoomed in on the ring footage and that's when it hit me. The man was Mark. Mark who supposedly moved to Seattle two years Ago my knees were shaking, but I took screenshots and sent them to my lawyer to further build my case. When I was confident enough that I had everything basically set up, I dropped the bomb. Becca was going on about her fake plans for when I left for boys night when I randomly blurted out, you know who I miss? Mark. That guy and I used to have so much fun before he moved to Seattle. Her fork stopped halfway to her mouth just for a second. Mark was great. You guys still text though, right? Sometimes. The next morning she woke up different with this nervous energy. She made some phone calls behind closed doors. And since it was Thursday during lunch, she texted, what time are you heading out tonight? She never asked before, so I knew the comment about Mark got her. Probably 7:30. Why? Just wondering. The guys doing anything special? Same old after work. She was cooking in full makeup. You look nice, I said. Just felt like making an effort for you to come home to. But she kept checking her phone and setting it down, then picking it back up at 7:15. She practically pushed me out. Don't want you to be late. Tell everyone I say hi. I drove to my regular spot down the street where I watched them, but this time there was no car that showed up. And at nine fifteen, becca's own car pulled out. I followed her. First stop, o'malley's sports bar, where she thought i'd be. She walked in confidently, then came out five minutes later looking confused, taking her phone, scanning the parking lot. Then she got back in her car. Her second stop, the dugout, another sports bar. Through the windows, I watched her walk the entire place, moving table to table, even checking the bathroom entrance area. She showed her phone to a waitress who shrugged. Back to the car, more frantic phone checking. Third stop, Buffalo Wild Wings. She stayed longer, this time, 15 minutes. I could see her at the bar talking to the manager, showing him something on her phone, probably my picture. He shook his head, pointed to their mostly empty tables. Thursday wasn't exactly prime sports bar night. Fourth stop, the dive bar where Tony actually used to drag us. She went straight to the bartender. I slipped in through the side door, ducked into the hallway by the bathrooms, heard her say every.

What makes you special? When I was 11, I started noticing this weird thing. Whenever someone lied to me, my tongue would tingle like when you lick a battery. The first time it happened was at school when my friend Mia said she didn't take my pencil. My tongue buzzed like crazy and later I found it in her desk. I thought it was just in my head, but it kept happening. In middle school, when kids said they didn't copy my homework, buzz. When they claimed they weren't talking about me behind my back, buzz. By 8th grade, I realised I had some kind of superpower, but it freaked me out. I stopped shaking hands with people because what if they were lying about something and I could taste it? I stopped eating at potluck because what if someone lied about washing their hands? My classmates already thought I was weird, so I never told anyone. But my gift made me unbeatable at group projects and friend drama. People thought I just had really good instincts about people. I didn't correct them. Then junior year happened and everything changed. My mom had been dating this guy, Trevor for about 6 months. He was one of those smooth talkers who remembered everyone's birthday and always brought flowers. Mom was totally smitten. But every single time Trevor opened his mouth around me, my tongue went fuzzy. Not just a little tingle, but full on electric Shock mode when he said he loved spending time with our family. Buzz when he complimented my mom's cooking. Buzz when he claimed he was just looking out for us. Buzz, Buzz, Buzz. The guy was a walking lie detector nightmare. I tried telling my mom about my bad vibes, but she brushed it off as teenage attitude. She said I was just protective and needed to give him a chance. But I knew something was wrong. One afternoon I came home early from school and caught Trevor in my room. He was holding my tablet, scrolling through it like he owned the place. When he saw me, he didn't even look embarrassed. Hey, kiddo, just checking this for viruses, he said with that fake smile. Your mom asked me to make sure you're staying safe online. My tongue practically exploded. The buzzing was so intense I could barely think straight. He was lying through his teeth. My mom would never ask you to do that, I said. He shrugged. She worries about you. You know how moms are more buzzing. I grabbed my tablet from him and told my mom everything when she got home. But Trevor had already spun some story about me being disrespectful and trying to cause problems in their relationship. Mom took his side. That's when I decided to set a trap. I left my tap.

Emily was 8 and had this weird obsession with my chemistry study partner Conrad. Every Tuesday and Thursday when he'd come over, she'd magically appear with some urgent eight year old business. Can I show you my rock collection? Do you wanna see me do a cartwheel? Did you know I lost a tooth yesterday? Conrad was incredibly patient with her, always stopping whatever we were doing to admire her latest drawing or listen to her explain why unicorns were scientifically possible. I kept apologizing but he just laugh and say she reminded him of his little cousins back home. He actually seemed to enjoy her interruptions, which made me like him even more. One Thursday, Emily cornered me in the kitchen while Conrad was in the bathroom. You need to teach Conrad how to braid hair, she whispered urgently. Why would I do that, em? Because when you guys get married and have daughters, he'll need to know how to do their hair for school. It's basic dad requirements. I nearly choked on my water. We're not getting married. We're just study partners. She rolled her eyes. He looks at you funny when you're working on equations. Like how dad looks at mom when she's making pancakes. Trust me, I'm very observant about Romance things. The next week, she orchestrated her master plan. Right before Conrad arrived, she accidentally left her favorite doll, Bella, in the living room, hair completely tangled. When Conrad walked in, Emily gasped dramatically. Oh, no.

So I let go completely. Two years later, I walked into that house party with a crowd that left her absolutely stunned. Regina ended it twice. First time at her apartment after dinner. I need space. You're always here, always texting, always needing to know where I am. Second time when I tried to fix things a month later. You're too clingy. You have no life outside of us. That word destroyed me. Clingy, like loving someone completely was a character flaw. Three days later, she was already posting stories with hunter, one of our mutual friends from the group. The same hunter who'd been at every game night, every birthday, every random Tuesday hangout. They weren't even subtle about it. Same coffee shop we used to go to, same booth, same drinks. Except now hunter was sitting where I used to be. Our entire friend group just rolled with it. Hunter and Regina just clicked. They'd say like I'd never existed. Like three years of being part of their circle meant nothing. Lorelei, who I helped move twice, suddenly couldn't text back. Graham, who'd crashed at my place countless times, acted like we'd never met. They chose side without anyone asking them to, was completely alone. No girlfriend, no friends, no weekend plans, no one to text stupid memes to. So I did the only thing I could, started saying yes to everything. Coworker mentioned, a hiking group. Yes. Random gym buddy. Invited me to trivia night. Yes. Neighbor needed someone for their recreational basketball team. Absolutely. Yes. The hiking group LED to Anna, Declan and Carlos, three people who actually wanted to hang out. Trivia night introduced me to an entire crew of movie nerds who did weekly screenings. Basketball connected me to guys who grabbed beers without making it feel like an obligation. Within six months, I had three different group chats going, multiple invites every weekend. Inside jokes with people who didn't know Regina existed. He knew me as the guy who was always down for whatever, not the clingy ex who got dumped. While I was building an actual life, Regina and hunter were imploding. According to Instagram, their posts went from constant to sporadic couple photos replaced with solo shots. Hunter's friends would occasionally mention drama when I ran into them. She's jealous of everyone. Can't handle him having other friends. Sound familiar? A year and a half in, I met Zoe at a concert my new friends dragged me to. She was there with her roommates dancing like nobody was watching. We talked between sets about the most random things. She collected vintage postcards, had opinions about every food truck in the city, made me laugh until my sides hurt. When she asked for my number, she said it was because I seemed like someone with good friend group energy. Four months of dating before the universe decided to be hilarious. Her roommate Rachel, was dating Someone named Graham. Yeah, that Graham, my former friend who'd ghosted me when Regina chose hunter. When Zoe mentioned meeting Rachel's boyfriend's.

So I drove him straight into another state while he slept. Mr Maya was the kind of teacher who got off on making students miserable. In AP history, he'd lean over your desk during tests, breathing coffee breath down your neck while tapping his pen on your paper just to throw you off. And when he handed back essays drowned in red ink, he always had his favourite line. In the real world, this wouldn't fly. I spent all junior year counting down to summer, marking days off my calendar like a prisoner, thinking I'd finally be free of his polyester blazers and power trips. So when I walked into the driver's ed two weeks later and saw him sitting behind the instructor's desk, my stomach dropped like a stone. Where do I turn, I asked during our first lesson, gripping the wheel nervously. You don't turn unless I say to, he barked, making me swerve slightly. Just assume you're going straight until I say otherwise, though with your steering straight is a pretty loose term. The two other girls in the backseat exchange looks through the rearview mirror. When Sophia gripped the wheel too tight, he chuckled. Death grip won't help you drive better, sweetheart. This isn't a strength test. Emily stalled at a stop sign and he slapped his knee laughing. And this is why I keep my seatbelt extra tight. With you girls never know. When we're gonna stop or if we're gonna stop. By the third lesson we discovered his pattern. He'd make his nasty jokes for 20 minutes, then use the afternoon drives as nap time while we practiced highway driving. Don't worry about that curb you just kissed said. When I beard slightly, I'm sure it'll recover from the trauma unlike my neck. When Sophia asked about parallel parking, he laughed. You can barely handle forward parking and you wanna try parallel? That's adorable. He spent the entire next lesson bragging about his important dinner plans with his wife if we survive today's lesson. That is 3 teenage girls driving. I should update my will. One afternoon, Sophia slightly bearded and he exploded. Jesus, are you trying to collect mailboxes? Cause you're doing great. He wiped tears from laughing so hard. You know, girls like you three are why insurance rates are so high and why driving instructors need hazard pay. It's funny because it's true. Then he made his final comparison. My 5 year old nephew has better control of his big wheel than you girls have of this car. He was still chuckling when he added, just try not to kill us while I, and then he was snoring, head tilted back against the headrest. I looked at Emily and Sophia in the rearview mirror and something passed between us. That's when I realised he told me to never turn unless he said so. The interstate entrance was coming up On the right and I could see the big green sign marking I ninety five north hanging over the highway. Like a dare, I tilted my head slightly toward it and Emily caught my glance, following my eyes to the sign before whispering. I didn't hear him say turn, while Sophia nodded slowly and added, me neither. I glanced down at the fuel gauge showing a full tank. Back at the sleeping Mister Maya. And as we approached the on ramp and I felt the car naturally wanting to continue straight onto the interstate, I took a deep breath and tightened my grip on the wheel. Well, he did say to follow his instructions exactly. The merge onto the interstate was smooth and Mister Maya kept snoring while the highway stretched endlessly ahead. Thirty minutes passed, then an hour and his phone started buzzing in the cup holder with increasing frequency. We passed the welcome to New Jersey sign after two hours, making Emily stifle a nervous giggle as his phone lit up. Con.

My roommate Lisa was doing her nightly skincare routine when we heard glass breaking downstairs. She just applied a thick green face mask and was wearing her ratty bathrobe with hair and rollers. Did you hear that? I whispered. Lisa grabbed her phone to call 9 1 1, but then got this evil grin. I have a better idea. She crept to the top of the stairs and let out the most blood curdling scream I've ever heard, then started speaking in tongues. Literally just gibberish that sounded vaguely Latin. Spiritus Malum, enter this vessel. I heard the burglar drop something and curse. Lisa crawled down the stairs backwards like the girl from the Exorcist, still screaming in her made up demon language. The green face mask was cracking, making her look legitimately terrifying. The burglar was backing toward the window when our other roommate, Ben, emerged from his room. He immediately caught on. The possession is spreading! He yelled. Everyone get the salt! Ben started throwing table salt everywhere while chanting the Pokemon theme song in a deep, ominous voice. The burglar was now pressed against the wall. Our TV forgotten on the floor. Please, he begged. I'll leave. I'm sorry. Lisa's head snapped toward him. She put in her glow in the dark Halloween contacts. In the dim light, her eyes were literally glowing green. You disturbed the ritual, she growled. That's when our fourth roommate, Kevin Joined in. He emerged, playing his violin badly, just screeching notes while swaying like he was in a trance. The demons need music! Ben shouted, now drawing symbols on the wall with ketchup. Play louder! The burglar tried to run, but Lisa's spider walked toward him at surprising speed. He actually screamed. I need an old priest and a young priest, I yelled, getting into it. I'm Protestant! The burglar cried. I don't know any priests! Lisa stood up suddenly, did a perfect backbend and whispered, then you're screwed! The man literally wet himself. I saw the stain spreading on his jeans. Kevin's violence screeching intensified. Ben was now speaking in Klingon. Lisa started doing that creepy clicking sound from the grudge. The burglar fell to his knees. What do you want from me? Your soul, Lisa hissed. Or your confession. I'll confess. I've robbed 12 houses. I'll tell you everything! He started listing addresses, eightes where he'd sold stuff. Ben was frantically taking notes while still pretending to be possessed. When the cops arrived, they found a burglar in tears, begging for an exorcist. Lisa, still in full green face mask and glowing contacts. Catch up! Demon symbols on our walls! Kevin playing my heart will go on badly on violin. Ben reading the burglar his rights and clanging on. The burglar immediately confessed to everything, begged the cops to take him to a church instead of jail. Kept asking if we were really human. The officer looked at Lisa. Ma'am, what exactly happened here? Skincare night, she said sweetly. Very important for your pores. They took the burglar away. He was muttering about the green demon and violin of the damned. Cops came back later for our statements. One of them finally cracked. In 20 years on the force, I've never had a perp bag for holy water in the squad car. Turns out the burglar had been hitting houses in our area for months. His full confession cleared over a dozen cases. The detective said whatever you did probably saved him from years more crime. He found religion real quick. Already signed up for seminary school. Lisa's review of her faith.

I spent 15 years building the internet infrastructure for our small town in Nebraska. Everyone knew me as the internet guy. When your Wi-Fi went down at 2:00am, you called me. When you wanted faster speeds for your home office, I was your guy. What most people didn't know was that I didn't work for some big company. I owned every cable, every tower and every router box in town. I was the provider. Everything started falling apart when Jerry Davidson got elected to City Council. This guy had been gunning for me ever since I refused to give him free internet for his campaign office two years earlier. At the first town meeting, Jerry stood up with this big presentation about bringing in competition. I need options, he said, pointing at charts showing how much cheaper national providers were. Alex has had a monopoly too long. The new company, Net Connect, rolled into town with promises nobody could refuse, half the price, double the speeds and a name people recognized from TV commercials. They set up a booth at the farmers market offering gift cards just for signing up. Within three months, I watched my customer base get cut in half. By six months, I had maybe 30 customers left out of 800. People stopped waving when they saw me around town. Mrs. Henderson, who used to bring me cookies every Christmas, wouldn't even make eye contact. At the grocery store, Pete's Diner. Conversations would stop when I walked in. Some people actually laughed when Jerry made jokes about my outdated service during council meetings. I tried everything. Lowered my prices below cost, offered free installation, threw in premium channels. Nothing worked. Net connected poisoned the well. My savings account hit zero. My girlfriend Katie left me for some guy who worked at the bank. My business was circling the drain and I was three months behind on my truck payment. That's when I started reading contracts real carefully. See, Net Connect had signed a deal with the city to run their fiber cables through existing infrastructure. They were using my utility poles, my access boxes, and most importantly, my signal towers. The contract gave them access, but only if I granted maintenance permissions. Harry had been so excited to stick it to me that he never bothered reading the fine print. When the city originally gave me exclusive rights to install towers 15 years ago, I wrote a clause that let me shut down signal access with 60 days notice. Back then, it seemed like a smart way to protect my investment. Now it was my nuclear option. I spent three nights going through every page of every contract that connects infrastructure piggyback completely on my original network backbone. They never laid fresh lines because it would have cost millions. They just plugged into what I'd already built and called it an upgrade. On a Tuesday morning, I walked into City Hall. And filed my 60 day notice to terminate signal access. Harry was there picking up some paperwork and saw me at the counter. He asked what I was doing with a smug grin on his face. Just some routine maintenance paperwork, I told him. Netconnect's lawyers showed up exactly one week later.

It's the least you could do for family. The room falls silent. I connect my phone to the TV. A legal document fills the screen. This is a restraining order I filed 14 years ago after you kicked me out at 18. We never kicked you out, mom protests. I slept in my car for two weeks in February in Boston. I swipe to the next screen. After I left, some one opened three credit cards and a personal loan in my name. Total debt, $45,000. Mom goes white. Cassandra stares at her wine. The cards were used at stores Cassandra frequented. The loan deposited into an account that transferred the exact amount to Eric's checking. Eric turns to his wife. You told me that was a gift from your mother. I zoom in on the loan signature. Someone forged my name but spelled my middle name wrong. Why weren't we arrested? Cassandra asks. Because I was 18 and terrified. I paid off all $45,000 myself over three years while working three jobs through college, every cent plus interest. I pull up payment records. Cassandra posted vacation photos. I was eating cheap meals and pulling all nighters to pay off debt I never incurred. Eric looks ill. I swipe again. I discovered 6 failed business ventures Cassandra invested in without your knowledge, Eric, using joint funds. Total losses exceeded $200,000. Those were personal loans, Cassandra blurted. You came here to claim my home, assuming I'd sacrifice myself again. For Cassandra's wants. I say calmly, that will never happen. Where is your compassion, mom demands. Where was yours when I was sleeping in my car when you stole my identity before I'd even started college? Mom grabs her purse. Cassandra, we're leaving. My business partner, Stephanie, speaks up. This is a Celebration of Hazel's home, not a venue for attempted property theft. Eric stays. Days later, he files for divorce after discovering more hidden debts. I. I established education funds for my niece and nephews, accounts that can only be used for school, protecting them from history repeating itself. The journey from sleeping in my car at 18 to owning this home at 32 wasn't just about financial success. It was about reclaiming my worth and refusing to be a doormat ever again.

Then mom said, pack your bags. I smiled, took out my phone and showed them the document that changed everything. The marble countertops and hardwood floors in my new home represent every all nighter I pulled building my tech company. But watching my sister Cassandra strut in with our mother, Eleanor, something in their expressions makes my skin crawl. I've seen that look before. When I was 18, the night that changed everything. Growing up in Boston, Cassandra was always the golden child. When she married into money at 22, mom spent $50,000 on her wedding. I was 19, working two jobs through community college. With each of Cassandra's three children, she grew more entitled to family support. Despite marrying rich, they lived beyond their means. When they hit financial trouble, mom bailed them out at my expense. Your sister has three children to feed, mom would say. What do you need extra money for? Meanwhile, I worked myself to exhaustion. Barista in the mornings, tutor in the afternoons, data entry on weekends. On my 18th birthday, I found them at the kitchen table with my college paperwork. I need your college fund, mom stated. Cassandra needs a bigger house. You have scholarships already. My college fund, the money dad set aside before the divorce, that's my money for education, I said. Cassandra rolled her eyes. Don't be selfish. We're talking about a home for Your niece and nephews take out loans like everyone else. Years of being second best finally broke something inside me. No. Mom's expression hardened. If that's your attitude, pack your bags. You're 18 now. I packed that night, slept in my car for two weeks. In February in Boston, my computer science professor noticed me dozing in the library. She gave me her guest room and helped me secure scholarships. I built a financial app with my best friend. Five years later, we sold it. I became a millionaire at 30. Now, at my housewarming, Cassandra addresses my 30 guests. This house is perfect for my family, she announces. With Eric's job situation and the kids needing good schools, Hazel, single? No kids. This is wasted on one person when we have 3 growing children. Mom nods. Pack your bags and find a condo.

Like a death sentence. Everyone stared at me, waiting for my reaction. They expected me to argue, to plead, to back down, as I had done so many times before. Clara had a smug, triumphant look on her face. She thought she had me trapped. I didn't say a word for a full minute. I looked at her, standing there in all her defiant arrogance. I looked at her enabling parents nodding in approval. I looked at my own parents, their faces a mixture of shock and quiet at dignity. The long game was over. She had just shown me the final results, and the structure was condemned. I gave a slow, deliberate nod. Okay, I said quietly. The word was so devoid of emotion that it seemed to confuse her. Okay, she repeated mockingly. Okay. You'll behave? Okay? You'll stop being a jealous child? No, I said, standing up from the table. I folded my napkin and placed it on my plate. Okay. I won't marry you. I turned to my parents. Mom, dad, we're leaving. Without another look at Clara or her stunned family, the three of us walked out of the house and out of their lives. The next morning, I called our wedding planner. The wedding is off permanently. Do not send out invitation. In cancellation process for all vendors. Clara's family will handle all financial matters. They were paying for everything. Her father had made sure everyone knew he was funding the six Figure wedding, now the burden of unwinding it was his problem. The final Bill for lost deposits and cancellation fees was close to $100,000. When he called me screaming about the money, I was calm. You were there, Richard. You heard her deliver an ultimatum. She made our marriage conditional, and I simply declined the condition. There is no lawsuit. There's only the Bill for a party you're no longer hosting. Clara showed up at my house using her key, finding me packing her belongings. You can't kick me out. I live here. No, Clara, I said. You've been staying here. This is my house. My name is on the deed. Be changing the locks tomorrow. She broke down completely. Crying, begging, saying she didn't mean it. But the time for that was before she made her ex boyfriend a condition of our marriage. A year later, I'm thriving. I'm dating Sarah, a doctor with a wonderful family. Clara is living with her bankrupt parents, working part time at a boutique. Leo is engaged to someone else and made it clear Clara isn't part of their modern family.

If you don't like that, don't marry me. Everyone stared at me. I just said, okay. By the next week, invitations were canceled and she realized the marriage was too. We've been together five years. Throughout our relationship, there was always a third person. Leo, her ex boyfriend. It was at every holiday, birthday and family dinner. He had a key to her parents house. I'd made my feelings clear from the beginning. I believe in boundaries. A past relationship should be in the past, not making inside jokes with your future wife at dinner. My objections were met with condescending lectures from Clara and her therapist parents about my possessive tendencies and inability to embrace a modern concept of family. I went along with it because I was playing the long game. I wanted to see how far she would push it. The breaking point came at a pre wedding family dinner. My mother had a simple question about the seating chart. Clara, dear, she began, I see you have Leo seated at the main family table. Perhaps one of the friends tables would be more appropriate. The room went Arctic. Clara flushed red. Having your ex at the family table might send a confusing message, I said. Clara turned on me. A confusing message? The only confusing message is that you're still living in the 1950. Leo is family. He was part of My life before you and he will be after, her father chimed in with dripping condescension. Ben, your rigid definitions of relationships are what caused insecurity. Clara and Leo have a beautiful, evolved connection. You should be celebrating that, not trying to control it. It was a perfectly executed two on one attack, with her mother nodding in solemn agreement. They've been practicing this kind of psychological maneuvering for years. But this time was different. This time, my parents were there, watching this woman and her family treat our impending marriage with casual, arrogant disrespect. Clara, feeling emboldened by her parents support, stood up and delivered the line that would end everything. Let me make this perfectly clear for everyone, she announced, her voice loud and clear. My ex will always be part of my life. He will be at our wedding. He will be at our children's baptisms. He will be at our holidays. That is non negotiable.

I was in eighth grade when Kyle, the new kid, started passing out these fancy birthday invitations. They had gold, glitter and said VIP guest in big letters. Kyle was always bragging about how his dad owned five restaurants and his mom was a model. He said they lived in this huge mansion with a pool that had a diving board and a water slide. Everyone in class was losing their minds over this party. Kyle made it sound like it was gonna be the event of the year. He handed me an invite, too. Even though we barely talked. I felt pretty special since all the popular kids were going. The invitation said Saturday at three PM. Kyle had written the address by hand in messy letters. I'd never been to that part of town before, but my mom agreed to drive me, even though she was working crazy overtime that week. We pulled up to the address right on time, but something was totally wrong. There were no decorations, no. No balloons, no cars parked outside. Just this regular old house that looked kind of run down. The lawn needed cutting, and the paint was peeling. My mom double checked the address. Are you sure this is right, Jordan? I pulled out the glittery invitation. Same street name, same house number. This had to be it. Walked up and rang the doorbell. This older woman answered, looking confused as heck. She had gray hair and was wearing a bathrobe. Can I help you? She asked. Um, hi. I'm here for Kyle's birthday party. He invited me. The woman just stared at me. Kyle? I don't know any Kyle, sweetie. My stomach dropped to my feet. My mom stepped up behind me and asked again, thinking maybe the woman misheard. But she shook her head and said no party was happening at her house. No Kyle lived there either. I felt my face get hot with embarrassment. We apologized and walked back to the car. I

The doctor said she had four months with brain cancer, so when she asked to try cigarettes and wine, I figured why not? She's 16 and dying. Normal rules don't apply. We spent three weeks bonding on the back porch. She'd smoke these little cigarettes I bought her and we'd split a beer while talking about everything she'd never get to do. It was beautiful. In this twisted way, she seemed more relaxed than since the diagnosis. Those evenings became sacred to us. She'd tell me about boys she had crushes on but never got to date. We'd talk about college majors she'd researched but would never pursue. She wanted to study marine biology, said she'd always dreamed of swimming with sharks. The irony wasn't lost on either of us that she was more afraid of living than dying. I watched my wife struggle with what we were doing. She'd see us through the kitchen window and her face would crumble, but she never said anything. How do you argue with a dying kid's last requests? How do you be the parent who says no when time is running out? She started taking longer shifts at work, I think to avoid watching us slowly poisoning ourselves. My daughter started sleeping better. The constant anxiety that had consumed her since the diagnosis seemed to fade. With each cigarette, she'd lean against my shoulder and we'd just sit in comfortable Silence, watching the sunset. I memorized those moments knowing I'd replay them forever after she was gone. She told me things during those sessions that broke my heart, how she felt guilty for being sick, how she worried we'd spend all our savings on treatments that wouldn't work. She was scared of the pain, but more scared of leaving us behind. I held her while she cried, both of us smoking and pretending it was helping. The strangest part was how normal it felt after a few days, like this was just what we did now. Father, daughter bonding over beer and cigarettes because the universe dealt us the worst possible hand. Next morning, Doctor Martinez called while we were having breakfast. She put it on speaker, like always, turning the volume all the way up. He sounded strange, like.

So I went to this Applebee's last Friday night around eight PM I get seated at this booth near the back and my waiter comes over. Guy looked like he was in his early 20s, kind of scrawny with this patchy beard. He takes my drink order, just a Coke, and disappears. For like 15 minutes I'm sitting there looking around, watching other tables get their food and I'm still waiting for my damn soda. Finally, he shows up with my Coke, doesn't even apologize, just flops it down and asks what I want to eat. I order the chicken tenders with honey mustard and seasoned fries. Pretty basic stuff. He writes it down and vanishes again. 20 minutes go by, nothing. I can see him at the computer terminal just standing there scrolling on his phone. Other waiters are running around actually doing their jobs, but this guy is just chilling. I try to get his attention a couple times, but he's completely ignoring my section. After another 10 minutes, I flag down a different waitress, older lady with gray hair who looked like she actually cared about her job. I asked her if she knows what happened to my food order. She looks confused and goes to check. Turns out my waiter never even put my order in the system. The lady, her name tag said Janet, looked embarrassed as hell. She apologizes and immediately puts my order In says the kitchen will rush it. But now I've been sitting there for almost an hour with nothing but a warm Coke. My food finally comes out, but guess who brings it? Not my original waiter. Janet brings it over with another apology. The chicken tenders are overcooked and the fries are cold. At this point, I'm just hungry and tired, so I eat it anyway. The whole time I'm eating, I can see my waiter at the bar area talking to some girl who's clearly not working there. He's completely forgotten I exist. Never checked on me once after taking my drink order, never refilled my Coke, never even walked past my table. When I'm done eating, I have to wave down Janet again to get my check. He brings it over and I can tell she feels bad about the whole situation. The total was like 18 bucks. Here's where it gets interesting. Janet hands me the check and quietly says, don't worry about tipping Tommy. He didn't earn it tonight and everyone saw what happened. Apparently, this wasn't the first time this kid had pulled this crap. So I pay my $18 cash exact change and leave zero tip as I'm walking.

The grocery store security footage showed my face hitting the floor. Blood pooled around my head where I cracked it on the tile. When I woke up in the hospital, I immediately threw up blood. You're literally starving to death, the doctor told me. I tried to sit up, but the room spun violently. I need to get back to work. Rent is due tomorrow. She pushed me back down. You're 16 years old and you weigh 80 pounds. Can't be right. When did you last eat a meal? Three days ago, I think. She looked horrified. Where are your parents right now? In the basement, playing their online game, like always. They don't know you're dying? They told me not to bother them unless someone is dead. You almost were dead. Almost doesn't count according to them. She glanced at my chart. You work two jobs and go to school. I work at four in the morning delivering newspapers, then I go to school, then I work at the grocery store until midnight. That it's physically impossible. Red Bull and gas station pills make it possible. You're taking stimulant. I have to pay rent or we get evicted. Your parents don't have jobs? They quit two years ago to become professional gamers. Are they making money from gaming? I laughed. They've made exactly zero dollars. Keep saying fame is coming any day now. How much sleep are you getting? My thoughts kept slipping away like water through my fingers. Three hours on a good night, but usually less. Do you ever feel dizzy or confused? Every single day. But I can push through it. She stared at me in disbelief. Your parents make you work while they stay home gaming all day? They're trying to build their streaming career. They need my support. She examined my arms, which looked like twigs. 40 pounds underweight because you're feeding them instead of yourself. You don't understand. They should be able to follow their dreams after the sacrifices they made for me. My manager, Jimmy, had been sitting in the corner listening. He finally spoke up, looking sick with guilt. I should have said something sooner. This kid has been falling apart for months. He has been seeing things at work that aren't real. The doctor turned to him quickly. What kind of things? Yeah. he was having full conversations with nobody for 20 minutes straight. I felt my face get hot. Sometimes when I'm really tired, I see shadows that aren't there. That's your brain literally shutting down from exhaustion. Jimmy looked broken. And last week I found him unconscious in the freezer. He had been in there for 40 minutes and had blue lips. I was just resting my eyes. You could have died. But I didn't, so it's fine. The doctor checked my blood work again. Your body is failing and you're still defending them? They're my parents. I owe them everything. You don't owe them your life. Without me, they'll be homeless. Without them, you'd be healthy. The doctor called Child Protective Services and a social worker arrived within an hour. They tried calling my parents 23 times before anyone answered. The doctor put them on speaker so the social worker could record everything. I could hear battle sounds and screaming from their game in the background. This better be important because you just made us lose a ranked match. The doctor spoke calmly. This is the hospital calling about your son who collapsed at work. What does that lazy piece of garbage want now? He's in critical condition from severe malnutrition. My dad exploded. Of course. I should have just let him die when he was born instead of wasting 16 years feeding him. Everyone in the room froze. Your son is hospitalized with severe exhaustion and malnutrition. The doctor said carefully. That lazy waste of space better not miss his shift tomorrow or we'll all be homeless. My mom grabbed the phone. Next, he has to give us $800 by tomorrow or I'm selling everything he owns. The doctor's voice got ice cold. Your child's organs are failing from working to support you. Stop making excuses for that pathetic failure because he can't handle it.

I was 17 when I found out about the secret group chat. It happened totally by accident when I was trying to airdrop a funny video to my mom's phone. But when I looked for her device, I saw something called fam real instead of just mom's iPhone. That was weird. So when she left her phone charging in the kitchen later, I checked it out. My stomach dropped when I saw the group members, Mom, Dad, my older brother Jake, my sister Emma, and even Aunt Beth, everyone except me. I scrolled through their messages from that day. They were planning dinner at this new Italian place downtown. Jake had sent a picture of the menu and Emma was joking about how dad always orders the same pasta. Normal family stuff, except I wasn't invited. Then I saw something that made my chest tight. Emma had written, should we tell Natalie about dinner? Mom replied, she'll just complain about the food or say she's too busy. Dad added, let's keep it simple tonight. I kept scrolling back through weeks of messages. There were plans for mini golf, movie nights, even a trip to the zoo, all happening without me. In one conversation, Jake mentioned how they went to see the new Marvel movie. I had asked them about it the next day and they said it was sold out. The worst part was a conversation from Three months ago, Aunt Beth had written, we should probably include Natalie more. Mom's response was, she makes everything awkward. Remember her birthday dinner? Emma chimed in. She complained about the restaurant being too loud the whole time. Jake added, plus, she always has her headphones in. Anyway, my birthday dinner, the one where I wore my favorite dress and actually tried to join their conversations, I thought we had a good time. Apparently, they spent the whole night annoyed with me. I found messages about a family trip to the mountains last winter. They had gone skiing for a whole weekend. When I asked where everyone was, they told me they were visiting grandma. I even texted grandma to see how she was doing, and she seemed confused about why I thought they were there. There were inside jokes I didn't understand, references to things that happened when I wasn't around. Jake had sent a picture of dad wearing Mom's reading glasses and everyone was laughing about it. Emma wrote, classic dad moment, No. 847. I had no idea what that meant. I sat in the dark kitchen reading message after message. They talked about me like I was some annoying neighbour kid, not their daughter and sister. In one thread, they were discussing Christmas plans. Aunt Beth suggested we all go to her cabin, dad wrote. Sounds great, but what about Natalie? Mom replied. We'll figure something out. My hands were shaking as I scrolled to the very Beginning of the chat, it started eight months ago right after my 17th birthday. The first message was from Emma. Finally, we can plan stuff without drama. Jake had replied, best birthday present ever. I heard footsteps coming toward the kitchen. I quickly closed the phone and pretended to get water from the fridge. Mom walked in and smiled at me like nothing was wrong. Hey, sweetie, how was your day? I wanted to scream. I wanted to show her what I found and ask why they hated me so much. Instead, I just said it was fine and went to my room. That night, I lay in bed thinking about every family moment from the past year. All the times they said plans fell through or events were cancelled. All the times they came home laughing about something and stopped when they saw me. All the times I felt left out and thought I was being paranoid. The next morning at breakfast, they were all.

The finding out was biblical. I show up to practice Thursday night at the regular time and my three bandmates are sitting in a circle without their instruments like they're about to hold an intervention. Lead singer says, we need to talk about the band's future. Battle of bands is in 10 days and apparently we need to level up our image. That's when I know it's the drummer's girlfriend standing in the corner holding a bass, my bass actually, that I let him borrow last week. She's holding it upside down. Lead singer looks at me, look, you're great and all, but she has the look we need. She's been learning bass for like two months. Two months. I've been carrying this band for three years. But sure, let's get the girl who thinks a bass has six strings. They vote 3 to 1 to replace me right there with me watching like I'm getting voted off a reality show. The guitarist who still can't play an F chord cleanly actually says it's nothing personal. Nobody's looking at the bassist anyway. Might as well have someone pretty back there. Nobody's looking at the bassist. I wrote half our songs. But okay, Brad, tell me more about how music works. The drummer's girlfriend tries to be nice. You can still come to the show if you want to support us, support them. Sure. Let me buy a ticket to watch you play my bass badly. Sounds like a Dream Friday night. I don't argue, don't yell. Just say okay if that's what you all want. The lead singer seems surprised I'm not fighting back. Probably expected tears. Sorry to disappoint. They're already talking about keeping the band name and the set list for battle of bands. Acting like everything's normal. Planning tomorrow's practice like I was never even there. Like I'm already a ghost. Guitarist mentions they'll see me around and I just nod, give them a smile that doesn't reach my eyes, walk out quietly. I can hear them talking about stage positions as the door closes, how she'll look right in the back, how the judges will love having something nice to look at. They think this is over. They think I'm just going to crawl away and cry. That's cute. I'm sitting in my car in the driveway and my brain starts doing math. Tomorrow's practice. They kept saying see you at practice tomorrow to each other. But wait, that's my amp the guitarist uses because his sounds like a dying cat. My mixing board that makes our lead singer not sound like he's through a kazoo. The mic system I bought with birthday money, the cables, the stands, hell even the extension cords are mine. I check the battle of bands registration on my phone. The song list they submitted. Breaking Chains. I wrote that. Midnight Drive wrote that in my bedroom. Phoenix Rising, that's literally about my ex boyfriend. I have the notebooks. With the original lyrics in my handwriting. The van we use for gigs, mine, well, technically my mom's, but she lets me use it. And then it hits me, this is my dad's garage. Dad only lets them practice here because of me. I text him, hey, the band just kicked me out for not being pretty enough. He text back immediately, are you kidding me? They're banned. I'll change the garage code right now. My dad's the best. They kept saying, see you at practice tomorrow. They actually think they're still practicing here tomorrow in my dad's garage with my equipment, playing my songs. The delusion is actually impressive. Next day, five PM, I'm home.

I used to fake sick at least once a month. Nothing dramatic, just your classic ugh, my stomach hurts routine. I'd shuffle into the kitchen, wrap myself in a blanket, throw in a little cough and wait for my mom to sigh and say, fine, but no video games. She always fell for it or maybe she just didn't care enough to argue. This time felt no different. It was a Thursday. I had a math test I wasn't ready for and zero energy to through Mr Danner's 45 minute rant about fractions. So I pulled out the old stomachache move. My mom was already halfway out the door for work, so she just nodded and left. I grabbed a bowl of cereal, flopped onto the couch and turned on some cartoons, already feeling like I'd won. Dad works nights, so he usually sleeps through most of the day and the house stays quiet. But around 10:00, I heard his door open. I muted the TV and listened. He walked past the living room without noticing me, phone in hand, and stepped out into the garage. Didn't think much of it at first. Figured maybe he was calling in sick or trying to get a refund for something. But then I heard his voice through the wall and it wasn't his normal voice. It was quiet, tired, flat. I can't do this anymore, he said. I paused. I tried. I Really tried, but I feel like I don't even know my family anymore. I come home and everything's just cold. I tiptoed down the hall, heart suddenly racing. The garage door was cracked open, just like always, and I crouched beside it. I know this isn't what we wanted, but it's where we are now. He said, every day I feel like I'm just pretend ending, pretending to be fine, pretending to be a good husband, a good dad. My stomach twisted. This time for real. I mean, look at him, he said. He doesn't even like me. He doesn't talk to me unless he wants something. And when he does, it's just one word answers. I don't even know who he is anymore. My throat went dry. I look at him and all I can think is what happened? What did I do wrong? When did he start looking at me like I was a stranger? There was silence then. I know it's awful, but sometimes I wonder if I'd be happier alone, just starting over, somewhere quiet, somewhere nobody knows me. My chest felt like it caved in. I haven't said anything to her yet, he continued. I don't even know if I will, but I can't keep going like this. I'm exhausted. I backed away from the door before I could hear more. I stumbled into the bathroom and locked the door behind me, sat on the edge of the tub and stared at the floor. He Didn't know I was home. He didn't know I was listening. And he definitely didn't know I had just realized something I could never unhear. My dad didn't just feel lost, he felt lost because of me. I stayed in the bathroom for over an hour just trying to breathe. When I finally came out, he was back in his room. I crept into mine, got under the covers and didn't move for the rest of the day. Later that night, he knocked on my door. How's your stomach, he asked. Fine, I mumbled. Need anything? No. He stood there for a second longer, then said, okay, let me know. I said nothing.

I was waiting in line at Starbucks when this kid, maybe 13, ordered a drink so complicated the barista had to write it down. Venti iced skinny hazelnut macchiato, sugar free syrup, extra shot, light ice, no whip, with exactly 2.5 pumps vanilla. One pump caramel coffee at 140 degrees in a venti cup with extra foam below the rim. The barista made it the it took one sip and exploded. This is wrong. It's 142 degrees. I said 140! Are you stupid? His mom stood there nodding. Jaden has a very refined palate. You need to remake it. The barista apologized and started over. Meanwhile, the line grew longer. An elderly man behind me sighed. The kid heard him. Do you have a problem, old man? Maybe go to McDonald's if you can't wait for quality. His mother actually laughed. Aiden, be nice. Not everyone understands coffee like you do. The second drink came out. Kid took a sip and spat it onto the counter. Now it's too cold. And this is three pumps vanilla. Can nobody here count? The manager came over, apologizing profusely. We'll make it again, no charge. No charge! We're not paying for any of this! The mom snapped. This is harassment! While waiting for drink No. 3, the kid knocked over the tip jar accidentally. Coins scattered everywhere. He watched the barista pick them up and smirked. Maybe if You made drinks correctly, you deserve tips. A woman in line called out, that's incredibly rude. The kid's mom world around. Excuse me, don't parent my child. Someone should. The woman muttered. The kid heard and started fake crying. Mom, she's bullying me! I'm just trying to get my drink. His mother immediately pulled out her phone. I'm recording this. This. This woman is harassing my minor child! The manager panicked, offered everyone free drinks to calm things down. The kid instantly stopped crying. I want a free drink card too, for my emotional distress. They gave him one. A twenty five dollar gift card for acting like a monster. The third drink came out. He tasted it, considered, and poured it on the floor. Still wrong. You know what? I'll make it myself since everyone here is incompetent. He tried to walk behind the counter. The manager blocked him. You can't come back here. My dad owns three Starbucks franchises. Yes, I can. His mom nodded. Let him fix your mistakes. The manager, exhausted, said they'd comp the drink, but he couldn't go behind the counter. The kid grabbed a display mug and threw it against the wall. Then make it right. Ceramic shards everywhere. A baby in the corner started crying from the noise. His mother's response, now look what you made him do. He has anger issues when people don't listen. The manager called security. The mom went ballistic. You're calling security on a child? I want Every employee here fired. While she ranted, the kid walked over to the condiment bar and started opening every single milk carton, sugar packet, and napkin dispenser, dumping them on the floor. Oops! He said after each one. So clumsy today. An off duty cop in line finally stepped forward.

I raised my hand as a joke. I helped my mom watch YouTube videos when she was pregnant with my brother. Does that count? The class laughed and I smiled, proud of my quick thinking. But Mister Gonzales wasn't smiling. His face had gone completely white and his hands were shaking as he gripped the edge of his desk. Good. Come with me now. The entire classroom went silent in South Dallas when a teacher used that tone. You didn't ask questions. Everyone stay in your seats. Do not leave this room. If I'm not back in 20 minutes, have someone call 9, 1 1. He was already pulling me toward the door and that's when I noticed the dark stain on his sleeve. Wet. It looked like blood. Mr Gonzales, what's happening? Is someone hurt? I tried to pull my arm free, but his grip was iron tight. I don't think I'm qualified for whatever. You're the only one who raised their hand. He cut me off. That makes you qualified. Outside, his car was already running with the doors open. She said she had until Thursday. He kept muttering while speeding out of the school parking lot. The midwife isn't answering her phone I the door handle, calculating if I could jump out at the next red light. Mr Gonzales, you're scaring me. Should I call my mom? No. He swerved around. A car and I slammed into the window. No one can know. Put your phone away. Turn it off. I'm not turning off my phone, I shouted. But I did anyway. We were going 50 in a 25 zone and Mr Gonzales kept checking his mirrors like someone was following us. Finally, he pulled into a driveway of a small yellow house that definitely wasn't his. Listen to me. He grabbed my shoulders before we got out. They can't know she was here. Do you understand? No matter what happens, they can't know. I don't understand anything. I was practically yelling, now I'm 17. I don't even have my license yet. Marco. He used my name for the first time, his voice desperate. You've kept bigger secrets than this. I know your family. I need that same silence now. He wasn't wrong. I'd already seen two drive bys this year and never said a word to the cops. But this felt different. He shoved a pair of surgical gloves into my hands. Put these on. The front door was unlocked. Inside, we followed the sound of crying to a back bedroom where a woman was curled up on a bare mattress. She looked young, maybe early 20s, with long black hair stuck to her face with sweat. It's too early, she gasped in accented English when she saw us. Then she looked at me and started crying harder. He's just a child. You brought a child. I'm 17, I said. Stupid like that made any difference? I watch Grey's anatomy, if that helps. She switched to Spanish and started begging Mister Gonzales for something I couldn't understand. He pushed me toward her. Check how dilated she is. What? I backed up so fast I knocked over.

Phoebe walked up to me at my grocery store job and said, I need you to pretend to be my abusive ex. I dropped the can of soup I was stocking. Phoebe Kang, valedictorian, going to Harvard in the fall. Perfect grades, perfect life, perfect everything. What the hell was she doing talking to me? My actual ex won't leave me alone, she explained, glancing around nervously. He keeps showing up at my house, my work, everywhere. But he's 6 4 or and on the football team. She pointed to herself. I'm 5 2 and my parents think I should just handle it diplomatically. They don't understand that Austin's not taking no for an answer. So where do I come in? You're bigger than him. If he thinks I'm with someone who could actually fight back, maybe he'll back off. I've seen you loading trucks in the parking lot. You're not exactly small. I look down at myself. Yeah, I was bigger. Worked construction summer since I was 16. Built like my dad before he took off. What's in it for me? I'll help you pass calculus. You're failing, right? I've seen your test scores posted outside Morrison's classroom. She wasn't wrong. I needed that credit to graduate. Mom was already stressed enough without me not walking across that stage. Fine. But we do this my way. What do you mean? We're not pretending you're with some psycho. We're showing him You're with someone who actually respects you. What's the difference? Everything. First time we met up, I told her the plan. I pick you up from school, walk you to your car, hold your hand in the hallways, normal boyfriend stuff, but visible. That's it? That's it. No drama, no threats, just present. Phoebe looked skeptical. Austin's not going to back down from hand holding, trust me. The first two days were weird. Phoebe's friends kept staring at us like I was some zoo animal. Whispers followed us down every hallway. What's she doing with him? Isn't that the kid who works at Save Mart? Phoebe heard it, too. I could see her jaw tighten every time someone made a comment. You don't have to do this, I told her after some girl made a crack about my thrift store jacket. Yes, I do, she said, squeezing my hand tighter. Sure enough, Austin showed up the third day. Massive dude, varsity jacket. Looked pissed as hell. Who's this? He demanded, getting right in Phoebe's face like I wasn't even there. I stepped between them. Calm. No.

So she's concerned that she's been friend zoned by you. I mean, she's got a great personality and I would like to be friends with her. Yeah. But the, I mean, the thing is, Michael, nobody's on dating apps to be friends. Like they're looking for dates. I guess that's true. But like, you know, sometimes you meet someone who you, who you click with on more of a friend level and, you know, you, you don't necessarily wanna date them, but you wanna continue being friends. Like I think men and women can be friends. So, you know. Well, I don't, I don't think there's any possibility of men and women ever being friends, ever. You do not believe that. The bottom line, you just feel like you guys are better off being friends and that's it. Yeah, she's very cute. You know, she's just not quite my type, I would say. Okay. So what's your type then? Uh, I mean, my friends always make fun of me for it. So, um, you know. Make fun of you for it. Yeah. Why they make fun of your type of person you like to date? You know, everybody has their type and I just have A different type than a lot of people. I'm dying to know. Is it an eye patch thing? Oh, God, I love people with eye patches. It's always been my thing. Tell me it's eye patches. Uh, no, not quite. I don't have a thing for pirates. I promise you we won't make fun of you if you tell us what your type is. I can trust you. No, of course you can't. But you should tell us anyway. Yeah. Is it like a physical thing or a personality thing? No, it's, it's physical. Okay. So what is it? Uh, okay. Here's the thing about Kara.

The current curriculum specifically mentions this myth as something to correct. I showed her the screen. That's when she asked me to step into the hallway. The kids watched wide eyed as the door closed behind us. Do you have any idea how hard it is to teach these kids when parents undermine my authority? She pissed. Now they'll question everything I say. I kept my voice calm. Isn't that exactly what we want them to do, question things and learn critical thinking? I've been teaching for 22 years, she snapped. I'm not changing my whole curriculum because some nurse thinks he knows better than our textbooks. That night, Lily asked me if she was in trouble because Missus Wilson kept giving her mean looks all afternoon. I assured her she wasn't. The next day, Missus Wilson announced a pop quiz with questions like, what color is blood inside the body? Lily answered red and got marked wrong. She came home crying with a big red F. I requested a meeting with the principal and brought printouts of medical textbooks, state science standards and Lily's Quiz. Principal Davis listened carefully, then called in Missus Wilson. When confronted with the evidence, Missus Wilson insisted, this is how I've always taught it, Principal Davis asked, but is it correct? After a long pause, Missus Wilson said, it's what the children understand better. I lost it. My daughter is crying. Every morning before school because she's afraid of getting F's for writing down the truth. Two weeks later, the school replaced their 1998 science books. Missus Wilson was required to attend professional development on current scientific standards. On Lily's next report card, Missus Wilson wrote excellent critical thinking skills. But at the parent teacher conference, she wouldn't look me in the eye. And when I signed up to help with the science fair, I noticed my name had been crossed off the volunteer list. Lily still checks with me whenever she learns something new at school. Dad, is this actually true or is it just a missus Wilson truth?

I heard Mark's desk neighbor ask him if he smelled it too, and he said yeah, it was disgusting. Around 11 I walked past his desk to grab something from the printer and I swear to god he looked green. Like actually nauseous. He was holding the mug up to his face, about to take a sip, and then he just stopped, put it down, and stared at it. Then he picked it back up and smelled it.

One guy said it smelled like a corpse microwaved in fish oil, which honestly was the most accurate. Description I'd heard all day. Nobody could figure out where it was coming from because by then the mug was just sitting in the sink and the smell had kind of spread everywhere. I waited until everyone went home, washed my mug with actual soap this time, and took it back to my desk, put it in my drawer. The next day, Mark came in with a paper cup from the coffee shop downstairs. And the day after that, and the day after that. He never touched the kitchen mugs again. I started leaving mine back on the shelf after a week, and he wouldn't even look at it. Few days later, I was talking to some co workers near the coffee machine, and I just casually mentioned how gross it is when people use other people's stuff without asking. How you never know what germs or whatever could be on there. A couple people agreed, and one of them looked right at Mark when they said it. He still drinks from paper cups now. Been months.

I live in Colorado and about two years ago I went to Hawaii for like a week with my girlfriend. Best trip of my life, honestly.

I stared at the message for 30 seconds before my hands started shaking so badly I almost dropped my phone. Marcus, after three years behind bars, he was out and somehow he'd already found me. I moved across the country, changed my last name, deleted every trace of my old life online, but none of it mattered if he had my address. My cousin Tyler followed up immediately. Prison buddy told me Marcus has been planning this for months. Dudes obsessed. You need to run now. The apartment suddenly felt exposed. Every window of potential entry point, every shadow of a place. I grabbed my laptop and started searching for flights out of the city. My cursor hovering over destinations that were far enough away but close enough to drive back if needed. But where could I go that Marcus wouldn't eventually find me? He tracked me down before when I thought I was safe. Three years ago, I got in a restraining order after he broke into my apartment and waited in my bedroom closet for six hours until I came home from work. The look in his eyes when I found him sitting on my bed holding my favorite sweater still haunted my nightmares. He calm, almost gentle as he explained how we belong together and how I'd understand eventually if I just stopped fighting what was meant to be. The police had Arrested him that night. But Marcus had violated the restraining order 17 times in the following months, showing up at my job, following me to the grocery store, leaving gifts on my car windshield with notes about how patient he could be. The final incident happened when I was having dinner with friends at a restaurant downtown. Marcus had somehow gotten a job as a delivery driver just so he could walk into the restaurant and approach our table. He'd knelt down beside my chair and proposed with a ring he'd made from braided prison commissary bags, speaking loudly enough for the entire restaurant to hear about how our love had survived his temporary absence. The other diners had thought it was romantic until they saw my face. Friend Rebecca had called 9, 1 1 while Marcus continued his speech about destiny and soulmates. When the police arrived, he'd calmly handed over the ring and told them he understood I needed more time to process my feelings. That was the incident that finally got him three years in state prison for stalking and violating a protective order. Three years that I'd used to build a new life in Seattle, thinking distance and time would keep me safe. I called Tyler back immediately. How did he get my address? I don't know all the details. But his cellmate said Marcus spent whole three years were searching. You had photos printed from your social media before you deleted everything, knew about your Job, your apartment, even your favourite coffee shop. My stomach dropped. What photos? I deleted everything before I moved. Old screenshots, cash pages, stuff friends posted and tagged you in. He had this whole system of keeping track. His cellmate thought it was romantic at first until Marcus started talking about how you were just confused and needed to be reminded of what you meant to each other. I looked around my studio apartment, really seeing it for the first time as Marcus would see it. Ground floor with windows facing the parking lot. No security system, just a chain lock and a dead bolt that anyone with basic tools could defeat. One exit through the front door, no back way out. I'd chosen it because it was affordable and close to work, never thinking about defensibility. Tyler, I need you to do something for me. Call Detective Walsh at Seattle PD. And tell her Marcus Wright was released from Milhaven Correctional and has made threats. Tell her I need to deactivate my case file. Already did that. She's on her way to your place now. Relief flooded through me. Detective Walsh had handled my original case before I moved and she'd been the one to suggest I relocate when Marcus's behavior escalated. She understood how dangerous he was and wouldn't dismiss this as paranoia. Twenty minutes later, Detective Walsh knocked on my door with a uniformed officer beside her. I recognized her immediately. Tyler filled me in. She said Without preamble, we're treating this as an active threat. How long ago did you get the warning? About an hour ago. She nodded and pulled out her phone. I'm calling this into the task force. Marcus Wright is considered high risk and his release should have triggered automatic notification to victims. Someone dropped the ball on protocol. The uniformed officer started walking around my apartment, checking windows and door locks while Detective Walsh interviewed me. She wanted to know about any contact I'd had with Marcus or his associates, any suspicious activity around my building, any feeling that I was being watched. I told her about the weird phone calls I've been getting for the past week. Some one would call, I'd answer, and then they'd hang up without saying anything. I'd assumed it was telemarketers or wrong numbers, but now it felt sinister. Those calls started exactly seven days ago, I said. Checking my phone log, always from different numbers, always during the day when I'd normally be at work. Detective Walsh made notes while the uniformed officer.

Uncle Tommy walked through the door and immediately came over to where I was practicing piano. Still wasting your parents money on those piano lessons? He said. Hey, everyone, listen to this. It's sounds like someone's torturing a bunch of sick geese while they're trying to sing the national anthem. Oh, wait, that's just my nephew playing piano. Everyone laughed nervously, and I turned around on the bench. Uncle Tommy, that's really mean. I've been practicing for months. Could you please stop? He rolled his eyes at me. Don't be such a baby. It's just a joke. If you can't laugh at yourself, you'll never make it in life, kiddo. Then he walked over to my cousin Kim, who just got engaged last month. Hey, everyone, wanna start a betting pool? He was grinning. I give this marriage six months, tops. We all know how desperate Kim was to find anyone who would marry her. Kim's face went bright red, and her fiance looked like he wanted to leave right then. Uncle Tommy kept going, pointing at my sister. Speaking of desperation, here's our family teacher. You know what's funny about teachers? They get paid in crayon drawings and apple juice because that's all they're worth. He laughed at his own joke. At least the kids in your class have someone at their level to relate to, right? My sister ran out of the room. My Grandpa laughed. You kids really are too sensitive. Tommy's just joking around. My aunt nodded and added, it's just his sense of humor. You all need to learn to take a joke. By the time dinner was over, Kim had left early and my sister wouldn't come out of her room. At Christmas, I came ready with my own jokes about Uncle Tommy's life. He walked in wearing another expensive suit, and I announced to everyone, hey, look, everyone! Uncle Tommy wore his fancy suit! You know, the one he bought before his third wife took everything, including his house and his last bit of self respect. His eye twitched, but he laughed it off. During dinner, when he grabbed his fourth beer, I said loud enough for everyone to hear, hey, Uncle Tommy, tell everyone that funny story about when you got so drunk at your son's graduation you tried to give a speech and ended up barfing on the principal's shoes. That was hilarious, right? Your son still won't talk to you, but at least you got a funny story out of it. My mom covered her mouth trying not to laugh, and my dad had to look away. At New Year's, when he tried to make a toast, I jumped up. First, let me tell a joke first. What do you call a guy who's been divorced three times, lost every business he started, and still gives relationship and financial advice? Uncle Tommy. Get it? Because it's funny. How he thinks anyone should listen to him. Uncle Tommy finally lost it. You think you're so funny, don't you? He screamed at me while spit flew out of his mouth, making jokes about my divorces and my mistakes like you're some kind of comedian. It's not funny. It's just mean and disrespectful. I smiled at him, real calm. But, Uncle Tommy, you said, if we can't laugh at ourselves, we'll never make it in life. I'm just helping you laugh at yourself. Why is it suddenly not funny when the jokes are about you? The whole room went dead silent, and Uncle Tommy's face looked like it might explode. Remember when you made my sister cry about her weight at her graduation? I kept going. Or that super funny bit where you told Kim's kids their dad was too stupid to get a real job?

My sister Emma had been planning her wedding for two years and I was supposed to be her maid of honor. She kept dropping hints about how all the bridesmaids needed to look cohesive in the photos and how important it was for everyone to put their best foot forward for her big day. Look, I'm not stupid. I knew what she was getting at. I'd gained about 40 pounds over the past few years since I started working from home. Emma never said it directly, but every time we talked about the wedding, she'd mention some diet she saw on Instagram or asked if I was getting ready for the wedding season. The breaking point came three months before the wedding when we went dress shopping. I tried on the bridesmaid dress in my size and Emma just stared at me in the mirror with this tight smile. She asked if maybe we should size up for comfort and then suggested I might wanna start doing some pre wedding prep with her. That weekend she texted me a link to some fitness app and said, thought this might help with your confidence for the big day. I screenshot that text and sent it to my boyfriend Tyler who said she was being a total bitch. But I decided I'd show her. I downloaded my fitness pal that night and started tracking everything. I cut out all the late night snacking, stopped getting coffee With extra syrup and started walking to the grocery store instead of driving. I wasn't trying to do anything extreme. I just wanted to lose enough weight that Emma couldn't make her little comments anymore. The first month, I lost 12 pounds. Emma noticed right away when we met for brunch and kept asking what I was doing differently. I told her I was just eating better. And she got this weird look on her face like she didn't expect me to actually do anything about it. By month two, I was down 25 pounds and feeling amazing. I bought new jeans that actually fit.

I've been keeping this notebook for six years and my girlfriend had no clue until last week. She always said I never opened up emotionally. But honestly, I just thought guys weren't supposed to talk about all the little things they notice. Growing up, my dad forgot everyone's birthday. My mom couldn't remember who liked what food. Their fights were brutal because nobody paid attention to anyone. I swore I'd never be that type of boyfriend. So in college, I started writing stuff down about whoever I was dating. Not weird stalker stuff, just normal things like how Ashley preferred hot chocolate when it rained but iced coffee when it was sunny. Or how Jessica's voice got higher when she was nervous about something. When I met Mia three years ago, the notebook got way more detailed. I wrote down everything, how she stirred her cereal exactly seven times before eating it, how she hummed the same tune when she was happy, how her left eyebrow twitched right before she'd start laughing at something. Every few weeks, I'd add new stuff, like how she only wore her lucky socks on job interview days or how she needed exactly eight minutes of silence when she got home from work before she could handle talking. I wrote down that she liked her apartment at exactly 72 degrees, not 71 or 73, that she always ordered extra pickles but never ate them, that she got cranky If she didn't eat something by 11:00am but never admitted she was hungry, the notebook helped me figure out when to give her space and when to push her to talk about stuff, when to play upbeat music and when she needed something sad. I knew she was stressed when she started reorganizing her bookshelf, so I'd order her favorite Thai food before she even realized she was hungry. When she was upset, she'd clean the bathroom obsessively so I'd run her a bath afterward. None of this felt calculated or weird to me. It just seemed like paying attention. But I never told her about it because it sounded super intense. When I thought about explaining it, like, hey, hey, babe, I've been documenting your behavior patterns for 3 years. Doesn't exactly sound romantic. Plus, guys don't really talk about this stuff with each other. I figured she'd think I was some kind of control freak or something. Last Tuesday, she was cleaning our home office while I was at work. She called me freaking out, asking why I had a notebook with her name on it hidden behind my desk. Panicked, thinking she'd found something embarrassing. But she said she hadn't opened it yet. She was waiting for me to get home to explain. The drive home felt like forever. I kept imagining her thinking I was documenting her flaws or planning to break up with her or something crazy. When I got there, she was sitting on The

I always had this weird feeling about my Uncle Pete. Like, everyone in my family absolutely loved the guy. He was the fun uncle. You know, the one who'd show up to family barbecues with his loud laugh and those expensive gifts that made all us kids go crazy. He take us out for burgers, let us play games on his phone for hours. And somehow he always knew all the latest slang before we did. But something about Pete just felt off to me. Maybe it was how he'd always squeeze into your personal space when he talked to you, standing way too close. Or how he always wanted to be alone with one of us kids, saying stuff like, let the grown UPS talk and pulling us into another room. My parents thought it was sweet that he wanted to spend time with us. I was 16 when my little cousin Emily started acting different. Emily was always this bubbly kid who asked a million questions and made everyone laugh with her silly jokes. But suddenly she got quiet. Like, really quiet. She stopped joking around completely. Stopped asking her usual why this and why that questions. When I'd ask her what was wrong, she'd just shrug and say she was tired. That wasn't Emily at all. One Saturday, I was helping my dad clean out the garage. We were sorting through old tools and junk when I saw this spare Key hanging on a little hook. It had a label that said Pete in my dad's handwriting. That made zero sense to me. Pete didn't live with us. He had his own apartment across town. Why would he need a key to our house? I asked my dad about it. He just chuckled and said Pete probably made a copy years ago when they used to share tools back and forth. You know how your uncle is always borrowing something dad said. But something about that explanation felt wrong. Pete hadn't borrowed tools in years. That night I couldn't sleep. Something about that key kept bugging me. Why would Pete still need access to our house? Why was the key hanging in the garage where everyone could see it? The more I thought about it, the weirder it seemed. The next day, I decided to fake being sick and stay home from school. I told my mom I had a headache and she believed me. After everyone left for work and school, I just waited. I had this gut feeling that something was going to happen. Around two forty five PM, right before Emily usually walked home from school and stopped by our house to wait for her mom to pick her up, I heard the garage door open, but nobody was supposed to be home. I looked out the window and saw Pete's blue Honda pulling into our driveway. My heart started pounding. Pete walked straight into the garage. Like he owned the place. Grab that key and let himself into the house through the side door. He didn't even knock or call out to see if anyone was home. He just walked right in. I followed him from upstairs, trying to be as quiet as possible. He went straight to the downstairs guest room, where Emily usually waited. When she came over, Pete looked around. Then

The call came through my commanding officer. Your son committed felony assault at his father's wedding. You need to get home now. I was on a base in Germany and hadn't seen my boys in 8 months. Now my teenage son who stopped wrestling because he hated hurting people was facing charges for brutalizing a woman at the altar. After an 18 hour emergency flight, I, I headed to my ex husband's house where my son was. The wife's dark blood was still stained by the driveway. I rang the doorbell. My ex husband Conrad answered. His face twisted with rage. We're pressing charges. I'm not taking anyone's side until I see both, I said. Pushing past him. The living room was a tribunal. Conrad's parents on the couch, his brother Potter by the fireplace, his sister Fen in the corner, the bride's parents standing like guard dogs. And in the center the bride Lauren with a splinted nose, two black eyes, bandages across her face. She was crying, dabbing her eyes carefully around the swelling. And there surrounded by this mob sat my son, my fourteen year old who refused to kill insects because he could have been born an ant who taught his little stepbrother origami. He sat perfectly straight, chin raised, looking me dead in the eyes with zero regret. He looked proud of what he did. Your son destroyed our family, Conrad spat. Look what he did to her face. Lauren sobbed harder. He's an animal. They're trying him as an adult, right? Grandpa shook his head in disgust. I looked at my son. His knuckles were still bruised and swollen. There seemed to be no real excuse. But then I asked for his side of the story. He looked around the room, slowly taking in every face. Then he spoke. Voice clear. You wanna know the truth? She's been molesting me for six months. That's why I did it. My world stopped, but the room exploded instantly. Liar, disgusting. How dare you. Lauren's face shifted for just a second before she wailed louder. He's making it up. I've been nothing but loving. Her mother stepped forward, pointing at my son. You evil little. But her father grabbed her arm, his face pale like he'd been expecting this. In the midst of all the chaos, my son pulled out his phone and swiped to his hidden photos, she said. Fourteen year old boys always want it said. I should be grateful. I saw the images over his shoulder and my stomach turned. Conrad's hands were shaking as he stared at the screen. Those could be anyone could have, but his voice was hollow like he was reading a script. He didn't believe Lauren tried to snatch the phone. Those are out of context. I, it was just she stopped realizing. She just admitted they were real. My son stood up, voice shaking with rage. Dad, I told you three months ago, you said she's just being affectionate. Conrad started stuttering. I didn't. I thought, Grandpa, you laughed. Lucky boy. Wish I had that problem at 14. Grandpa's face went from red to white. He looked at Lauren, then at his grandson, and something crumbled in his expression. Aunt Fenn, you told me, don't be dramatic. Fenn was backing toward the door, tears streaming. Oh, god. Oh, god. I thought you were just Uncle Potter. You said I should be grateful Potter had his head in his hands. Jesus Christ. I was joking. I didn't know she was actually grandma. You said boys can't be great by women. Grandma collapsed into the couch, rosary beads in her hands, whispering prayers. Every single one of you told me to shut up about it. Lauren's parents were having a whispered argument. Her father hissed. Not again, Patricia. You said she was better. The word again hung in the air. But that's not why I hit her. My son cut through. Everyone immediately froze. What do you.

My family discovered I was good with kids when I was 14 and babysat my cousin once. That single afternoon of watching cartoons turned me into their unpaid nanny for the next 12 years. At first, it was just by my sister dropping off her toddler just for an hour while she ran errands. That hour turned into six when she decided to get her nails done instead. I remember sitting on my floor surrounded by broken crayons and goldfish crackers, realizing I'd missed my shift at the coffee shop. My brother joined in with midnight text about his twins needing an emergency sitter for his concert plans. College, they took it even further. My sister would bang on my dorm door and dump her kids for entire weekends. She cost me my first serious boyfriend when she called me during our anniversary dinner screaming about a fake emergency. My boyfriend looked at me across that candlelit table and said he couldn't do this anymore. After graduation, my parents made everything worse by secretly giving my siblings keys to my apartment. I started coming home from my marketing job to find kids destroying my kitchen and toys, taking over my home office. My boss pulled me aside after I'd missed another presentation and told me to figure out my priorities. The moment they took it too far came three months ago when I Woke up to voices in my living room. I stumbled out of my pajamas to find four kids watching cartoons with suitcases next to them. My sister's two kids and my brother's twins were all there eating my cereal like it was just another Saturday. On my counter was a note that made my hand shake. My entire family had booked a month long cruise to Europe and decided not to tell me because I'd make it difficult. Note said they knew I take good care of the kids like I always do. I kept reading it over and over, trying to understand how they could just leave the country without even asking me. My sister had attached a grocery list and my brother left $200 for expenses. Like I was their personal hired help. They could book without notice. The youngest kid looked up and asked if I was making pancakes for breakfast. An innocent question broke something inside me because these kids had no idea their parents had just abandoned them. That's when I decided to teach them what abandonment really felt like. You see, 12 years of forced babysitting had taught me every rule about child welfare and what authorities look for. I made the kids breakfast and told them we were going to play a game where they told me about all the times they'd stayed with me before. I recorded videos on my phone as they excitedly shared stories about being dropped off for days. Without their parents checking in. The seven year old even mentioned the time his mom left him here when he had strep throat. I carefully documented the suitcases, the note, and the pathetic $200 meant to last a month. Then I looked up the number for Child Protective Services. My family thought they were getting a free month in Europe. Instead, they were about to learn what happens when you abandon your children with someone who knows the system. I called CPS and reported four abandoned minors with no guardianship papers. The caseworker arrived within two hours and went pale reading the note. By afternoon, the kids were in emergency.

The bride stopped mid pose, her photographer looked confused, and about 30 wedding guests turned to stare at my three year old daughter, Emma, standing by the playground swings. I was mortified. Emma had this habit of saying random things loudly at the worst possible moments, but this was next level embarrassing. Emma, honey, let's go play on the slides, I whispered, trying to drag her away from the wedding party, but she wasn't having it. She broke free from my grip and marched right up to the bride, tugging on her dress. Lady, don't marry the mean man, Emma said, pointing directly at the groom. He's gonna hurt you. Everyone went dead silent. The groom's face went red and he started walking toward us looking angry. Hey, what kind of kids says something like that? What are you teaching her? I started apologizing, explaining that Emma was just three and had an active imagination. But then the bride knelt down to Emma's level and asked quietly, sweetie, why do you think he's mean? Emma pointed to a bruise on the bride's wrist that was barely covered by her dress sleeve. My mommy had marks like that. When the bad man lived with us, she cried at night, too. Just like you smell like tears under your makeup. My heart stopped. This kid had been through way too much for her age, but she developed This weird ability to spot things adults tried to hide. When my ex was still around, Emma would always know when I'd been crying, even if I thought I'd covered it up perfectly.

Call your mom right now. I looked up, confused because Mr Bax never talked to individual kids unless someone was throwing things or starting fights. He'd been driving Route 47 for like 10 years and barely acknowledged any of us existed. Why? I pulled out my earbuds and walked closer to the front. His knuckles were white from gripping the steering wheel so hard. Just call her right now. His voice had this urgent edge that made my stomach flip. I fumbled for my phone while other kids started complaining about why we weren't moving. We were stopped three blocks before my usual stop on Cedar Lane. Just sitting there with the engine idling. My mom's phone went straight to voicemail. I tried again. Same thing. She's not answering. Mr Bax was staring at something in his side mirror. And when I turned to look, I saw a black sedan that had been following us for the last few turns. Try your dad or anyone else in your family now. I was really freaking out because, but drivers don't care about your family unless something is seriously wrong. I called my dad and got voicemail again. The black car was still there, just sitting behind us with its engine running through the tinted windows, I could see the outline of someone in the driver's seat. Mr Bax, what's going on? My voice Came out higher than I meant it to. He reached for his radio and spoke quietly into it. Base, this is bus 47. I need immediate assistance at Cedar and 5th. Possible situation with suspicious vehicle following my route. The dispatcher's voice crackled back, asking for details, but Mr Bax kept his responses vague. The other kids on the bus were getting restless and starting to ask questions. Ace from the back yelled, Yo, why aren't we moving? I got practice. Mr Bax ignored him and kept watching that black car in his mirror. Kip, I need you to listen very carefully when I tell you. I want you to duck down below the window level and stay there until I say it's safe. My heart started pounding so hard I could hear it in my ears. Are we in danger? I whispered. But before he could answer, sir, the black sedan pulled up alongside our bus. The windows were so dark I couldn't see inside, but I felt like someone was staring right at me. Mister Bax's hand moved to something under his dashboard that looked like a panic button. Everyone sit down and be quiet, he announced to the whole bus in his serious voice. The car kept pace with us as we started moving again. Staying right next to my window, I pressed myself against the seat, trying to make myself smaller. Other kids were craning their necks to see what was happening, but something about the Whole situation felt wrong in a way I couldn't explain. My phone finally rang and it was my mom, but she sounded weird, really weird. Tip, honey, where are you right now? Her voice was shaky like she'd been crying. I'm on the bus. We're running late because she cut me off. Listen to me very carefully. Do not come home today. Go to Aunt Pip's house instead. I'll pick you up there later. In the background, I could hear men's voices talking, but I couldn't make out what they were saying. Mom, what's wrong? Why can't I come home? The line went quiet for a few seconds. Then she whispered, just trust me, baby, don't come to the house. Paul ended abruptly, leaving me staring at my phone in panic. Mr Bax was watching me in the rearview mirror. What did she say? I told him about going to my aunt's house instead. And his face got this grim expression. The black car was still following us and now there was a second one behind it. Change of plans, kid. We're going straight to the police station. He made a sharp turn away from.

I need extra hands. Yeah, I don't think so. I wasn't about to climb into a bathroom stall with a freak. No, please. I think I might bleed out. Her voice was shaking. And suddenly this wasn't funny anymore. It was summer from my English class, a pregnant senior who everyone whispered about but nobody really talked to. She was sitting on the toilet, gripping the handicap rail with white knuckles, and her face was covered in sweat. What's wrong? I asked, even though I was starting to guess. Please do something. I'm giving birth. She looked up at me with pure terror in her eyes. My whole body went cold. I was 17 and barely knew how tampons worked, let alone babies. But she was crying and alone, and I couldn't just leave her there. I hopped over the stall divider awkwardly and almost slipped on the wet floor. That's when I saw it. The baby was already crowning. There was blood on the toilet seat and the floor, and summer was making these low groaning sounds that scared me more than anything. This was actually happening in a gross school bathroom with fluorescent lights and graffiti on the walls. I'll be right back. I ran out of the bathroom. Still in shock. I sprinted down the hallway to Missus Bishar's classroom. She was my favourite teacher and The only adult I could think of who wouldn't freak out, I burst through her door, interrupting her lecture on photosynthesis. The whole class stared at me. I need your help urgently, please. I was out of breath and probably looked insane. Missus Bashar took one look at my face and followed me without asking questions. We ran back to the bathroom and I could hear summer sounds getting louder. Other kids were starting to peek out of classrooms wondering what was happening. Missus Bishar pushed open the stall door and immediately went into teacher mode. Okay, honey, I'm here. You're doing great. I'm going to support you while she gets the nurse. I didn't need to be told twice. I ran to the nurse's office faster than I'd ever run in PE. When I burst through the door, Nurse Patty was checking Casey's temperature. Casey, who everyone knew was Summer's boyfriend, the guy who'd been bragging about becoming a dad at prom. Summer's having her baby in the bathroom right now. I basically screamed it. Casey's face went from white to green. He threw up all over the floor before Nurse Patty could grab a trash can. But we didn't have time to deal with that. Three of us ran back to the bathroom with nurse Patty grabbing emergency supplies from her cabinet. By now, half the school had heard something was happening. Kids were crowding outside the bathroom doors trying to figure out what all the screaming was. About teachers were trying to move them back to class, but nobody was listening. When we got back to the stall, it was chaos. Missus Bashar was holding Summer's hand while she pushed. The nurse immediately took over, checking how dilated she was and telling summer to breathe. Casey stood frozen in the doorway looking like he might pass out. That's when summer grabbed my hand and pulled me close. You have to get.

Girl, when I tell you, I almost fainted when the school called me. I ain't even playing. So it's a regular Thursday. I'm in the middle of target looking for a throw pillow that matches absolutely nothing. And my phone rings. Caller ID says Lincoln Elementary. My stomach drop. I thought, oh, god, did she fall off the monkey bars again? Did she hit someone? Or worse, did she say something? Think she heard me say? So I answer all fake sweet, like, hi, this is her mom. And the lady on the other end says, ma'am, we need you to come in immediately. Your daughter had an incident. Now listen, my daughter Layla is cute, like real cute. Big eyes, big hair, big attitude. She's eight, but she's also part gremlin when she's hungry or bored. So I throw the pillows back, leave the car and speed down to that school like it's the Indie 500. I walk in, heart pounding, and the secretary just points at the principal's office like, yeah, she's in there. I open the door and baby Layla sitting there with her arms crossed like a little mob boss. Principal looking nervous. There's a boy across from her with an ice pack on his head and a teacher looking like she aged 10 years today. I go, Layla, what did you do? She goes, he tried to take my cookie. So I defended myself. Calm like she's In court, the principal sighs and says she hit him with a lunch tray. I blinked. I'm sorry. She what? Now the teacher jumps in. She told the boy, touch it and you lose a finger. We thought she was joking. Next thing we know, he grabs her cookie and boom, metal tray to the forehead. I had to bite the inside of my cheek to keep from laughing because I know where she got that line, me. She got it from me. I said that last week about my fries at Chili's. But I clear my throat and say, Layla, you can't go around hitting people. He goes, he tried to rob me. What was I supposed to do care? Like it's a fairy tale. That cookie had my name on it in Sharpie. I wrote it. Possession is 9/10 of the law, y'all. She hit him with legal terms. The boy starts sniffling like he's the victim here. And Layla leans in and says, you should have asked. Now look at you. I stocked up like leftovers. I had to turn around and pretend to cough so I wouldn't laugh. I'm dying inside. The principal says, we don't condone violence. Layla goes, neither do I, but I condone consequences. I swear, this child is either gonna be a lawyer or in jail. So I take her home, try to give her a serious talk. I go, he can't be violent, even if you're right. There's rules. She goes, Exactly. Rule No. 1, don't touch my food. I said, Layla, I'm serious. She goes, okay, okay. Next time I'll use words. Maybe. Probably. And then y'all ready for the kicker? That night, I get a text from the mom of the boy. I'm bracing myself.

The call came through my commanding officer. Your son committed felony assault at his father's wedding. You need to get home now. I was on a base in Germany and hadn't seen my boys in 8 months. Now my teenage son who stopped wrestling because he hated hurting people was facing charges for brutalizing a woman at the altar. After an 18 hour emergency flight, I, I headed to my ex husband's house where my son was. The wife's dark blood was still stained by the driveway. I rang the doorbell. My ex husband Conrad answered. His face twisted with rage. We're pressing charges. I'm not taking anyone's side until I see both, I said. Pushing past him. The living room was a tribunal. Conrad's parents on the couch, his brother Potter by the fireplace, his sister Fenn in the corner, the bride's parents standing like guard dogs. And in the center the bride Lauren with a splinted nose, two black eyes, bandages across her face. She he was crying, dabbing her eyes carefully around the swelling. And there surrounded by this mob sat my son, my 14 year old who refused to kill insects because he could have been born an ant, who taught his little stepbrother origami. He sat perfectly straight, chin raised, looking me dead in the eyes with zero regret. He looked proud of what he Did your son destroyed our family, Conrad spat. Look what he did to her face. Lauren sobbed harder. He's an animal. They're trying him as an adult, right? Grandpa shook his head in disgust. I looked at my son. His knuckles were still bruised and swollen. There seemed to be no real excuse. But then I asked for his side of the story. He looked around the room slowly taking in every face. Then he spoke. Voice clear. You wanna know the truth? She's been molesting me for 6 months. That's why I did it. My world stopped, but the room exploded instantly. Liar. Disgusting. How dare you. Lauren's face shifted for just a sec and before she wailed louder. He's making it up. I've been nothing but loving. Her mother stepped forward pointing at my son. You evil little. But her father grabbed her arm, his face pale like he'd been expecting this. In the midst of all the chaos, my son pulled out his phone and swiped to his hidden photos, she said. Fourteen year old boys always want it said. I should be grateful. I saw the images over his shoulder and my stomach turned. Conrad's hands were shaking as he stared at the screen. Those could be anyone could have, but his voice was hollow like he was reading a script. He didn't believe Lauren tried to snatch the phone. Those are out of context. I, it was just she stopped realizing. She just admitted they Were real. My son stood up, voice shaking with rage. Dad, I told you three months ago, you said she's just being affectionate. Conrad started stuttering. I didn't. I thought, Grandpa, you laughed. Lucky boy. Wish I had that problem at 14. Grandpa's face went from red to white. He looked at Lauren, then at his grandson, and something crumbled in his expression. Aunt Fenn, you told me, don't be dramatic. Fenn was backing toward the door, tears streaming. Oh, god. Oh, god. I thought you were just Uncle Potter. You said I should be grateful Potter had his head in his hands. Jesus Christ. I was joking. I didn't know she was actually grandma. You said boys can't be great by women. Grandma collapsed into the couch, rosary beads in her hands, whispering prayers. Every single one of you told me to shut up about it. Lauren's parents were having a whispered argument. Her father hissed. Not again, Patricia. You said she was better. The word again hung in the air. But that's not why I hit her. My son cut through. Everyone immediately froze. What do you.

Yeah, bro. I just had the worst couple days of my life. What? Why? What happened? You know that new diet I've been on, right? Uh, yeah, I heard that eating fiber helps you lose weight. So I got five boxes of those Fiber one bars. That's all I've been eating. Nothing else, just fiber bars. I couldn't. The day after that I did the same thing. I ate six more boxes of fiber bars, only I didn't that day either. I was getting very worried. I take at least one on a normal day, but I could feel the fat burning off my body from all the fiber. I didn't. The day after that either. I didn't. The fourth day I didn't. Fifth day I didn't. The sixth day, but then I was drinking my morning coffee and I started hearing the loudest rumble I've ever heard. I thought it was an earthquake or volcano exploding, but no, it was my stomach. I rushed to the toilet. The moment my ass hits the toilet, the loudest and most funkiest fart comes out of my. Took 8 seconds for the fart to finish. My mom rushed to the bathroom door. She thought something happened to me. Then it stops. A brick starts to come out and it's so solid that I feel like I'm giving birth to Megamind out of my ass. I hung on to the shower curtain and I prayed. I ripped the Whole shower curtain out of the wall. Then the brick finally came out. At speeds faster than a F1 racing car, the entire bathroom was soaking in toilet water. That's just the start. A fart that could do more damage than a nuclear missile starts a barrage of bullets from me. After an hour, it seemed to be over. I'm crying at this point and I can barely breathe. I wipe my butt crystal clean. What the actual.

He even attached his resume like we were best buddies. I had to read it three times because I couldn't believe the audacity. This dude, who wouldn't even acknowledge my existence, was now trying to use my name and position to get himself a job at my company. I immediately went to LinkedIn to do some detective work. His profile showed he'd been unemployed for six months. Before that, he'd only lasted 8 months at his previous job. The guy was clearly desperate. My first instinct was to just ignore the email completely, let him figure out on his own that I wasn't gonna help. But the more I thought about it, the more annoyed I got. He was literally trying to use me after making it crystal clear we weren't friends anymore. So I picked up my phone and called our HR director, Janet. I told her the whole story. This guy was someone from my past who'd made it very clear he wanted nothing to do with me, and now he was trying to use my name as a reference without even asking permission first. Janet was shocked. She said that was pretty bold of him and asked if I wanted her to make a note in his file. I said absolutely, but I wasn't done. I also went to talk to Marcus, one of the partners who handles hiring for Tyler's department. I told him the whole story about the divorce, the friend group split, and especially about Tyler's behavior at that charity event. Marcus actually laughed and said he couldn't believe someone would be that clueless. Marcus told me Tyler's application was already pretty weak anyway. His resume had some gaps and his cover letter was generic as hell. But now, knowing he was the type of person to burn bridges and then try to use those same bridges later, that sealed the deal. Tyler never even got a phone screening, let alone an actual interview. His application went straight to the rejection pile. About a week later, I got another email from him asking if I'd gotten his first message and if there was anything else he could provide to help with the reference. The man was still clueless. I finally replied with the shortest message possible. Hi Tyler, I received your email. I won't be able to provide a reference. Best of luck with your job search! He never responded, which was probably for the best.

She ranted for 30 minutes straight about how unfair it was that I got pregnant first. She pointed at me like I was the villain. Then she yelled, if she doesn't end it, I'm done with all of you. Uncle Liam, who's a lawyer, just shook his head and said, Serena, there's literally no law that says your sister has to abort, so you can go first. She burst into tears.

Missus Foster, the school nurse, started getting suspicious because Caitlin's episodes only happened during big moments. Never during Boring Tuesday afternoon history class or anything. Always during assemblies or after someone else got good news. Final straw was during our spring talent show. This girl, Aaliyah, had been practicing violin for months. She was actually really good, too. Like, competition level good. Everyone was excited to hear her play because she'd been posting practice videos, and they were amazing. So Aaliyah gets on stage, spotlight hits her. She raises her violin, and right as she's about to start playing, Caitlin screams from the audience and drops to the floor like a sack of potatoes. Her eyes are rolling back, she's twitching, the whole nine yards. Everyone panics. Teachers are running over. Someone called 9 1 1. Aaliyah just stood there on stage, looking confused, while everyone ignored her. To help Caitlin. The whole show stopped. Parents in the audience were recording Caitlin instead of their own kids performing. The paramedics showed up and took Caitlin backstage to check her out. I was helping clean up chairs so I could hear everything through the curtain. They're checking her pulse, her breathing, asking her questions, but she's not responding. Just lying there with her eyes closed, looking all peaceful. Then I heard one of the paramedics whisper something to his partner, something about her vital signs. Being totally normal. Her pulse was steady, her breathing was calm. When they'd shine a light in her eyes, her pupils reacted fine. And when they asked her questions, her eyelids would twitch, like she was listening but trying not to respond. That's when the older paramedic leaned down and whispered in her ear. I couldn't hear what he said at first, but then he said it louder. If you don't wake up in the next 10 seconds, we're gonna have to insert a cap to check for internal injuries. Caitlin sat up so fast, she almost gave herself whiplash. Her eyes were wide open, and she was looking around like she just woke up from a nap. What? Where am I? What happened? All innocent and confused, but it was too late. Half the backstage crew heard what the paramedics said. The story spread through school faster than wildfire. By Monday morning, everyone knew Caitlin had been faking her medical emergencies. Her parents pulled her out of school a month later and enrolled her somewhere across town.

So Caitlin was one of those girls who always needed to be the centre of everything. If someone else got picked for class president, suddenly she'd have some dramatic emergency. If her crush was talking to another girl, boom! She'd start crying about her dead grandma or something. But the weirdest thing was how the fire alarm kept going off at our school. Like, literally every other week. The principal thought it was broken or something, but it always happened at the most random times. During Pep rallies, when other people were getting cheered for, during talent shows, when someone else was performing, during lunch, when people were talking about how cool someone else was. Nobody connected it to Caitlin at first, because she was always right there looking shocked like everyone else. She'd even tweet about how annoying the fire drills were. Real Academy Award stuff. But then Mister Jenkins, our janitor, found something weird behind the art wing. A pencil jammed into one of the fire alarms. Not just any pencil, though. This thing had KM carved into it. Caitlin Martinez. He tried saying someone stole her pencil and framed her, but come on, who steals pencils just to frame someone? Word got around fast. People started calling her fire girl behind her back. You'd think she'd chill out after that, right? Wrong. She just switched tactics. Suddenly, Caitlin had every medical condition you could think of. One week, she Was having seizures in the middle of English class. Next week, she was having panic attacks during math tests. She'd collapse in the hallway, and everyone would freak out and call the nurse. The thing is, her timing was suspicious as hell. She only had these episodes when something good was happening to someone else. Like when this girl Ashley got asked to prom by the hot senior. Caitlin. Had a fainting spell right in front of their lockers.

So I told her she can toss her invite in the trash because I won't beg her to be there. Mark was my mom's baby boy and she didn't do much to hide it. If my sisters and I got gifts, they were for us to share. But my mom made it clear that Mark's things were only for him and we weren't allowed to touch them. When Mark screwed up, I get punished for not being a good role model. For example, when Mark went through a phase of breaking his toys, I got the beating because obviously he Learned that behavior from me. It was around this time that I started distancing myself from my brother. I got my first job when I turned 17 because I wanted to finally get my car and make money. Couldn't force me to give to Mark. I got my first car at 18 after all my hard work. When Mark wanted my parents to buy him a car, my mom told me to give him mine because he needed it more. When I refused, she threatened to kick me out. At the start of the new school year, I moved away from college and cut contact with them. Later when I moved back, my sister told me they had been seeing a family therapist and that my parents wanted to apologize for their Treatment of us. I was hesitant but agreed as long as they were genuine. And the reconciliation process began when I moved back home. Then I met Jen. We met at a bar in October soon after I returned and we hit it off immediately. She was by far the most beautiful and intelligent woman I'd ever met. And after a few dates, we made it official. I wasn't sure where our relationship or my reconciled family ties were headed, so I kept details of my family to myself, ready to cut contact again if needed. At a family dinner, my parents asked to see pictures of my girlfriend and passed my phone around. When Mark saw them, he exploded, calling me a shitty brother for dating his ex, demanded I break it off with her. I refused. Later, Jen confirmed they had dated briefly, only for about a month before he lost interest, claiming he was bored of relationships and never wanted to settle down. On Jen's birthday, I took her to a fancy dinner with both families and her closest friends to ask her to marry me. Mark again flipped out about my proposal, though my sisters and I quickly shut down his outburst. For two months, Mark had been mostly quiet, so I didn't think much of it until he unexpectedly invited Jen and me to a family dinner at his apartment tended by my parents and sisters. Though I found the invitation odd, I agreed to Go. During that dinner, after a modest meal, we moved to the living room. About 30 minutes in, Mark stood up and announced he had something important to say. He gave a lengthy speech about his happiness, then, to everyone's shock, got on one knee, pulled out a cheap ring and proposed to Jen. Confused and uncomfortable, Jen demanded he stop immediately. My dad tried to intervene, but I punched him before he could do more, Mark muttered.

That was the final straw. Jen and I went home and decided to uninvite him from the wedding. A few days later, my mom stopped by to discuss my wedding. She asked why I was so adamant about not inviting Mark. She insisted I wasn't overreacting about his past relationship with Jen and accused me of ostracizing her son. She warned that if I didn't re invite him, she wouldn't come either. I shrugged and told her that if that's what she wanted, she could toss her invite in the trash. I wasn't going to beg her to attend. When she asked if I'd be okay with her not coming, I replied that it wouldn't be the first time she missed an event because of Mark raged. She called me an a H for throwing her past mistakes in my face and stormed out. About two weeks later, my mom returned to clear the air. She couldn't understand why I wouldn't overlook what I considered a simple mistake, proposing to my fiance with me sitting less than 3 feet away. She claimed it was just a joke. The argument quickly escalated into a screaming match. As Jen headed for the door, my mom chased after her, still yelling that I was tearing our family apart. While Jen unlocked the door, my mom grabbed her hair, pulled her down and continued screaming. She hit Jen. And tried clawing her face. I dragged her off and threw her outside. She pounded on the door for several minutes while I ensured Jen was safe. Once I was sure Jen was okay, I texted my mom telling her not to reach out again because we'd never speak to her. Even though Jen wasn't interested in further reconciliation, our decision was final. After that, I was shocked when my mom tried to corner me leaving my job and screamed at me about trying to ruin her life. She kept screaming that I was an awful son for trying to get her arrested over a small misunderstanding and she didn't understand what she done to deserve being punished like this. I told her that she shouldn't have hit Jen if she didn't like being in legal trouble. She demanded that I tell the police to forget the report, which I refused. I told her what the officer said about it being out of my hands. I also told her that I would never forgive her for what she did to Jen and what she did to me and my sisters growing up. She started to say how I should move on like my sisters, but I cut her off and told her that she should take their forgiveness and move on because she would never receive it from me.

You're doing this on purpose. Those were the first words my mother said when my water broke at her Christmas dinner table. Not, are you okay? Not let's get you to the hospital. She actually accused me of timing my contractions to steal her spotlight. The whole family just sat there, forks suspended midway to their mouth as amniotic fluid pulled on her precious Persian rug. My sister Jessica filmed it not to capture the moment her nephew was about to be born, but to post on her story with crying, laughing emojis. Emily's water just broke and ruined Mom's five thousand dollar rug. Dead! My father didn't even look up from carving the Turkey. Can't you hold it in for a few hours? We haven't even opened presents yet. Hold it in like my son. Was a sneeze I could suppress. My husband David practically carried me to the car while my mother shouted from the doorway, the hospital is 40 minutes away! You'll miss everything! This dinner cost me three days of cooking. Our son, Oliver was born at 11:47 p m. On Christmas Eve. Seven pounds of perfect, screaming life. While David and I cried tears of joy, my phone buzzed with a group text from my family's chat. Since Emily decided to be dramatic, we're starting a new tradition. Christmas dinner is now adults only. No exceptions. They meant Oliver. My hours Old baby was already banned from family Christmas. I thought they'd soften when they met him on his first birthday. We tried to merge the Celebration. Big mistake. My mother bought a cake for Jesus. It's his birthday. We're supposed to celebrate, she announced, placing it at center table, while Oliver's Mickey Mouse cake sat ignored in the corner. When Oliver reached for a piece, she slapped his tiny hand. That's not for attention seekers. He was one year old. Year 2 was worse. My parents sent a card, not to Oliver, but to us. Inside was a Bill for the rug Emily destroyed. $5,000 for the catering that went to waste. $2,000 for emotional distress. Priceless. Consider this Oliver's inheritance. By year three, they'd recruited, extend, did family. Oliver's cousins got mountains of Christmas presents while he got one. A book titled Children Who Ruined Christmas that my sister Jessica had custom printed. She thought it was hilarious. Oliver couldn't read yet, but he understood. He was different. Why does grandma love Kaylee more than me? He asked. Bailey was born in July. The final straw came on Oliver's fifth birthday. My mother had been suspiciously sweet, insisting on hosting. I should have known. We arrived to find a funeral wreath on the door. What's this? I asked. Oh, my mother said casually, it's a memorial for the Christmas that died when Oliver was born.

So I made her watch him fall for me instead. My twin sister, Emma, has been obsessed with our neighbor Lucas since we were 14. Not a cute crush. I'm talking shrine in her closet, tracking his location obsessed. He gently rejected her junior year. She snapped. Her new mission became ensuring nobody else could be happy in love. Especially me. It started with psychological warfare. She'd befriend my boyfriends, then slowly poison them against me. With Marcus, she'd casually mention how I used to have commitment issues. With David, she planted my diary, conveniently open to old entries about crushes where he'd find it. But Tyler was her masterpiece of destruction. We've been together 18 months. Ring shopping. Emma played the supportive sister perfectly. Even helped me pick out an apartment. Then one night, she invited Tyler over while I was at work. She drugged his drink. Not enough to knock him out, just enough to make him dizzy and confused. And she stripped down to her underwear, climbed into his lap, and started taking selfies. When I came home early with takeout to surprise him, I found them like that. Tyler was barely conscious, pushing her away slow during what's happening. But those photos, they looked damning. Emma had already sent them to my phone with the message, I'm so sorry you had to find out this way. Even when Tyler's drug test came back Positive. Even with Emma's search history showing she'd researched benzos that leave the system quickly, people still wondered. The doubt killed us. We broke up two months later. When I confronted Emma, she was doing a face mask, completely calm. She said, Lucas will never love anyone, so why should you get a fairy tale? At least we're even now.

She'll literally corner me by the kitchen sink and be like, just give me a hint, honey. I promise I won't tell anyone.

And for a girl, it's between Brunilda, Bertha or Methuzelah. Kyle nearly choked on his iced tea. Janet's face went completely white.

That's false testimony. The entire courtroom goes silent. Officer Johnson's eyes starts twitching. Tyler, that's not how objections work. Then how do they work? Because nobody explained the rules, and I don't want to accidentally break more laws. Officer Johnson continues. The defendant caused $200 in property damage and showed no remorse when arrested. Tyler raises his hand again. That's also incorrect, your honor. What now? I showed plenty of remorse. I said sorry when Officer Johnson tackled me. I also said, ow and get off me, you're heavy, which shows genuine emotion. Officer Johnson jumps in. You also said, this is stupid and math still sucks.

Judge Williams is openly laughing now. Tyler, what's your response to 40 hours of community service? Your honor, that's cruel and unusual punishment. It only took me 10 minutes to create my masterpiece, so why should only owe 10 minutes of community service? That's not how it works. Then math is even more useless than I thought. Also, why should I pay $200? My graffiti increased the property value by adding character. Officer Johnson can't take it anymore, your honor. He thinks he improved the school. Tyler nodded seriously. Officer Johnson, before my artwork, that wall was Just boring brick. Now it's a conversation starter. You vandalized public property. I enhanced public property. There's a difference. Judge Williams makes his decision. Tyler, I'm sentencing you to 20 hours of community service and $200 restitution. Your honor, can I appeal this decision? On what grounds? Temporary insanity caused by prolonged exposure to quadratic equations. Also, I think Officer Johnson has a personal vendetta against artistic expression. That's not a real legal defense. Should be. I have nightmares about the Pythagorean theorem. As we're wrapping up, Tyler asks, your honor, can I get a copy of the transcript? Why? I want to use it for my college application essay.

What made our friends angry was how he'd show up to everything. Free park, basketball, he'd be there. Beach day, first one with his towel. Laid out. House parties, never missed one. He's mooching off of us. George said, have you noticed how he'd always bring his own snacks when he went out with us instead of chipping in for pizza? I'm telling you, he skips things that cost money. And when he does show up to the free stuff, he doesn't spend money on anything, even if it's for the whole group. I suggested maybe he just wasn't hungry for pizza, that maybe we were all just overthinking things. But the next time it happened, our friends absolutely lost it. We had one simple plan for our friend Reggie's birthday party. Order pizza, wings and cake. Make it happen. Each person had to pitch in $15. Reggie kept saying he didn't want anything big, but we could tell he was excited to have everyone together. But when it came time to collect money, Russell just smiled and pulled, got a homemade Birthday card instead, not a fancy one either, but a printer paper folded in half with handmade drawings and a happy birthday, Reggie written in pen on the front. Bob grabbed the card and ripped it in half, his face fuming with anger. Are you serious? Right now we're all throwing in for your friend's birthday and you bring in a card and chips from home just so you don't have to pay, he yelled. You always use Reggie's Xbox account. You swim in his pool, eat his food every time we're here, and you can't even cough up 15 bucks for his birthday? What's wrong with you, George added. And soon everyone was blowing up in his face, calling him all sorts of names. Russell tried to speak back and, but no one was listening. He looked at me with tears filling his eyes before running off. I frowned. That was too harsh. I know you guys are angry, but that wasn't right, I told them. I left the party and rushed out, trying to chase after him towards the direction of his house. I saw him stop by the elementary school playground about halfway to his house and sat on the swings in the rain just staring out at nothing. Before I could call out to him, his phone rang. Looked at it for a second, then put it on speaker and set it on his lap. Hey, mom, he said. The rain hiding his shaky voice. Russell Honey, I'm so sorry, his mom said frantically. I have to work another double. I know. I promised I'd be home tonight. He pressed his lips together. It's okay.

Someone was forcing her to send these messages, and she was using our childhood code to tell me she'd been kidnapped. I kept replying, trying to subtly tell her that I understood what she was saying without tipping off anyone else reading her texts, but I wasn't sure it was working. The final text came at 2:00am and made my heart stop. I'm having such a peaceful time here. I said hi to 47 people, and it reminded me of how we used to play pirates. My mom would love the cookies they serve. The purple flowers here are so beautiful. And I spend all day at the library reading. This is exactly what I needed. Every single code word was in that message. Danger. Help me. And she'd given me a location. High to 47. Highway 47. And we used to play pirates at Whitman Creek. I didn't call the police because I knew they'd think I was crazy talking about a secret code. Instead, I grabbed my dad's hunting rifle and drove two hours to Whitman Creek. I parked down the road and crept through the woods until I found a rundown cabin. There was Calla tied to a chair in the living room, with a man I'd never seen before pacing around her. I called 9 1 1 from the woods and told them there was an armed kidnapper at the cabin. The police surrounded the place 20 minutes later, and Took Calla back and captured the kidnapper. Calla was shaking like she used to during thunderstorms when we were kids, but she was alive. The kidnapper was some creep named Jack who'd been stalking Calla for months. He grabbed her from her apartment parking garage and forced her to send those messages to keep people from searching. What he didn't know was that Calla had been leaving me a bread crumb trail the entire time. During the arrest, Jack kept ranting. How was I supposed to know she was talking in some kind of secret language? Where do girls come up with this crap? Callus spent three days in the hospital. She's going to be okay. When I visited her, the first thing she said was, I can't believe you remembered our stupid spy code. I told her it wasn't stupid. It saved her life. She laughed and said, well, I guess all those years of pretending to be secret agents finally paid off. We don't use the code for silly things anymore. But we did both teach it to our daughters. Because you never know when you might need to scream for help in the quietest way possible.

I bought him a gaming chair, but labeled it an ergonomic study chair to maintain the charade. The turning point came when I overheard him on the phone with his friend. I feel bad lying to my parents, he said, but they'd never understand. Dad would probably just lecture me about wasting time on games. That hit hard. Here was my son building something impressive. Afraid I wouldn't understand. So I devised a plan. I created an anonymous account and became his biggest supporter, always first to comment on videos. I'd leave detailed feedback just like I wished I could do in person. He started mentioning this mysterious viewer in his videos, grateful for their support. Then came his biggest video yet, hitting 1 million subscribers. He went live to celebrate and that's when I dropped the bomb. I donated $500 with the message, Congratulations, son. Next time you need better lighting for studying, just ask love dad. The stream went silent. He just stared at the screen, mouth open. Then in front of a million subscribers, my quiet, reserved son broke down crying. Dad's been watching this whole time, he whispered. I I heard him run upstairs to my office. When he burst in still crying, I spun around in my chair wearing his merchandise, a T-shirt with his channel logo I'd secretly ordered weeks ago. We should probably talk about that 300 dollar microphone now, I said. Grinning, he launched Himself at me for a hug, then froze. Wait, all those noise interruptions, the soundproofing suggestions, that was all you? Of course I laughed. You think I couldn't hear you raging about dying to millenia at 3 a. M. I raised you. I know what gamer rage sounds like. Now he streams from a proper setup in his room. No more sneaking around. Last week, he hit 2 million subscribers. That 300 dollar microphone receipt that started it all, I had it framed. It hangs above his setup, signed by both of us. Best investment ever.

My 14 year old son thinks he's a master of deception, but he has no idea I know about his secret YouTube channel. I discovered it by accident when I was cleaning his room and found a crumpled receipt for a 300 dollar microphone. At first I was furious. We just had a talk about responsible spending. But before confronting him, I decided to do some digging. That night after he went to bed, I searched his browser history. There it was, a gaming channel with 50,000 subscribers. My quiet, introverted son, who barely i spoke at family dinners was absolutely electric on camera, cracking jokes and entertaining thousands. Instead of shutting it down, i decided to play dumb and secretly support him. Every time he went to study at the library, i knew he was actually recording videos in our basement. I'd intentionally make extra noise upstairs so he'd have to re-record, teaching him patience. He complained about background noise ruining his takes. I suggested soundproofing his room for better concentration while studying. He started asking for odd things, green poster board, ring lights, a better webcam. Each time I'd make him present a detailed plan for how these school supplies would improve his grades. His presentations got increasingly elaborate. He even made a Powerpoint about how better lighting would help him read text books more clearly. The best part, every time he uploaded a new video, I'd watch It immediately, my son would sit at dinner casually mentioning how hard his homework was while I knew he just spent three hours trying to beat the final boss in Elden Ring. He got creative with his excuses. Once he told us he needed to join the debate club to improve his public speaking. In reality, he was practicing his commentary skills. When he won most improved speaker at school, I had to bite my tongue. His hundreds of hours of gaming commentary had given him more confidence than any debate club could. One day he mentioned needing a new chair because his back hurt from studying. I knew the real reason.

My best friend Calla and I created a secret code when we were 8 years old because we thought we were super spies. We'd replace certain words with seemingly innocent phrases that meant something completely different. Purple flowers meant danger. Going to the library meant help me. My mom made cookies meant I'm scared. We used it throughout middle school and high school, mostly for stupid stuff like getting out of awkward date or signalling when we needed backup at parties. By college, we pretty much forgotten about it, but old habits die hard and sometimes we'd still slip coded phrases into our conversations without thinking about it. When Callah's text started coming in one day, everything seemed normal at first. Hey, Amanda, I've been thinking a lot lately and I've decided to take some time for myself. I'm leaving town for a while and I don't want anyone to worry about me or try to find me. I just need space to figure things out. Tell my parents I'm safe, but I won't be in contact for a while. It sounded like Calla, but something felt off. She'd been planning her sister's wedding for months and would never just disappear without a word. Plus, Calla never used the phrase figure things out because she said it was basic white girl speak. The text kept coming over the next few days, each one more persistent. I know you're probably confused, but this Is what I need right now. Please don't let anyone look for me. I'm exploring new opportunities and meeting new people. Some days I feel like I'm in a completely different world. That's when my blood ran cold. Different world was part of our old code. It meant not safe. I read the message again and suddenly other phrases jumped out at me. New opportunities was code for trap. Meeting new people meant stranger danger. I started analyzing every text she'd sent. Staying at this really cute place with purple flowers everywhere appeared. In the third message, purple flowers meant danger. I've been spending a lot of time at the library. Here was in the fifth message. Library meant help me. My hands were shaking as.

After giving up, I returned to my room and looked through our old drawing book we worked on together, reminding myself of why I loved my brother so much growing up. To my surprise, two of the pages in the book had tiny folded notes addressed to me saying terrible things about my dad. Each note explained gruesome details about how my dad hit my brother or punished him through starvation or tied him up outside to a tree. I covered my mouth from shock and frantically searched around my room for more clues from our old toys. The last note I found asked me to call the police he thought that my dad was going to do something unspeakable to him soon. My, my heart raced just thinking about what had actually happened to my brother. I brought all of the notes I found to class the following day and stopped by the police station in my free time. I begged them to reopen my brother's case and submitted all the evidence as well as my personal testimony. I asked them to bring in my brother's old friends who we're also aware of the things that have been going on between my brother and my father. With enough statements, the police escorted me home and arrested my father. The moment he got home at this station, it was revealed that my dad had Really beaten my brother and hid him in the tree. The week he went missing, my father made sure to remove all notes from my brother's room, but never bothered checking mine. Hearing his confession at the station made me sick to my stomach. I couldn't believe I was living with a man who could hurt a family member in the most horrific ways imaginable. I. I moved out of the house that same day and moved into my mom's house. This year, my dad has a chance for Parole, but I plan on fighting it for both me and my older brother.

I was always told that my older brother ran away with his friends, but it never really made sense because I still saw his friends around town. I remember the first time I heard about him running away. It was around 1987 and I was about 8 years old. My father told me over dinner that my brother had left home while I was away at school that day, told me not to look for him. I felt really sad because I really loved watching television with him and riding our bikes together. And for him to leave without saying goodbye, it really hurt my heart. While I rolled around the peas with my fork, I asked my dad when my brother would be coming back. My Dad's expression turned grim as he told me that my brother would most likely never return. That broke my heart even more. The following day, I saw my dad cutting down my brother's favorite tree in the backyard. I tried to run out and stop him, but my dad told me that he needed to remove the tree so that he could send it to my brother. That was another thing that never made sense to me, but I accepted it as a kid. Days turned into weeks and weeks into years. It had been 10 years since my older brother ran away. I was ready to Finally accept the fact that I would never see him again until I saw his best friend enter the grocery store I worked at and saw my chance at closure. I approached him casually and asked if my brother lived with him or contacted him. The friend gave a weirded out look and explained that none of my friends had seen him for over a decade. I asked if they knew where my brother had run off to and they said that he never ran off anywhere. I tried to push for more information, but my father walked into the store looking for me. I apologized to the friend and walked off to help my dad out. Later that.

Month 3, my Japanese was finally good enough to have actual real conversations beyond ordering food. That's when I met Yuki at a language exchange meet up in a tiny cafe tucked away in Harajuku. I was studying international business at Waseda University, spoke absolutely perfect English and had this incredibly infectious laugh that made my chest feel tight. We started meeting twice a week to practice languages, but really we were just falling head over heels for each other. One random Thursday morning while Yuki and I were sharing convenience store coffee and those weird fluffy pancakes, my phone absolutely exploded with notification after notification. I made a huge mistake. I miss us so much. It hurts. This break was the stupidest idea ever. Can you please come home? I need you back in my life. Then another message I saw Jake post about Japan on his story. Are you seriously teaching little kids now? This whole thing is ridiculous. And another answer, me right now. We need to talk about this properly. You can't just ignore me forever. I screenshot all the messages and showed them to Yuki who read through them carefully with raised eyebrows, then burst out laughing so hard she nearly spit out her coffee. Tell her you found someone who doesn't need breaks to figure out what she wants, he said. In perfect English, playfully stealing a bite of my pancake with her chopsticks. So I sent back exactly that. I found someone who doesn't need breaks to know what she wants. Hope you eventually find what you're looking for. Lisa's response came back within literally two minutes. Pan was always a completely stupid idea anyway. You're throwing your entire life away for some ridiculous fantasy that won't last. I showed Yuki the bitter message. She just smiled sweetly and said, should we tell her about our engagement party next month? We both started laughing so hard, the convenience store clerk started giving us really weird looks. Definitely the best break of my entire life.

She seemed fine with it at the time. Yet here we were the night before my party and she'd forgotten that crucial detail. I typed back, sorry, Ellen, no kids allowed. Remember what happened last year? My apartment still hasn't recovered. Her response appeared instantly. They were just being children. Besides, I already bought their costumes and told them they're going to Aunt Katie's spooky party. You wouldn't disappoint kids on Halloween, would you? That's just cruel. Actually, I would. And I wasn't about to let emotional manipulation ruin another Halloween. Instead of arguing further, I had a better idea. My neighbor, Mike, works as a professional clown for children's parties. But here's the thing about Mike. He's 6 4, covered in tattoos and has this naturally intense stare. Kids are terrified of him. Despite his best efforts to be friendly, I called Mike and explained my situation. He laughed and agreed to help for $200 and unlimited access to my Halloween punch. Next evening, as my adult guests began arriving, Mike took up his position on my front porch. He wore his standard clown costume but with blood splatters added to his white makeup and carried a sign that read, adults only party. Children will be entertained by me on the porch. At exactly seven thirty PM, Ellen's minivan pulled into my driveway. I watched through the window as she parked and started unloading her vampire twins. Then she spotted Mike sitting eerily still on my Porch swing, slowly twisting a balloon animal while staring directly at her car. The look on her face was priceless. She frantically rolled up the car windows and locked the doors. The twins were pressing their faces against the glass, their vampire makeup now streaked with tears. Ellen reversed so quickly she knocked over my mailbox in her escape. My phone lit up with a furious text. What kind of sick joke is this? I simply replied, adults only means adults only. Enjoy your evening. The party was perfect. No broken heirlooms, no emergency vet visits and not a single fish was harmed. Mike turned out to be the hit of the party. He makes incredible balloon martini glasses. Ellen hasn't spoken to me since, but several family members have thanked me privately. Apparently, I'm not the first victim of her. Kids will be kids parenting style.

I replied, I understand. What she didn't know was that I've been planning to propose next week. The ring was already hidden in my sock drawer, a vintage emerald cut that cost me three months salary. I talked to her dad over beers at his favourite sports bar, booked our anniversary restaurant for Valentine's Day, even practiced the speech in my car during lunch breaks like a complete idiot. When Lisa sat me down that Tuesday night, her face all serious and uncomfortable, talking about needing space to grow as individuals and finding ourselves, I just nodded. Take all the time you need, I said. Watching her fidget nervously with that silver bracelet I bought her last Christmas. She looked genuinely confused by how calm I was staying. Probably expected me to beg, cry, make some desperate emotional speech about our four years together and all our future plans. Instead, I helped her pack her overnight bag, even folded her clothes neatly. The whole time she kept glancing at me like she was waiting for me to break down. The next morning, first thing, I walked straight into the jewelry store downtown and returned the ring, $2,000 back in my account just like that. The jeweler looked sympathetic but didn't ask questions. And I did something completely insane. I bought a one way ticket to Tokyo, leaving in 10 days. I'd always dreamed of teaching English in Japan. Since college. But Lisa absolutely hated the idea whenever I brought it up, called it running away from real adult responsibility and said I was being childish and unrealistic. We had our whole life mapped out. House in the suburbs, two kids, white picket fence. The worst. Two weeks later, I was standing in Shibuya crossing with one suitcase and absolutely terrible. Japanese. Found a tiny teaching job at a conversation school in Akihabara, rented a shoebox apartment with paper thin walls, started learning the language from complete scratch using phone apps and YouTube videos for the first time in years. Life felt electric and unpredictable. Every single day was an adventure. Meanwhile, my buddy Jake kept me updated on Lisa's journey of self discovery through social media. She was posting thirst traps daily on Instagram, hitting different trendy bars every weekend with her girlfriends, clearly living her absolute best single life according to.

My cousin Ellen texted me last night at eleven PM, the kids are so excited to be vampires at your party tomorrow. I nearly dropped my phone. I never invited her kids, not after what happened last year. For context, I've hosted an elaborate Halloween party for the past five years. It's, I think I spent months planning the decorations, curating the perfect playlist and mixing signature cocktails. My friends look forward to it all year. Last October, Ellen called me crying because her babysitter cancelled. Last minute. Please, I haven't been out in months. The twins will behave, I promise. They're better now. Against my better judgement, I said yes. I mean, how bad could a couple of seven year olds be? Catastrophic. As it turns out, within 20 minutes of arriving, they were running laps around my apartment. Ellen just sipped her drink and chatted completely oblivious. The first disaster happened when they decided to play hot lava and jumped from my couch to my antique coffee table. The table, a 200 year old family heirloom my grandmother left me, collapsed under their weight. Ellen barely looked up. Kids will be kids, he shrugged. An hour later, I found them in my bedroom dumping out my makeup collection onto my white bed spread. We're doing monster makeup, they announced proudly, covered in my 50 dollar foundation while I was cleaning up. The makeup disaster. They somehow got into the Halloween candy I had set aside for trick or treaters. They not only devoured most of it, but also fed several chocolate bars to my dog, pepper. By midnight, pepper was violently ill. I had to leave my own party to rush her to the emergency vet. The Bill, $600. When I returned home at 3:00am, exhausted and worried about pepper, I discovered one of the twins had gotten sick and vomited directly into my fish tank. Surprise, Betta Fish, the one I'd raised from a tiny fry, was floating at the top the next morning. Ellen's response to all this destruction? They were over tired. You shouldn't have so many breakable things if you're going to invite children. I didn't invite children. She invited them. So this year I sent beautifully designed invitations with adults only written in bold Gothic lettering at the top. I even called Ellen specifically to.

I paused with my fork halfway to my mouth, scanning the faces around me. Everyone else kept eating like this was completely normal conversation. My husband's sister was cutting her son's Turkey while my mother in law stirred gravy, both acting like someone had just asked about the weather instead of a baby that didn't exist. What baby? I laughed nervously, waiting for someone to explain the joke. The entire table went silent. My husband's face turned the color of ash and his wine glass started trembling in his grip. His brother glanced between us, suddenly realizing he'd stepped on a landmine. Your baby, he said, slowly, uncertainty creeping into his voice. The one with the fever last week when he called me about going to the emergency room. My husband shot to his feet so fast his air nearly tipped backward. We should talk privately, he whispered, voice cracking on the last word. But his brother kept talking, confused by the reaction. The baby you guys have been raising, I thought she was feeling better after that scare. I felt the blood drain from my face. We don't have a baby, I said, each word feeling like broken glass in my mouth. His brother's eyes went wide with horror as he realized what he just done. He turned to his brother. But you told me about her ear infection last month. You showed me videos of her walking. The room was spinning now. My mother in law dropped her serving spoon with a clatter. Walking, I whispered. There's a baby who can walk. My husband's hands were shaking violently. Now I can explain, he started, but his brother was already pulling out his phone. You showed me this video last week, he said, holding up the screen. A beautiful baby girl with my husband's eyes was taking bobbly steps across someone's living room. A woman's voice in the background was cheering her on. I recognized that voice, Rebecca, from his office, who'd eaten potato salad in my backyard last July while complaining about her divorce. That's Rebecca's apartment, I said, my voice eerily calm. I recognized the curtains from her Instagram. The truth crashed over me in waves. How old is she, I asked, though I already knew the answer. They would destroy me. 14 months, his brother said quietly, looking like he wanted to disappear. He said, you guys had her 14 months ago. I did the math instantly. While the room tilted sideways. That meant he'd gotten Rebecca pregnant. While I was researching fertility clinics and taking prenatal vitamins, I was timing intercourse with ovulation strips and lying with my legs elevated for 30 minutes afterward, desperate for the baby I thought we both wanted. You told him we had a baby together, I asked, turning to face my husband. You've been pretending our baby exists while raising one. With someone else. His mother gasped.

But she sounded weird. Really weird. Tip, honey, where are you right now? Her voice was shaky, like she'd been crying. I'm on the bus. We're running late because she cut me off. Listen to me very carefully. Do not come home today. Go to Aunt Pip's house instead. I'll pick you up there later. In the background, I could hear men's voices talking, but I couldn't make out what they were saying. Mom, what's wrong? Why can't I come home? The line went quiet for a few seconds. Then she whispered, just trust me, baby. Don't come to the house. Paul ended abruptly, leaving me staring at my phone in panic. Mr. Bax was watching me in the rearview mirror. What did she say? I told him about going to my aunt's house instead, and his face got this grim expression. The black car was still following us, and now there was a second one behind it. Change of plans, kid. We're going straight to the police station. He made a sharp turn away from both my house and my aunt's neighborhood. Several kids protested, but Mister FAX wasn't taking any arguments. Everyone stay in your seats and keep quiet. This is a safety issue. I tried calling my mom back, but now her phone was going directly to a recording saying the number was disconnected. That. That's when I knew something was really, really wrong. At the police station, Mister Bax, Wouldn't let me get off the bus until two officers came out to escort me. They asked me a bunch of questions about my parents and if I knew why someone might be following me. I didn't have any answers. One officer made some phone calls while the other one stayed with me. After about an hour, they told me that my parents were safe, but couldn't explain anything else. They said my mom had contacted them about a family situation and asked them to keep me somewhere secure. I spent that night at the police station's family services office, sleeping on a couch and wondering if I'd ever see my parents again. Three days later, I found out the truth. My dad had been working undercover for the DEA for months and investigating a drug trafficking ring. Someone had figured out his real identity and threatened our family. The men following the bus were part of the criminal organization trying to grab me as leverage against my dad. My mom's strange phone call happened because those same men were in our house for trying to lure me home. Mr. Bax had spotted them following his route and realized something was wrong. If I had gotten off at my stop that day, I would have walked right into a kidnapping situation. We had to move to a different state, and I never saw Mr. Bax again. But he literally saved my life just by paying attention.

Call your mom right now. I looked up, confused because Mister Bax never talked to individual kids unless someone was throwing things or starting fights. He'd been driving Route 47 for like 10 years and barely acknowledged any of us existed. Why? I pulled out my earbuds and walked closer to the front. His knuckles were white from gripping the steering wheel so hard. Just call her right now. His voice had this urgent edge that made my stomach flip. Fumbled for my phone while other kids started complaining about why we weren't moving. We were stopped three blocks before my usual stop on Cedar Lane. Just sitting there with the engine idling. My mom's phone went straight to voicemail. I tried again. Same thing. She's not answering. Mister Bax was staring at something in his side mirror. And when I turned to look, I saw a black sedan that had been following us for the last few turns. Try your dad or anyone else in your family now. I was really freaking out because, but drivers don't care about your family unless something is seriously wrong. I called my dad and got voicemail again. The black car was still there, just sitting behind us with its engine running. Through the tinted windows, I could see the outline of someone in the driver's seat. Mr Bax, what's going on? My voice Came out higher than I meant it to. He reached for his radio and spoke quietly into it. Base, this is bus 47. I need immediate assistance at Cedar and fifth. Possible situation with suspicious vehicle following my route. The dispatcher's voice crackled back, asking for details, but Mr Bax kept his responses vague. The other kids on the bus were getting restless and starting to ask questions. Jace from the back yelled, yo, why aren't we moving? I got practice. Mr Bax ignored him and kept watching that black car in his mirror. Kip, I need you to listen very carefully when I tell you. I want you to duck down below the window level and stay there until I say it's safe. My heart started pounding so hard I could hear it in my ears. Are we in danger? I whispered. But before, before he could answer, the black sedan pulled up alongside our bus. The windows were so dark I couldn't see inside, but I felt like someone was staring right at me. Mister Bax's hand moved to something under his dashboard that looked like a panic button. Everyone sit down and be quiet, he announced to the whole bus in his serious voice. The car kept pace with us as we started moving again. Staying right next to my window, I pressed myself against the seat back, trying to make myself smaller. Other kids were craning their necks to see what was happening, but something about The whole situation felt wrong in a way I couldn't explain. My phone finally.

So my girlfriend's ex died in a car crash like three years before we started dating. She told me about it pretty early on. And honestly, I felt bad for her. That's a lot to go through. She said she was over it but still stayed close with his parents because they were like family to her. I get it. Grief is weird and people handle it different ways. About four months into us dating, she asked if I wanted to meet them. I'm not gonna lie, I thought it was gonna be super awkward. Like, what do you even say in that situation? But she kept saying how important they were to her and how they'd love to meet me. So I agreed, figured I'd just show up, be polite, shake some hands, and that'd be that first visit was fine at first. His mom was nice, made cookies, asked me normal questions like where I went to school and what my family was like. Then his dad started talking. He was going on and on about his son, which I expected. But then he turned to me and asked what I did for work. I told him I'm an accountant. He looked at my hands, then looked back up at me and said, yeah, I could tell, well, your hands haven't seen any real work. Then he laughed like it was a Joke, I just kind of smiled and didn't say anything because what are you supposed to say to that? My girlfriend didn't seem to notice or care. On the drive home, I mentioned it and she said he was probably just trying to be funny and that I shouldn't take it so seriously. But it kept happening every single time we went over there, which ended up being like once every two weeks. Find some way to compare me to his son. One time he was showing me pictures of his son working on this old truck in their driveway. He said, now that's a real man right there, someone who knows how to use his hands. And he looked at me and said, I bet you've never even changed your own oil, have you? I hadn't. But I also don't even own a car. I live in the city and take the train to work. I told him that and he just shook his head like I said something disappointing. Another time we were all sitting in the living room and he started talking about how his son used to play football in high school, full contact, tough as nails, all that stuff. Then he asked me if I played any sports. I told him I ran cross country. He literally laughed and said, cross.

I just sat in my car in the parking lot and cried for two hours. I divorced her and made sure she got absolutely drained in the process. Then her and Jason got married six months later, like some twisted fairy tale. I told Jason to his face that he was dead to me. Any kids he brought into this world would never be my family. My parents tried to make me forgive him. I moved three hours away instead. Fast forward 15 years. Jason's got four kids now, including the one I thought was mine. I don't interact with them at family gatherings. I'm civil, say hi if I have to, but that's it. Meanwhile, I'm super close with my youngest sister Anna's three kids. I take them to amusement parks, buy them gifts for no reason, show up to every single school play and soccer game. I genuinely love spending time with them and they light up when they see me. I never got married again. Got close once, but I just couldn't do it. I'm in a long term relationship now with someone who understands my damage. I've got a great job in tech that pays well, so I've got plenty of money to spoil my nieces and nephews. Anna's kids, I mean, not Jason's. Last month I bought Tyler, Anna's oldest who just turned 14, a brand new gaming setup. We're talking top tier monitor, custom built PC, mechanical keyboard, the works. The kids obsessed with gaming and his old computer was like 7 years old, barely running anything. Two days ago I went to pick him up from Anna's house for our monthly uncle Nephew day. When I got there, Jason's whole family was visiting. All four of his kids were in the living room with Anna's kid.

I tossed her the spare key and said, have fun. Hours later, she was frantically calling me from a tow yard. I work IT support for a major car rental company. Last Saturday morning, I was deep in crisis mode. Our entire booking system had crashed overnight, and I was the only tech on weekend duty. That's when my girlfriend Maya strutted into my home office with her three friends, all dolled up in festival gear. Ready to go, she announced like I was her personal Uber driver. I looked up from my screen, showing 47 critical alerts. Go where? The music festival, duh. We talked about this. Definitely hadn't. Maya, I'm dealing with a major system outage. Thousands of customers can't access their bookings. I literally cannot leave. Her expression shifted to that entitled look I knew too well. Are you seriously choosing work over me? I'm choosing to keep my job over driving you to a party, her friend Brittany chimed in. Can't someone else handle it? It's Saturday. Maya pulled out her phone with a smirk. Fine. If you're going to be a workaholic loser, I'll just text Derek. He's been asking me to hang out anyway. Derek? This Crossfit bro from her gym who'd been sliding into her DMS for months. Now suddenly he was her backup plan. Instead of getting jealous, I reached into my desk drawer. And grabbed a spare keychain. I tossed it to her. Take the silver Camry parked outside. She caught them looking confused. That basic rental car. I'm not showing up in some economy sedan. Then called Derek. I said, turning back to my monitors. Your choice, she huffed dramatically. Fine. We'll take your boring car. Here's what Maya didn't know. That Camry was part of our fleet. That I'd borrowed while my car was in the shop. Every rental has GPS tracking and remote immobilization for theft recovery. More importantly, this specific car had been flagged three times for the same electrical issue. The engine

I responded, understood. Two days later, their lawyer reached out to me in a panic. I've been the family's financial backbone for nearly 4 years. I paid their 1,800 dollar monthly mortgage like clockwork, plus utilities, insurance, emergency repairs, everything. My name, my credit, my money. They never said thank you. My sister Marissa was always in crisis. Credit card maxed out. I paid it. Car repairs, I covered it. Daycare costs, I sent cash until she figured it out. Three years later, she was still figuring it out. I never said no because I thought this was what family did until I Learned it was exactly what they expected. The first crack appeared while scrolling Facebook. There was Marissa, my parents and the kids in front of the house I was paying for, holding a Home Sweet Home sign. The caption, so proud of our daughter for building a future we can all share. This home is in the right hands. No acknowledgement of me, no tag, no gratitude, just them smiling on a porch I had paid for. Days later, I called the bank. Mortgage was still in my name, but there was a request to change the primary contact to Miss Marissa Harper. Then I found $2,400 missing from my account, transferred to Marissa's emergency card. When confronted, she said, don't make this a thing, Jordan. We needed groceries. I assumed we were still sharing that card. My Mother's response, Marissa is going through a lot. Let's not fight over a few dollars. Few dollars for me. Disaster for Marissa when she missed a phone payment. The family group chat became worse. Someone posted a meme of a man handing over his wallet. Big Brother Energy, pay now, ask never. My cousin tag Jordan. Another, can you cover my student loans too, my father? Only if you name your child after him. Got to keep the donor happy. Nobody defended me. But the final blow came while mowing their backyard. The kitchen window was open and I heard my mother and Marissa talking.

I turned off the stove, grabbed her sign and ripped it in half. I told her I was done with her drama queen act and that she had two choices, either deal with me cooking bacon in my own kitchen or find somewhere else to live when she turns 18. Emma started crying and ran upstairs. Carol came down a few minutes later and told me I was being too harsh. She said maybe we could compromise somehow, like I could use the electric griddle on the back porch when I wanted bacon. I said, hell no, I'm not cooking my breakfast outside like some kind of caveman because my teenager decided to become a militant vegan. If Emma wants to eat nothing but lettuce and beans, that's her choice. But she doesn't get to control what everyone else in the house eats. The next morning, Emma tried a different approach. She came downstairs with her laptop and started playing these really loud videos about factory farming while I cooked. Videos had all these horrible sounds of animals screaming and crying. I walked over and slammed the laptop shut, told her if she pulled that stunt again, I'd take away her internet for a month. She accused me of silencing the truth and said I was afraid to face what I was supporting. I told her the only thing I was supporting was my right to eat breakfast in peace. Yesterday was the final straw. I woke up early to cook bacon before work. And when I opened the refrigerator, all my bacon was gone, every single package. I found Emma in the living room eating cereal. And when I asked where my bacon went, she just shrugged and said she liberated it. Turns out she'd thrown $12 worth of bacon in the garbage disposal the night before. I made her stick her hand down there and pull out every piece she could find. Most of it was ruined, but I made her pay me back with her babysitting money. Anyway, I went to the store before work and bought twice as much bacon as before. When I got home that evening, I cooked an entire pound of it just to make a point. The whole house smelled like bacon. For hours, Emma sat in the backyard with her windows closed and texted her friends about how toxic her home environment was.

So my daughter Emma turned 16 last month and decided she was going vegan. Cool, whatever. I don't really care what she eats as long as she's healthy. But then she started getting all preachy about it, telling me and my wife how we're murderers and destroying the planet every time we ate meat. I just rolled my eyes and kept eating my hamburger. Real problem started about three weeks ago when I was making breakfast on a Saturday morning. I had some thick cut bacon sizzling in the pan and the smell was filling up the whole kitchen. Emma came downstairs in her pajamas, took one whiff and completely lost it. She started screaming about how I was torturing innocent animals and how the smell made her want to throw up. Then she demanded I stop cooking bacon in her house. I laughed and told her it was actually my house since I pay the mortgage and I'd cook whatever I wanted in my own kitchen. She stormed off to her room and slammed the door so hard the whole upstairs shook. My wife Carol tried to play peacekeeper and suggested maybe I could cook bacon when Emma wasn't home. I said absolutely not. This is my house. I've been eating bacon for 43 years and I'm not changing my breakfast routine. Because a teenager watched some documentary about farm animals, things got Worse over the next few days, Emma would come downstairs every morning while I was cooking bacon and stand there with her arms crossed, glaring at me like I was personally strangling a pig, make these dramatic gagging sounds and wave her hand in front of her nose. One morning she even brought down her phone and started recording me cooking, saying she was going to post it online to show everyone what a heartless animal abuser her dad was. I told her to put the phone away or I take it for a week. She called me a fascist and stomped back upstairs. The breaking point came last Tuesday. I was making my usual bacon and eggs before work when Emma came down with this big poster board. She'd made a sign that said bacon equals murder in huge red letters and taped pictures of cute baby pigs all over it. She planted herself right next to the stove and held up this sign while I was trying to cook. I ignored her for about 5 minutes, but then she started making these weird squealing noises that were supposed to be pig sounds. My neighbors could probably hear her through the windows. I finally snapped and told her to knock it off or she was grounded. She looked me dead in the eye and said, ground me then. At least pigs in factory farms get better treatment than I do in this house.

When I arrived, Missus Wilson introduced me as Lily's dad who works at the hospital. Twenty eight kids stared up at me from their desks covered in Lisa Frank folders and Minecraft pencil cases. I heard you guys Learned that blood is blue inside your body, I said. The entire class nodded enthusiastic. Basically, Mrs. Wilson beamed from her desk. I pulled out a vacutainer blood collection tube from my pocket. This is what we use to draw blood at the hospital. Notice something, I held it up. The tube creates a vacuum. No oxygen inside at all. Mrs. Wilson smile started fading as I explained when We draw blood with these. It never touches oxygen until we pop the cap off. But I showed photos on my phone of sealed blood tubes still red. The kids were fascinated. I showed them medical textbook pages on my tablet. Missus Wilson kept clearing her throat, her face getting redder than the blood samples on my screen. But our textbook says it's blue, one boy argued, pointing to their science book. I walked over and check the publication date, 1998. Medicine updates pretty fast, I explained. We used to think lots of things that turned out to be wrong. Miss. Miss Wilson suddenly stood up.

So they showed up in wild outfits as payback for not inviting me. My sister Maya and I have never been close, but what she did was beyond petty. She was marrying her college boyfriend Derek in this fancy destination wedding in Cabo, and somehow managed to get contact information for my entire high school friend group. Here's the thing. Maya barely knew these people. We went to completely different schools after eighth grade, and the handful of times she'd met my friends at family barbecues or graduation parties, she was pretty dismissive and rude to them. She'd make comments about how immature, where they were, or roll her eyes when they joke around. But apparently she decided to invite my whole crew. I'm talking 20 people I'd known since childhood. Jake, Sarah, Mike, Emma, even my ex boyfriend Tyler from junior year, who she'd called a waste of space to his face. They all got these gorgeous, expensive looking invitations with gold foil and everything. I found out the most humiliating way possible through Jake's Instagram story. He posted a picture of the invitation with the caption, um, why would your sister invite me to her wedding but not you? With like, 12 question Mark emojis. My phone started blowing up immediately. Sarah texted asking if we'd had some huge fight. My called asking if it was some kind of joke. Emma sent screenshots of the invitation. Asking what the hell was going on. I was mortified. I hadn't even known Maya was sending out invitations yet, let alone that I wasn't getting one. When I finally worked up the courage to call Maya and ask what was going on, she got this icy tone and said, I wanted people at my wedding who actually support me and want me to be happy, not someone who's always been jealous and tried to sabotage my relationships. I literally helped her plan her engagement party six months earlier. I spent my own money on decorations and stayed up until 2 a m. Making centerpieces.

As everyone applauded, my grandmother sniffed, some people just aren't academic. I should have kept my mouth shut and grabbed another beer, but I've been listening to this crap for two hours straight and honestly, I was done. See, I'm the family disappointment, the one they whisper about at Christmas dinner. 26 years old, dropped out of college, sophomore year, work construction, live in a cramped studio apartment above Mrs. And Guian's Chinese restaurant. The free smell never really goes away. Meanwhile, my cousin Luke's the family's golden child, Harvard bound with a full scholarship, honors program, pre med track kids, been getting straight A's since kindergarten while I was getting detention slips. The reunion was at Uncle Steve's house in the suburbs. You know the type, perfect lawn, two car garage, little solar lights lining the driveway. I rolled up in my beat up Ford pickup, oil stains on the concrete, feeling like I was contaminating their property values just by existing. Everyone was gathered around the backyard deck when I arrived. The adults had claimed the patio furniture while kids ran around with water balloons screaming their heads off. Classic rock blasted from someone's Bluetooth speaker competing with the sizzle of burgers on Uncle Steve's oversized grill. There's Luke's future, Aunt Janet announced, waving a wine glass as I walked up. She was already three drinks in, cheeks flushed pink. Harvard Medical School. Here we come. Luke stood in the center of it all, tall and lean now, hair perfectly styled like some college recruitment poster. Don was the awkward kid with braces. I remembered this version looked like he belonged in a catalog for successful people. We're so proud, Uncle Steve added, bringing a burger with unnecessary flare. Full ride scholarship. You know, they're practically paying him to attend. My mom spotted me lurking by the cooler and waved me over. She was wearing her nervous smile, the one she gets when she's worried I'm going to embarrass the family again. Luke's been telling us about orientation week, she said, trying to include me in the conversation. Sounds amazing, right? I nodded and cracked open a coarse light, letting the condensation drip onto my steel toed boots, the same boots that have been caked with MUD that morning crawling under a house to run electrical lines, you know, Aunt Janet continued, gesturing dramatically. Luke's going to be a doctor, a real doctor. Fine.

I'm not academic at all. The bank statement showed my checking account balance and more importantly, last month's deposit. The number seemed to glow on the screen. Luke squinted at my phone and his face went completely white. That's, that's impossible. Union electrician, I explained calmly, taking a sip of beer. Specialized in high voltage industrial work, power plants, manufacturing facilities, the dangerous stuff nobody else wants to touch. Aunt Janet's wine glass was frozen halfway to her mouth. Uncle Steve had stopped flipping Burgers entirely. I clear about 15 grand a month, I continued, sometimes more if there's overtime or emergency calls. Turns out people pay really well for someone willing to work with electricity that can literally kill you. The silence was so complete, I could hear the neighbor's dog barking three houses down. But hey, I said, raising my beer toward Luke. I'm sure Harvard's great, too, buddy. Maybe in four years of undergrad, then four years of med school, then however many years of residency, maybe you'll catch up. Luke looked like he was going to be sick. Grandma Helen was staring at her hands. Even the kids had stopped screaming in the pool. Anyway, I said, draining my beer, I should get going early. Job tomorrow? We're installing backup generators at the hospital, you know, keeping the lights on for future doctors. I set down my empty bottle and walked toward my truck, leaving 27 relatives in stunned silence behind me. For once, I was the one walking away with my head held high.

She'd always cover it up real quick if I walked by and hide it immediately after. So I came up with my plan. I waited until she went to work one Saturday morning and I knew she'd be gone for eight hours. I carefully lifted up her side of the mattress and found the journal. Instead of reading it, I left it exactly where it was, but I put a tiny piece of tape on the cover that would break if anyone opened it. And I packed up all my stuff while leaving everything that looked like mine still in place. I took my clothes but left empty hangers. Took my gaming console, but left the controllers plugged into nothing. Moved out my dresser but left the drawer handles on the floor where it used to be. I even took my half of the shower curtain so there was just this weird gap in the bathroom. But here's the best part. I wrote her a note and put it inside her journal. Write on the page she'd probably write on next. The note said, hey, Ashley, since you love going through my stuff so much, I figured you wouldn't mind if I went through yours. Don't worry, I only read the parts where you wrote about cheating on me with Brad from your work. Hope you 2 are happy. Together. Bye. By the way, I'm keeping the security deposit since you owe me 200 bucks for my baseball card. Have fun explaining to the landlord why half the apartment is missing. The thing is, I never actually read her journal, but I knew she was paranoid enough to think I did. And I was pretty sure she was cheating based on how she'd been acting lately. It was basically a shot in the dark, but I figured if I was wrong, she'd just be confused. And if I was right, she'd probably freak out. I left that Saturday afternoon and drove to my buddy's place where I'd already arranged to crash on his couch. Around 11 that night, my phone started blowing up with texts and calls from Ashley. First, she was confused and angry, then crying, then angry again. The messages went from where are you to what did you do to my apartment? To how dare you read my journal, to please come back. We can work this out. But the one that confirmed everything was when she texted, I can explain about Brad. It's not what you think. So I was right about the cheating. I never responded to any of her messages and I blocked her number the next day.

I was living with my ex girlfriend Ashley, and we were splitting a one bedroom apartment. She worked at some boutique downtown making like $12 an hour, but acted like she was running her own fashion empire. I was doing night shifts at a warehouse making decent money, but she always complained I was never home enough or that I smelled like cardboard when I got back. Thing is, Ashley had this weird habit of going through my stuff when she thought I wasn't paying attention. She'd check my phone when I was in the shower, go through my wallet while I was sleeping, and even rearrange my dresser drawers, claiming she was just helping me stay organized. I caught her doing it multiple times, but every time I brought it up, she'd flip it around and say I was being paranoid or controlling. What really got to me was when she started opening my mail. Not just bills or whatever, but personal stuff, too. She opened a birthday card from my grandma with 50 bucks in it, and when I asked her about it, she said the envelope was already torn and she was just trying to help. The money was sitting right there on the counter, so I couldn't prove she took any. Something felt off. Then last month, I ordered this vintage baseball card I've been wanting since I was a kid. Cost me like 200 bucks, but it was mint condition and from my favorite player. The package showed up while I was at work, and when I got home, Ashley was acting all weird and nervous. When I asked about packages, she said nothing came, but I had the tracking info showing it was delivered. I went to our apartment manager's office the next day and asked to see the security footage from our hallway. Sure enough, there was Ashley taking my package inside. When I confronted her, she broke down crying, saying she sold it on eBay because she needed money for some emergency. Turned out the emergency was a pair of boots she saw online. That's when I decided I was done. But I wasn't just going to pack up and leave like a normal person. Ashley had this thing where she kept a journal under her mattress that she wrote,

I laughed and said, shoot your shot. Then I booked a weekend trip with the woman she was most insecure about. My wife. Lisa brought this up during our anniversary dinner. Five years married, and she drops this bomb over tiramisu while the waiters lighting our candle. What if we each got one free pass? I've been thinking about my trainer, Luke. I nearly choked on my wine. Are you serious right now? On our anniversary? It's just physical attraction. We're both adults. You could pick someone, too. Anyone you want. It would be fair. I set down my glass and really looked at her. She'd been going to Crossfit for three months, ever since her company moved offices next to that fancy gym. New workout clothes every week. Lululemon stuff that cost more than my car payment. Coming home glowing and energized in ways I hadn't seen in years. Always talking about. Luke says this, and Luke thinks that anyone I asked into my steak. Anyone. I trust you completely. We're secure enough for this. Okay, then I choose Amy. Her fork clattered onto the plate. Saw spattering everywhere. Amy? My Amy? Your sister Amy? Yes. You said anyone, right? No restrictions. Lisa's face went white, then red, then white again. See, Amy was her older sister. The one who'd always been the pretty one, the successful one. The one who got married first, had kids first, bought the Bigger house in the better neighborhood. First Lisa had spent actual years in therapy, working through those insecurities, crying about how she'd never measure up. That's not what I meant, and you know it. How was it different? You want meaningless physical stuff with some guy who probably has ABS tattooed on his ABS? Amy and I have actual history. Emotional connection. Which we did. I dated Amy briefly in college before she introduced me to Lisa at a house party. Ancient history. But it had always been this weird thing between the sisters. Amy would make little comments at family dinners. Remember when we used to go to that place? Lisa would get this look. You're being ridiculous. That was college. Am I? Amy's been texting me about planning your mom's surprise birthday party. We've been talking every day for two weeks. There's definitely unresolved tension there. I was completely making this up. Amy had texted me once asking what cake flavor your mom liked. But Lisa didn't need to know that detail.

Lisa grabbed my arm across the table, knocking over her water glass. Please don't do this. I was being stupid. Luke means nothing. It was just fantasy. Funny how it means nothing now that I have someone, too. I pulled out my phone, water dripping onto the screen. Look, she already responded. I showed her a text I drafted but never sent. Wait to catch up this weekend. It's been way too long. I'll make sure we have plenty of privacy. Mom's taking the kids overnight. Lisa's eyes filled with tears, mascara starting to run. You're really going to sleep with my sister at Mom's house? Why not? You were ready to sleep with Captain Crossfit in whatever hotel room he had planned. And at least Amy and I have emotional connection. Remember what you said about meaningful relationships being better than just physical? The waiter came by asking about dessert and coffee. Lisa waved him away, frantically staring at my phone like it contained nuclear codes. This is different. And you know it. How? Because it's your family. Because it would actually hurt you in a way that matters. Interesting how that works out. She was quiet for a long time, twisting her wedding ring, the diamonds catching the candlelight. Finally, I never wanted to hurt you. I just thought I don't know what. I thought. You thought I'd be cool with you getting railed by some guy named Luke, but you can't handle me.

She even threw in protective hand gestures over her belly whenever the lawyer mentioned my name. My lawyer stayed quiet, letting them dig their own grave. When it was his turn, he simply stood up and said, your honor, before we address any financial claims, I believe we need to clarify something important. That's when he pulled out the court records. Restraining order application, the sworn statements, the police reports, everything Natalie had filed claiming I was a dangerous monster. The judge reviewed the documents, her expression growing serious. Then she looked up at Natalie and asked the question that ended everything. Miss Brooks, according to these records, you filed a restraining order six months ago. You stated under oath that he was violent and dangerous. The order prohibited any contact. You're now eight months pregnant. When exactly did this conception occur? The silence was deafening. Could literally hear Natalie's brain trying to do the math and failing spectacularly. Her lawyer went pale. Natalie started stammering about complicated timing and reconciliation periods. But math doesn't lie. She was eight months pregnant. The restraining order was six months old. Either she'd perjured herself about me being dangerous, or she was lying about the baby being mine. The judge pulled up more records. Security footage from my apartment, showing I've been home every night. My work attendance, even credit card statements, proving I've never been near Natalie. Miss Brooks, the judge said coldly, You've ended contradictory sworn statements. Either you lied about needing Protection, or you're lying about paternity. Both are serious crimes. Natalie tried backtracking, claiming brief reconciliations that weren't documented. But my lawyer presented phone records showing no communication, building key card logs proving I'd never left during her claimed meeting times, even traffic cameras showing my car had never been near her house. The judge didn't just Miss Natalie's claims. She referred her to the DA for perjury charges. Two separate counts. Sometimes the best revenge is letting liars hang themselves.

She thought it would secure her a payout until the judge asked one question. You ever see someone's face when their own lie destroys them? Because I got a front row seat to that exact moment. Natalie walked into that courtroom eight months pregnant, glowing with confidence. She'd been stalling our divorce for a year with every trick in the book, fake emergencies, missing paperwork, sudden mental health crisis that required postpone opponents. But this, this was her grand finale. The plan was obvious. Walk in looking vulnerable, play the abandoned pregnant wife card and watch the judge throw out our iron clad prenup out of pure sympathy. She'd done her research, too, picked a female judge thinking the sisterhood would work in her favor. What Natalie didn't realize was that her own paranoia had already destroyed avoid her. Six months earlier during one of our screaming matches, she'd called the cops claiming I'd threatened her. Complete lie. But she ran with it, filed a restraining order. The next day, stood in front of a judge with crocodile tears claiming I was violent and dangerous, said she feared for her life and needed protect action. The judge bought it, granted the order immediately. I couldn't come within 500 feet of her, couldn't contact her, couldn't even drive down our old street. My lawyer advised me not to fight it, just let the divorce proceed and move on. So I did. Exactly. That followed that restraining order to the letter. Didn't call, didn't text, didn't even look in her direction when I saw her at the grocery store. I had witnesses, security footage, phone records, everything proving I'd stayed away. But here's the thing about restraining orders that Natalie forgot. They create a paper for trail. Every violation gets documented. Every interaction gets recorded. The court system tracks everything. Fast forward to Today. Natalie strutted in wearing a designer maternity dress, one hand on her belly, the other clutching tissues for the Waterworks. It even brought her mother. For extra sympathy points, her lawyer started the sob story, immediately painted me as the classic deadbeat dad who'd abandoned his pregnant wife, talked about her financial hardship and how she'd been left with nothing while carrying our child. Natalie sat there nodding.

I'm actually right behind you and you're the one falling into the trap. Here's the trick. In this corner, I stuffed 100 boats into a single block and glitch the hitbox through the wall. That way when I come in contact with this corner, I get launched backwards into this safe area. As I fly back, I hit this tripwire, which opens this hole in the ground, launches me up and sends two Redstone signals to the Pistons, which extended two blocks, making it so anyone else who falls will die even if they hit the corner. Now, I wanted a chance to use this trap in a real fight, and the perfect opportunity came. I got approached by a player named Arkin who needed my help. You see, he was trying to kill Ty, the last immortal player on the server. But Ty and his teammate, it's noob, are really good at the game. So that's why he came to me. He figured that the only way he'd be able to kill them both is if he had a trap. So I took him up on his offer and we began planning. This is it. Yeah, but it's not a trap. It's not what you think.

Madison stepped forward, tears in her eyes. I made mistakes, but this was our dream house. You're right, I nodded. Right before you told me I'd never afford it, right before you found someone who could. Security. I called to my friend Kai. Please escort these people out. We're family, Catherine. Protect. Family doesn't choose cheating wives over their own blood, I replied. As they were walked to the door, Madison turned back one last time. Don't you think you're being vindictive? I looked around at my beautiful home, the hardwood floors, the granite counters she dreamed about for years. This is just me living my best life without any of you in it. The door closed with a satisfying click. They've been calling ever since. Addison's evicted and wants to work things out. Catherine needs a place to stay. My parents think I'm cruel, but I'm done. Some bridges aren't worth rebuilding. Besides, I love the look on their faces when they realized the failure they'd written off was living in their dream home.

Now my sister, ex wife and parents are furious. I refuse to let them back in. Three years ago, I was married to Madison, who thought my 65 k mechanic salary made me a failure. She'd constantly show me houses online, not to motivate me, but to remind me how inadequate I was. Look at this kitchen, she'd say, shoving her phone in my face. Samantha's husband bought her granite countertops, but I guess I'll never have nice things. I worked overtime, picked up weekend jobs, even sold my motorcycle to save for a down payment. Nothing was ever enough. The final straw came when I surprised her with a vacation I've been saving for. She spent the whole trip texting Evan from yoga class. When we got home, I found them together in our bed, not even ashamed. You're never here anyway, Madison said. Evan actually pays attention to me. The divorce was ugly. She tried to take everything, claiming she sacrificed her career for our marriage. What career? She worked part time at a boutique. But the real knife came from my sister Catherine. We've been close our whole lives. I helped raise her kids, fixed her car for free, loaned her money when her husband was unemployed. Madison told me everything Catherine said, how you never bought her anything nice. Maybe if you'd been a better husband, she wouldn't have needed to find happiness elsewhere. My own sister. Was blaming me for being cheated on. My parents were no better. Marriage is work, mom said. Maybe you both made mistakes. That's when I realized I was completely alone. I liquidated everything and took a job on an oil rig in North Dakota. 18 months of hell, 14 hour shifts in freezing weather, living in a tiny trailer with 3 other guys who never showered. But the money was incredible. Hundred and 20 k a year, almost no expense. I saved every penny, lived on ramen and protein bars. When I came back, I had nearly 200 k o cash and perfect credit from paying off all my debts. I started house hunting and saw it, 42 Maple street, Madison's dream house. She'd shown me this exact house does.

My cousin laughed. Wait, that was yesterday. My aunt showed photos, everyone smiling. My sister muttered, maybe take the hint. I stayed silent. But what I did next wiped their smiles. I should have known something was wrong the second my cousin laughed. It was the night after my nephew Liam's 7th birthday. I'd stayed late rinsing plates, still buzzing from the way his face lit up when I gave him the Lego set he begged for. For once, I felt included. So I said it without thinking. Can't wait for the big family dinner tomorrow. Tara froze, then burst out laughing. Wait, you don't know that was yesterday. My stomach dropped. My aunt casually pulled out her phone, swiping through photos, a long table with fairy lights, champagne toasts, speeches, the annual reunion dinner, the one my mom always hosted, the one I've been at every year, and somehow I wasn't there. Oh, this is right before dessert, my aunt said. That's when your mom gave her speech about being surrounded by all her blessings. Her words shattered me. I turned to my sister. She didn't look up from the dish towel. Maybe take the hint next time, she muttered. Silence. My throat locked. I set the sponge down, picked up Liam's birthday card, stuffed with a gift card, and slipped out the door. On the drive home, her words echoed, take the hint, not cruel. Not angry, just fact like I've been stupid to keep showing up. That night, I replayed every forgotten invite, every missing group chat, every photo I wasn't in. It wasn't mistakes, it was policy. I wasn't. Family, fine then. They could live without me. For years, I've been funding everything behind the scenes. College savings for me as kid, emergency dental work, mom's roof repairs, all hidden as anonymous grants. My L L, C, I never asked for credit, just wanted to help. The morning after, mom called in a panic. The AC is out 8 grand. The guy you usually work with said the fund didn't come through. Did something happen? I dissolved the program. I said flatly, I'm sure everyone who was at the dinner can figure something out. I hung up. Within a week, every fund I'd set up was frozen. The safety net was gone. Two weeks later, my inbox filled.

I ignored them. Then I remembered I still had admin rights to the family group chat. The one I'd created years ago. The same chat I hadn't been added to in months. I renamed it maybe take the hint. Then I removed every single member. No explanation. Just silence. But the lakehouse was the crown jewel. Really? I owned half. Mom sold me her share years ago. They still treated it like communal property. Summers, reunions, weekends. I never blocked them. I even paid for the dock last year. Not anymore. Memorial Day, their biggest tradition. I filed a partition clause restricting access unless new agreements were signed. Of course, Tara hadn't opened her mail. So Friday, I parked my truck across the driveway and waited. Noon, three cars rolled up. My sister, my mom, Tara. Kids tumbling out with floaties. Laughter died when they saw me. You're here? Tara asked. Yeah. Thought I'd enjoy the lake. She crossed her arms. We're staying the weekend. That's a problem, I said. The house is locked for co owner review. The notice was in your mail. My sister snapped. Eli, don't be dramatic just because you weren't invited to one dinner. It wasn't one dinner, I cut in. It's years. It's respect. And you made it clear I don't have any here. Mom's voice softened. Honey, we didn't mean to hurt you. Things just got busy. I almost softened. Almost. I remembered her speech. Calling everyone blessings except me. I know exactly how it is, I said. Which is why it changes today. Either we draft a new agreement or we sell. You wouldn't dare! Tara snapped. I met her eyes. You already destroyed the family part. I'm just handling the paperwork. They yelled, pleaded, cried. None of it mattered. I had every receipt, every clause, every proof. Finally, they left. Silence bloomed behind them. The next morning, I slid a Manila envelope across the post office counter. Inside. The finalized sale contract. My half of the lakehouse gone to a couple I'd vetted personally. With one condition. They put up a gate. Three days later, my phone exploded with calls. My mom's message was the last one I read. Why are you doing this to us? I didn't reply. The house sold, the gate went up, and for once, I was the one locking them out.

When I was 14, I had been begging my parents for a service dog for months. My anxiety had gotten so bad that I couldn't even walk into school without hyperventilating in the parking lot. My therapist told them it would help, but they kept saying no. Dad always said dogs were too much work and too expensive. Mom claimed I was just exaggerating my anxiety to skip school. Dad would joke around dinner, if you're too anxious to go to school, how are you gonna walk a dog every day? So when my cousin Jake called and said his friend couldn't keep their Labrador mix Scout anymore, I said yes without asking. Scout was already trained for emotional support stuff. I met Jake at the park that Tuesday and walked home with this golden brown dog who immediately started following me around like we've known each other forever. My parents lost their minds. When I walked through the door, mom started yelling about responsibility and vet bills. Dad was pacing around the kitchen saying I couldn't just bring home random animals. We're so mad they could barely speak to me during dinner. But then dad got this idea. I could keep Scout for exactly one week to prove I couldn't handle it. He even pulled out this little blue notebook and started writing down everything I did wrong. Day 1, he wrote that I forgot to fill the water. Bowl before school. Day 2, he noted that Scout tracked MUD on the carpet. But something weird started happening the first night Scout was there. I didn't have my usual 3:00am panic attack where I'd end up crying under my blanket. Instead, when I started feeling that familiar tightness in my chest around midnight, Scout jumped onto my bed and put his head right on my chest. His weight was warm and heavy, and somehow my breathing just slowed down. The next morning at breakfast, mom asked why I looked so rested. I told her about Scout helping me sleep, but she just rolled her eyes and said it was probably just the excitement of getting what I wanted. Day three was when things got real. I had this math tutoring session with Mr Peterson that usually left me in tears because I'd get so anxious about making mistakes. This time I brought Scout with me. Mr Peterson seemed annoyed at first, but then something crazy happened. Every time I started bouncing my leg or my breathing got fast.

It's time to declare a winner. So I married into the Callahan family three years ago. And let me tell you, they made it clear from day 1 that I wasn't good enough for their precious son, Tyler. His mom would make these little comments about my community college degree while she went to some fancy state school. His older brother Jeff kept calling me the temp at family dinners. Real cute stuff. Last month, I was looking for batteries in Tyler's dad's garage for the TV remote. I opened this random drawer and found a literal notebook, like an actual spiral notebook with the pool written on the front and marker. I'm nosy, so obviously I opened it. Turns out the entire Callahan family had been betting money on when Tyler and I would split up since our wedding day. His mom bet we wouldn't make it past six months, put down 50 bucks. His dad gave us a year. Another fifty F that jerk. Bet we'd be done before our first anniversary and dropped $100 on it. Even Tyler's Aunt Rachel, who's always super nice to my face, bet on 18 months. Pot was up to $470. I took pictures of every single page with my phone, hands literally shaking. Then I put the notebook back exactly where I found it and went home. Didn't say a word to Tyler that night. Just kept smiling through dinner while my brain was exploding. Here's the thing, though. Tyler's actually a good husband. He's nothing like his family. He always takes my side, calls out his mom's rude comments and genuinely loves me. But this wasn't about him. This was about them. So I started planning. Our third anniversary was coming up in two weeks and the whole family was throwing us a party at their house. Perfect timing. I went to this print shop downtown and got the notebook pages blown up into a massive poster, like 3 feet by 4 feet, spent 60 bucks on it. Then I ordered a custom cake from this bakery that does photo cakes. Put the first page of the Bedding Pool right on top of the frosting. Another $40 anniversary party day comes. The whole family is there, probably 30 people in their backyard. Everyone's acting so fake nice, hugging me, saying how happy they are we made it this far.

You don't get its silly perks. I work at one of those indoor trampoline parks where parents drop their kids off and pretend they don't exist for two hours. The job comes with some pretty sweet perks that nobody talks about. Free access to the trampolines after hours, employee discounts on birthday parties. And the best part, I get to eat leftover pizza from kids parties that parents never bothered to pick up. Plus, my coworkers are actually cool. We're all college kids or people between real jobs, so we just vibe and make the best of it. Enter Bryce, my new manager who got hired three months ago. This guy clearly thinks he's running some Fortune 500 company. Instead of watching kids bounce around on trampolines. First week on the job, he called a staff meeting to discuss professional development and brand image. Talking about a place where the main job requirement is knowing how to work a cash register and occasionally telling kids not to do backflips off the foam pit walls, Bryce started implementing all these new rules. No phones during shifts, even when it's dead empty on Tuesday afternoons. No talking to co workers unless it's work related. No eating the leftover party food because it looks unprofessional. And the worst part, he started scheduling mandatory team building exercises on our days off. But what really set me off was when he started making comments about how my job wasn't real. Work and how I should be grateful for the opportunity to gain work experience. And customer service. Dude literally said this while I was cleaning puke out of the foam pit because some kid ate too much cake before jumping around last week. He really crossed the line. I've been working there for 8 months longer than anyone except the assistant manager. Katie. This family came in for their kids birthday party and everything was going fine until their cake fell off the table. The mom was freaking out. The birthday kid was crying and I felt bad for them. So I offered to comp their pizza order since we mess up food order sometimes anyway and usually just eat the mistakes. It was like 20 bucks, no big deal. The family was super grateful. The kid cheered up and everyone had a good time.

Years later, he is devastated to learn what happened to his son. I had a baby boy when I was 16. Yes, I know what that sounds like. No, we weren't careful. Judge me all you want. I've dealt with that for years. Mike was my boyfriend then. And when I found out about my pregnancy, he did a disappearing act with help from his family. Something. Something. Future college star. Something. My parents were always blunt. What happened next was my choice. After a lot of thinking and deciding, termination just wasn't for me. So I chose to give up the baby for adoption. My parents knew a super sweet couple that was looking to adopt. We met and I knew they were the right people. This turned from a teen mistake to almost a surrogacy. I started homeschooling to finish my education and to have a rest. Adoptive parents were with me for everything and even paid for most of the medical costs. The adoptive mother was a teacher, so she helped me with my school work and prepared me for college. They were present for the birth and I refused to hold the baby. Instead, his actual mother did and it was just right. I've stayed in the baby's life in a distant position as a special aunt. Well, he's no longer a baby and he knows who I am. But his mom is the same woman. Who raised him and I continue to be his special aunt. Only change is now he knows who to call if he needs a kidney. His sense of humor is like mine. Go figure. We talk maybe once in a blue moon, which in all honesty is the best. He's happy and I don't regret giving him up to have a happy life. For my part, I got married six years ago. My husband Aaron was divorced on good terms with Bella. They have two children together, a boy who is 16 and a girl who is 19. Aaron made it clear since we began dating that his kids approval was important and that Bella was part of his life forever, not as a spouse, but as a friend and mother to his children. I also told Bella and him about my teen pregnancy to begin with. My stepdaughter and I get along well with the kids. She's closer to her mother, but still occasionally does girls days with me. It's more like friends, though. My stepson is incredibly close to me. He calls me his other mom and always asks me to be present for important events. We bonded when his childhood dog passed away as my cat died about the same time Bella and I were best friends. I know people have complicated relationships with their partners'exes, but we always show respect to each other. I never tried to take her place. She and Aaron shared something special. Long before I was in the picture. That's their history. And I am a stepmom, not a mom. Her place in the kids lives.

Into the courtyard. Sir, the bathroom window was open. I was investigating ventilation efficiency for my environmental science project. Mr Morrison put curtains on the bathroom windows. But the masterpiece came from Quiet Emily. She noticed the school's old Wi-Fi routers were still broadcasting, just hidden from the network list. They'd forgotten to change those passwords. She connected to school Wi-Fi 2,015 with the password admin 1, 2, 3 and had faster internet than the teachers. Emily, that network was supposed to be decommissioned. Supposed to be isn't the same as was. Sir, how did you even find it? I didn't. My phone did. I have very aggressive auto connect setting. The breaking point came during standardized testing week. The online test required internet, so they had To give all students the password. Within minutes, someone had shared it on a paper airplane that flew across the gym. Then another student wrote it in chalk on the track. A third person trained the morning announcements kid to say it phonetically while reading the lunch menu. Chicken Tenders, W1 f 1 p at s, s mashed Potatoes, w zero r, d beans, 2 dash 0 dash 2 dash 4, chocolate milk, exclamation point, hashtag dollar sign. Mr Morrison called an emergency assembly. Fine, you win. We're going back to open Wi-Fi with content filter. The auditorium erupted. Then Marcus raised his hand. Mr Morrison, about those content filters, don't just don't already found 17 ways around them. Of course you have. The next day, the Wi-Fi password was, please just you sought responsibly 2,024. Someone changed it to we promise, wink, 2,024. Within an hour, Miss Mr Morrison pretended not to notice. He was tired. The students had won and honestly, their grades had improved from all the technical research they've been doing. Sometimes the best victory is knowing when you've been outsmarted by 2,000 teenagers who turned your security system into their favorite class.

I was on a packed flight to Seattle, squeezed against the window. Just as the doors were closing, a woman rushed on board with a bull boy about 5 years old. They stopped at my row and I immediately felt a sense of dread. The boy pointed at my seat and screamed, I want the window, I want the window. His voice echoed through the cabin. The mother didn't shush him. Instead, she leaned toward me with an entitled smile. Would you mind switching? He'll scream the whole flight if he doesn't get the window. She said it like she was offering me a choice. But her tone made it clear she expected me to move. I'm sorry. I specifically booked the see, I replied. The boy unleashed a scream that made my eardrums vibrate. The mother just shrugged as if to say, see, told you, and took the aisle seat without attempting to calm him. A flight attendant appeared. Is everything okay here? This person won't give my son the window seat and now he's upset, the mother said, making it sound like I was bullying a child. The boy started kicking the seat in front of him where an elderly man sat. The man turned around, clearly in pain. I noticed a cane leaning against his seat. The mother patted her son's leg but didn't stop him. He'll calm down once we're in the air. We took off with The soundtrack of the boy's sobs. Then I felt something wet hit my arm. The boy was deliberately squeezing his juice box, so drops landed on me. She glanced up from her phone. Ethan, don't waste your juice, she said, but made no move to take it away. No apology to me, nothing. Twenty minutes into the flight, the boy unbuckled his seatbelt and stood on his seat. Mother was watching a movie with headphones in. The boy grabbed my book and threw it to the floor. Hey, I said. The mother removed one earbud. What's the problem now? Your son threw my book on the floor, she sighed. Ethan, that's not nice. Say sorry. No, I want the window. She just shrugged and returned to her movie. The elderly man turned around. Would you like to switch seats with me? Before I could answer, the mother jumped in. That would be wonderful. Ethan. This nice man is giving you a window seat, actually.

They didn't realize they just declared war on 2,000 bored teenagers with nothing but time and spite. It's started when Principal Morrison announced a new policy. Students caught sharing the school Wi-Fi password will face immediate suspension. The password was 47 characters long, randomly generated every week and only given to teachers. My friend Marcus was the first to strike back. He brought a 30 foot Ethernet cable to school and plugged directly into the computer lab wall. When Mr Morrison walked by, Marcus was sitting in the hallway, laptop connected, cable snaking under the door. Marcus, what are you doing using wired internet? Sir? The policy only mentions Wi-Fi. That cable is a tripping hazard. I put up caution sign. Marcus had indeed placed tiny yellow wet floor signs every three feet along the cable. Mr Morrison updated the policy. No Ethernet cables over six feet. So Marcus brought six separate six foot cables and five friends. They formed a human chain, each person holding a laptop connected to each other, passing internet from the lab to the cafeteria like a digital bucket brigade. This is ridiculous, Mr Morrison said. This is compliance. Marcus replied, each cable is exactly six feet. New rule, no daisy chaining connection. That's when Jennifer got involved. She noticed the smart TV in the library was connected to Wi-Fi. She screen mirrored her phone to the TV. use The TV's browser to create a hotspot that broadcast to her laptop. Jennifer, you're using the school Wi-Fi? No, sir, I'm using the TV's connection. The TV isn't a student. The TV doesn't need suspension threats, she added sweetly. Mr Morrison banned using school devices as intermediaries. Alex took a different approach. He stood outside the teacher's lounge with a clipboard claiming he was conducting a password security audit for his computer science project. He'd ask teachers to write their password down to test memory pattern. 3 teachers actually did it before word spread. Alex, this is deception. This is social engineering research, sir. Very educational. Did you get the password? That would be unethical to reveal. Meanwhile, Sarah had noticed something beautiful. The attendant system auto connected to Wi-Fi when teachers logged in. She volunteered as an office aide and memorized the password as it briefly.

Her hair was a mess. She was still walking funny and she looked like she hadn't slept in days. She saw me and her face went completely red. Hey, neighbor, I said super casually. Everything okay over there? Saw all the plumbers. She mumbled something about a pipe problem and tried to hurry back inside, but then she stopped and turned around. You wouldn't happen to know anything about some soap that got delivered to your place earlier this week, would you? I put on my best confused face. What soap? I order stuff all the time. Why she? I was fidgeting like crazy and kept glancing back at her house. Well, there was this really nice soap that showed up and I thought maybe it got delivered to the wrong address by mistake. I used it thinking it was mine. But she trailed off looking mortified. But what? I asked innocently, it made me really sick, like really, really sick. I've been in the bathroom for three straight days. Mark had to take time off work because I couldn't stop. Well, you know, we had to call four different plumbers because I thought I broke our toilet. I nodded sympathetically. Oh, wow, that sounds awful. You know, now that you mention it, I did order some special soap recently. It was this medical grade stuff for my digestive issues. Super strong laxative soap that My doctor recommended the package said to only use tiny amounts and never use it if you don't actually need it for medical reasons. The color drained from her face completely. Medical, medical soap? Yeah. It's prescription strength. Cost me like 200 bucks. I was so bummed when it got stolen off my porch. Had to reorder it and everything. I paused for effect. Wait, you said you used soap that wasn't yours? She started backing away toward her house. I, I thought it looked like regular fancy soap. Oh, Katie, I said, shaking my head sadly. That explains why you've been having such a rough time. That soap is basically medical grade liquid dynamite for your intestines. You probably used way too much of it thinking it was regular soap. She was practically running back to her house at this point, but I called after her. Hey, maybe next time just knock on my door if you think something got delivered to you by mistake. Would save us both a lot of trouble. She never stole another package again.

Great. How about some fun soap just for you? So my neighbor Katie had been stealing my Amazon packages for months. I knew it was her because she'd always magically have the exact same stuff I ordered showing up at her place a day or two later. New yoga mat. Oh, look, Katie's doing yoga in her yard with the same exact purple mat. I ordered Bluetooth speaker. Guess who's blasting music from an identical speaker the next weekend. The final straw was when she stole my birthday present to myself. This really nice silk pillowcase that cost me like 60 bucks. I saw her hanging it on her clothes line the next day like she owned the place. I was done playing nice. I decided to set a trap. I ordered a box of fancy looking soap bars from this wellness company online. The packaging was gorgeous, white boxes with gold lettering that screamed expensive. But here's the thing, I specifically searched for the most brutal laxative soap I could find. This stuff was made for people with serious constipation issues. And the reviews were wild. People talking about how just one use had them glued to the toilet for hours. I made sure to be home when the package arrived and left it sitting on my porch for exactly 15 minutes before going to check on it. Gone just like clockwork. I waited. Three days passed and nothing happened. I was Starting to think maybe she didn't use it yet or figured out it wasn't regular soap. But then on Thursday morning, I heard this commotion next door. Katie's husband, Mark, was outside yelling something about the bathroom being complete, completely destroyed and how they needed to call a plumber immediately. I peeked out my window and saw Katie walking really weird, like she was afraid to move too fast. She kept looking around nervously and rushing back inside every few minutes. By lunchtime, I saw three different plumber trucks parked outside their house. But it got better.

I was trying to protect Mia from, from a man who saved for 8 months to buy her the ring she deserves. I said I work 60 hour weeks, Nicole. I live in a small apartment and drive an old car because I'm saving for our future, not performing wealth for people like you. Mia was crying now happy tears. You never told me you spent this much. Because it's not about the money. It's about you knowing I'm serious about forever. Nicole fled inside. Several guests followed to comfort her, but most stayed on the deck, suddenly very interested in their drinks. Mia's father shook my hand. I misjudged you, son. The rest of the party was awkward. Nicole stayed inside. When she finally emerged an hour later, eyes red from crying, she walked straight to me. I'm sorry. I was completely out of line. You humiliated your best friend at her own birthday party because you assumed I was cheap. I know there's no excuse. Mia stood beside me. Nicole, I love you, but you've questioned Marcus from day one, the car, the apartment, his job. You've never once asked about who he actually is. I Was looking out for you? No. You were judging him and you were wrong. Nicole left early. Several of her friends left with her. The next morning, Nicole posted a long apology on Instagram about judging people and learning lessons about character versus cash. Got 200 likes. Her comments were full of people sharing similar stories. Mia showed me the post. She's trying. Good for her. Are you still mad? I'm not mad. I'm just done caring what she thinks. We got married last month, small ceremony, close friends, only Nicole wasn't a bridesmaid, but she was there sitting quietly in the back. And I still drive that Subaru because the people who matter don't care. And the people who care don't matter.

I tried to tell you, I said quietly, standing up from the kids table and straightening my tie multiple times. But every time I mentioned the hospital, you assumed I meant volunteering at the gift shop.

Mom, what the shush, baby, you've got sauce on your chin. She interrupted scrubbing at my face while the entire wedding party watched.

While everyone else enjoyed filet Mignon, Uncle Pete walked by and laughed. Still sitting at the kitty table. Huh? Some things never change. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a handful of fun size candy bars, dumping them next to my plate. Save some for after dinner sport. My brother Todd brought his teenage kid. It's over. Pointing at me like I was a zoo exhibit. Remember you guys used to play together when you were little. His 15 year old son looked mortified. Dad, he's literally older than my teacher. But Todd just chuckled. Don't be ridiculous. He's as young as they come when it came to.

A paid off Subaru. Because I save my money for things that matter. Mia was staring at the ring with new eyes. Marcus, this is real. Every receipt from Tiffany includes a certification.

Then at Thanksgiving dinner, he found out I had $30 million and had a complete meltdown in front of everyone. My aunt screamed and my dad. Just growing up, Nathan was the golden boy. New car at 16, vacations to Europe, private schools that cost more than a mortgage. Me, I was the boring cousin, the quiet one, the one working after school just to buy a beat up Honda. At family dinners, Nathan bragged while the adults nodded proudly and my aunt clinked her glass like her son and with some kind of prodigy. Meanwhile, when I got a B+ instead of an a, my parents said I wasn't applying myself. That's how it was. Nathan could fail a class and it was just a phase. But while they were laughing at me, I was grinding. I landed an internship at a finance firm, Learned everything, started investing, built a business. By the time I was out of college, I was sitting on something huge. I just didn't tell anyone. Why brag to people who already wrote you off? Fast forward to Thanksgiving this year, Nathan's at the head of the table bragging about some networking trip his parents paid for. Everyone's listening like he's the next Elon Musk. Then my aunt turns to me with her fake sweet voice and goes, Andy, you're still doing paperwork somewhere, right? The whole table chuckles. Nathan smirks something In me snapped. I set my glass down and said, yeah, paper is worth about 30 million. The room went dead silent. My aunt's hand froze halfway to her wine. My dad just stared like he didn't hear me right. Nathan's girlfriend literally pulled her arm off his shoulder. And Nathan, he laughed nervously. Yeah, right. Stop exaggerating. But I wasn't. That's when it flipped. Suddenly, they cared. My aunt leaned in, voice sharp. If that's true, Andy, family helps family. Nathan's been working so hard, you should give him a boost. Nathan perked up immediately. Yeah, bro, you don't even need all that. Help me out. I sat there swirling my drink, realizing they weren't proud of me. They didn't see me as family. They saw me as a bank account. After dinner, my phone blew up, my aunt texting me.

The caption said, the only one who deserves celebrating. I commented, nice cake. My mom replied, at least someone's worth baking for. I smiled, replied, enjoy it while you can. That same night, I made one transfer, sent two emails. 12 days later, my sister screamed when her landlord called and said your rents canceled. I was sitting at my desk eating leftovers when the notification came through a Facebook tag. I opened it expecting maybe a few birthday messages. Instead, 20 photos of an expensive backyard party, white tents, navy linens, catering trays, a neon sign that said Amanda Con 2025. And in the center, a custom cake with gold cursive to our star Amanda. The caption posted by my mom, the only one who deserves celebrating. Every photo showed smiling faces, my parents, Amanda holding champagne, Uncle Rick and Aunt Laura. Not a single mention of my birthday, which was that exact day. I commented, nice cake. My mom replied within two minutes, at least someone's worth baking for. Then I remembered the text from dad two weeks earlier. Hey, we need a little help, something special. Can you send $500? I didn't ask questions, just transferred it. Now I knew where it went. Shrimp platters, monogram napkins, that gold icing, the same Amanda who the night before had been drunk in our family group chat. Imagine being 28. And still figuring life out. At least one of us isn't a total disappointment. Then dropped a gift of someone slow clapping. Nobody said a word that night. After Jess fell asleep, I sat at my laptop, opened the banking app, the joint family account, the one from last year when dad got his hours cut. And mom said it would help us as the team, except the team was just me. Every paycheck I'd throw in a few hundred. They'd contribute maybe $15. Every other month, I transferred everything out clean, not a cent left. Then I sent two emails. First one to Amanda's landlord. I co signed her lease last year. When she couldn't figure out the paperwork. I'm withdrawing.

At 10:15, Beth calls directly. Randy, they're asking for you specifically. The CTO wants to discuss the pressure sensor modifications you designed for their Portland facility. Wish I could help. I say genuinely meaning it. I liked the Hollowgate team. By 10:45. Marcus, our CEO is calling me personally. Randy, there's been a misunderstanding. Can you come in? No misunderstanding. I was terminated yesterday, effective immediately. Look, maybe Jessica was hasty. We can work this out. Sorry, Marcus, but I can't legally represent the company anymore. I'm not an employee. As a consultant, then. Name your rate. I'm not available. Which was true. I had a phone interview with Drift Shade limited at two PM. Hollowgate's biggest competitor. According to Beth's increasingly frantic texts, the hollowgate team gave Jessica exactly 23 minutes to use the technical documentation they'd specifically flown into review. When she couldn't deliver, they politely excuse themselves and said they'd reassess their partnership options at noon. Jessica calls me directly. Voice shaking Randy, you have to help me. This is sabotage. This is consequences, Jeff, I can report you for withholding company information. What information? I took my personal belongings when you terminated me. All official files remain on your servers. Those notebooks contain proprietary data. Those notebooks contain my personal work notes, purchased with my own money. Check my employment contract. She hung up. Two hours later, my wife forwards me a screenshot from LinkedIn. Jessica had posted about exciting restructuring opportunities. Trying To spin the disaster as strategy check planning. The comments were brutal. Three former clients asking where I'd gone, two competitors offering condolences. Even our supplier in Germany asking if we were still operational. By 4 p m, after a promising interview with Drift Shade, I had my answer to Jessica's sabotage accusation. I hadn't sabotaged anything. I'd simply taken my knowledge with me when they showed me the door. Monday morning, I accepted Drift Shades offer. Senior director of Client Relations. 35% salary increase, equity options and a signing bonus. Wednesday, Beth texted me. Hollowgate canceled their contract. They're switching to Drift Shade. Also, Jessica got fired. Marcus discovered she'd been inflating her performance metrics for months. Thursday, my new phone at Drift Shade rang. Randy, this is Tom Chen from hollowgate. We heard you joined the team. When can we schedule that technical review? Sometimes the best revenge is simply stepping out of the way and letting people destroy themselves.

So about six years ago, I went through this messy divorce that basically split our entire friend group down the middle. My ex husband got most of our friends since they were his buddies from college anyway, which sucked, but whatever. I just accepted that I was gonna lose a bunch of people and started over. The worst part was how some of these people acted afterward. Like this one guy, Tyler, who I thought was actually a decent friend. We used to hang out all the time. I'd watch his cats when he went out of town. We did game nights at their place every Friday, and I even helped him move twice. This dude knew me for, like, five years. Right before my divorce was finalized, my ex invited me to this charity gala, the thing he was involved with. He got me a VIP ticket and everything. Probably trying to show off or whatever. I figured, why not? It was for a good cause, and I was trying to be mature about everything. I'm in the V I P. Area getting my little name tag and gift bag when I bump into Tyler. I gave him a friendly wave and said, hey, expecting at least a normal human interaction. This man literally looked me dead in the eye, then looked me up and down like I was some kind of disease and walked around me Without saying a single word, not even a nod. Just straight up pretended I didn't exist. That hit different. Like I expected some awkwardness, but the complete ice cold treatment from someone who used to text me random memes and borrowed my car. Message received loud and clear. Fast forward about four years. I'm remarried now doing really well at my marketing firm. Got promoted to senior director last year. Life's good. Then one random Tuesday morning, I'm drinking my coffee and checking emails when I see this message in my work inbox from guess who? Tyler Fucking Henderson. The subject line was long time no see with one of those cringy smiley face emojis. Email started with hey there, it's been forever since we connected. Hope you and the family are doing amazing. I'm sitting there like did this man forget? He treated me like I had the plague 4 years ago. But it gets better. The next paragraph basically said he'd been job hunting for a while and just applied to our company. Oh, and by the way, he

So our textbook is wrong. The class erupted in whispers. Missus Wilson's voice got tight. The curriculum says. Actually, I interrupted, pulling up the state science standards on my phone, the current curriculum specifically mentions this myth as something to correct. I showed her the screen. That's when she asked me to step into the hallway. The kids watched wide eyed as the door closed behind us. Do you have any idea how hard it is to teach these kids when parents undermine my authority? She hissed. Now they'll question everything I say! I kept my voice calm. Isn't that exactly what we want them to do? Question things and learn critical thinking? I've been teaching for 22 years, she snapped. I'm not changing my whole curriculum because some nurse thinks he knows better than our textbooks. That night, Lily asked me if she was in trouble because Missus Wilson kept giving her mean looks all afternoon. I assured her she wasn't. The next day, Missus Wilson announced a pop quiz with questions like what color is blood inside the body? Lily answered red and got marked wrong. She came home crying with a big red F. I requested a meeting with the principal and brought printouts of medical textbooks, state science standards, and Lily's quiz. Principal Davis listened carefully, then called in Missus Wilson. When confronted with the evidence, Missus Wilson insisted, this is how I've always taught It Principal Davis asked, but is it correct? After a long pause, Missus Wilson said, it's what the children understand better. I lost it. My daughter is crying every morning before school because she's afraid of getting F's for writing down the Truth. Two weeks later, the school replaced their 1998 science books. Missus Wilson was required to attend professional development on current scientific standards. On Lily's next report card, Missus Wilson wrote, excellent critical thinking skills. But at the parent teacher conference, she wouldn't look me in the eye. And when I signed up to help with the science fair, I noticed my name had been crossed off the volunteer list. Lily still checks with me whenever she learns something new at school. Dad, is this actually true, or is it just a Missus Wilson truth?

My daughter's fourth grade teacher told her class that blood is blue inside your body and only turns red when it hits oxygen. Lily came home repeating this fact while showing me her veins. I gently explained, that's actually not true. Blood is always red because of hemoglobin. Just it's darker red in veins. She looked at me confused, but Missus Wilson showed us a whole Powerpoint about it. Dad. She even had diagrams from a science book. Next morning, I packed my work scrubs in my bag. I'm an ER nurse at Mercy General and I was working the 3 p m. Shift. Anyway, I sent Missus Wilson an email asking if I could do a quick 15 minute presentation about blood for Career Day that afternoon. She loved the idea. When I arrived, Missus Wilson introduced me as Lily's dad, who works at the hospital. Twenty eight kids stared up at me from their desks, covered in Lisa Frank folders and Minecraft pencil cases. I heard you guys Learned that blood is blue inside your body, I said. The entire class nodded enthusiastically. Missus Wilson beamed from her desk. I pulled out a vacutainer blood collection tube from my pocket. This is what we use to draw blood at the hospital. Notice something? I held it up. The tube creates a vacuum. No oxygen inside at all. Missus Wilson smile started fading as I explained When we draw blood with these, it never touches oxygen until we pop the cap off. But I showed photos on my phone of sealed blood tubes. See? Still red. The kids were fascinated. I showed them medical textbook pages on my tablet. Missus Wilson kept clearing her throat, her face getting redder than the blood samples on my screen. But our textbook says it's blue. One boy argued, pointing to their science book. I walked over and checked the publication date. 1998. Medicine updates pretty fast, I explained. We used to think lots of things that turned out to be wrong. Missus Wilson suddenly stood up. Well, thank you for that interesting presentation, Mister. Johnson, but we need to move on to math now. I

I can wear whatever I want before our family dinner. I said, absolutely. What she didn't expect was my response when we arrived. Her confidence disappeared when she realized Sienna was that girl. Fashion marketing, always dressed like she was being photographed. When we met, I loved it. She had confidence. But after a while, I realized she didn't just like attention, she needed it. She wore black to weddings, bikini top to a baby shower she once called a funeral aesthetic. Anytime I mentioned it, she'd roll her eyes. You're so controlling. So I stopped saying anything. Then my mom planned this fancy dinner for my sister Bethany, first doctor in the family. Normal restaurant, black tie vibe. I told Sienna, it's a big deal. Dress formal. She didn't even look up from her phone. I know how to dress myself. Sunday night, I'm in a suit. Sienna walks out in a metallic silver mini dress that looked like she was wrapped in tin foil and bad ideas. It barely covered anything. You look memorable, I said. She grinned. Exactly. Your family is going to die when they see me. She wasn't kidding. We walk in, crystal chandeliers, quiet music, people in gowns and tuxes and she looks like she's headed to a nightclub. The entire place went silent. My mom froze mid smile. Bethany just blinked. The waiter came over immediately. Ma'am, I'm sorry, but we have a dress code. Sienna Scoffed. This dress cost three grand. Yes, he said, but it's missing half of itself. The table was dead quiet. I said, they're just doing their job. She spun on me. Are you seriously taking their side? There are no sides. You said you knew how to dress yourself. That's when she lost it. This family is obsessed with appearances. Sorry, I'm not boring like the rest of you, Bethany said quietly. We just wanted to have dinner. Sienna turned on her. Of course you did, Golden Child. You could hear forks hit plates. I stood up. We're leaving, she glared. You can't make me. You're right. I'm going. You can find your own ride. No one said a word. She waited for someone to defend her. No one did. Then she grabbed.

Dinner went perfectly. After that, my phone buzzed non stop with texts from her. You abandoned me. Your family's toxic. You owe me an apology. I didn't answer. Next night she showed up with her friend Jade yelling that I set her up. I told her you wanted attention, you got it. She screamed, cried and left. Two weeks later, I got a call from my bank. Someone tried to buy $4,000 worth of designer clothes using my card. Shipping address, Jade's apartment. Sienna had saved my card info. I filed a police report and she emailed me at work with an invoice, said I owed her $50,000 for emotional labor. She actually c c'd my boss and my mom. My mom hit reply all thank you for the invoice. Attached is mine, $5,000 therapy after your behavior. $3,000 for the restaurant shawl you refused. $50 teaching my son to recognize red flags. Please pay promptly. But Sienna wasn't done. She showed up at my apartment building knocking on every door, telling people she was my fiance, that I stole her grandmother's ring, that she was pregnant. My 70 year old neighbor called me like, Tommy, there's a shiny woman screaming your name. Police came building banned her. Next morning my car was keyed. Security footage caught her in another metallic outfit. 3 a. M, full glam, scratching my hood. Police added vandalism to the fraud case. Got a restraining order at court. She Showed up in a gold pantsuit, told the judge I was an abuser because I didn't warn her the restaurant had a dress code. The judge blinked. You're saying he abused you by not telling you how to dress? She said, yes. He just sighed. That's not abuse. That's called consequences. Restraining order granted. Then everything collapsed for her at once. Broad charges, job gone, fired after her boss found out she was using company email to threaten me. A mutual friend sent me a screenshot of her latest Instagram post. The universe tests strong women. I'm rising above the hate, manifesting peace and success. Bethany texted me the same day. Mom wants to know if your restraining order includes Thanksgiving. She's ordering extra wine just in case the universe tries to manifest at dinner.

I didn't look fired. I looked lighter. I sat in my car for an hour, staring at the building where I'd spent four years believing loyalty meant something. My phone buzzed. Text from Tyler. Sorry about how things went down. I delete needed it. Then another message. Email from Vanessa. Can you come in tomorrow, 10 a m? The team would like to meet you. I replied, yes. That night, my father said they did you a favor. They showed you exactly who they are. He was right. The Ravion interview took 20 minutes. They'd already checked my references, already talked to Abbot Manufacturing. We want you as regional director. Vanessa said. Double your dry field salary plus commission. When can you start? Immediately. They gave me an office with a window, a company card, team of three and something. Dry field never gave me a clear path forward. Build this division from the ground up, Vanessa explained. Your reputation is why we hired you. I started the following Monday. For two weeks, I Learned the systems and built a strategy. Then I made my move. I sent LinkedIn requests to my old dryfield colleagues. Most accepted within hours. Then I reached out to every client I'd ever Worked with, starting with Abbot Manufacturing. By Friday afternoon, I had three meetings scheduled, all with Dryfield's biggest. Lawrence called me. I let it go to voicemail. He called again. Then Tyler called. Monday morning, I walked into my first meeting. The procurement director from Abbott Manufacturing smiled when he saw me. Jared, good to see you. We were wondering when you'd reach out. By the end of the week, I'd signed two of Dryfield's top five clients to Ravi on contracts. Lawrence sent an email demanding I stop contacting his clients. I forwarded it to our legal team with one line. These are my relationships, not his. Three weeks after getting fired, I closed a deal worth $3 million. Vanessa promoted me to vice president. A month later, I got a call from a recruiter. Dryfield was looking for a new VP of Sales. Lawrence had been let go.

This shows you're not committed to our team, he said, demanding I clean out my desk immediately. I thanked him for the opportunity and left calmly. Monday would be fun. Lawrence Bennett leaned back in his custom leather chair, tan from his Miami business trip. Four years at Dryfield Robotics, four years watching Tyler Davis get promoted over me despite my numbers being double his. And Tyler took credit for the Westbrook deal I'd spent six months building. Then he got a company car. Meeting invites started missing my inbox, little comments in meetings. Are you sure that's the right approach? Last month, I closed Abbott Manufacturing, $2 million, our biggest contract of the year. I flew to Chicago three times on my own dime, worked every weekend, missed my cousin's wedding. When the contract came through, Lawrence took the, came out for drinks, everyone except me. I found out from Instagram. That's when I asked about my raise. Third time asking, the timing isn't right. Lawrence said, we're restructuring compensation. That night, I updated my resume for the first time in four years. A week later, Vanessa Mills reached out on LinkedIn, former dryfield client, now at Ravi. On publishing. Over coffee, she mentioned they needed someone to head their business development to vision, someone like me. I took one Vacation day for an interview. Someone saw me in the Ravyon lobby and told Tyler. Now, Lawrence sat across from me, waiting for me to beg. I understand, I said. His eyebrows twitched. Terminated effective immediately. Clean out your desk. I stood up and extended my hand. He hesitated before taking it. Thank you for the opportunity. The walk back was quiet. Everyone pretending to be busy, stealing glances. I pulled a cardboard box from the supply room, a coffee mug, some pens, a cactus I'd kept alive for three years, four years of my life, smaller than a microwave. April hovered nearby, watching me like I might steal a stapler. I brought in $2 million, they thought.

Oh, and Erica wants to bring their dog. The same Aunt Patty who forgot my birthday every year but never missed Erica's? Here's the thing, mom. I actually don't have room. What? You have four bedrooms. You live alone. My book club is using one for our annual retreat that weekend. My home gym is in the second. The third is my office. I work from home, remember? What about the fourth bedroom? That's my craft room. But even if it wasn't, a guest room only fits two people. And my friend Christine already claimed it. She's going through a divorce and needs somewhere quiet. Complete silence. You're joking. No, but there's a holiday in about 20 minutes away. Great reviews. I can send you the link. After everything we've done for you, I almost laughed. You mean like having room for me for eight years? That's completely different. Erica has children. Erica's kids are teenagers who could have shared a room. Or I could have had the guest room literally once. But sure, mom, it's different. I can't believe you're being so selfish. We're family. You're right. We are. That's why I'm sure you'll understand that I've made other plans. Just like you've made other plans every holiday for the past eight years. Your father is going to be very disappointed. Tell dad I said hi. I have to go. There was no work meeting. I just needed off the phone before I caved, like I always used to. She tried calling back twice. I didn't answer. Then the text started from Erica. Mom said you won't let us stay. That's really messed up from dad. Your mother is upset. Please reconsider. I

Years on every holiday. But they always found a place for my sister and her family. I kept quiet. But this year I bought a house in Florida. And they said, we've packed our bags for eight years straight. I drive 12 hours from Tampa to spend Thanksgiving crammed on my parents couch. Meanwhile, my sister Erica got the guest dream with the memory foam mattress. Every single time. The kids need the bed more than you, mom would say. Erica's kids were 14 and 16. I was sleeping next to the coat closet. Christmas, Erica's family is staying the whole week, so maybe just come for dinner. Easter, we only set up the guest room for Erica. You don't mind the air mattress, right? I minded. But I kept showing up, kept pretending it didn't hurt. Last March, I got promoted to see your director. The raise was life changing. I've been saving for years. And suddenly my dream house wasn't just a fantasy. Three weeks later, I closed on a four bedroom beach house in clear water, Ocean View, pool in the backyard, balcony off the master bedroom. I didn't tell my family. They hadn't even asked about my promotion. When I mentioned it, Erica sent a thumbs up emoji. That was it. I spent two months furnishing it exactly how I wanted. Reading Nook by the window, home gym in the second bedroom, office in the third. The fourth became My craft room. Something I'd always wanted but never had space for. I posted a few photos on Instagram. Just casual shots of morning coffee on the balcony, sunset views. No captions about buying a house. October mom calls. So where should we stay when we visit for Thanksgiving? I paused. Visit? You have that big house.

I thought dairy free just meant no milk products, like lactose stuff. That's what it means on food labels and everything. If you needed vegan, I would have made something totally different. Jenna didn't really respond. She just said it's fine. In that way. That means it's definitely not fine. The whole vibe in the room was awful. Her mom excused herself. Jenna started doing dishes and barely looked at me. I sat there for like two minutes trying to figure out what to do. Then I just said I should probably head out. Jenna walked me to the door and said thanks for coming, but she didn't smile or anything. I apologized again and she just nodded. I sat in my car for a minute before driving home. I felt terrible. Like I genuinely didn't mean to mess up, but also I was so confused because eggs aren't dairy. I went home and googled it just to make sure I wasn't losing my mind. Every single source said the same thing. Eggs are not dairy. They're in the protein section at The grocery store, the dairy section is milk, cheese, yogurt, butter. Eggs are literally from birds. I texted Jenna the next day and said I was really sorry if I upset Mia and that I didn't realise she was avoiding all animal products. I said next time I'd make something vegan if she wanted. Jenna replied like eight hours later with just, it's okay, don't worry about it. That was it. We haven't really talked since. She didn't invite me to her cookout last weekend, even though she invited basically everyone else we know.

The cops pulled up with sirens blaring and my neighbour Phyllis was pointing at my driveway like she'd found a murder plot. She screamed about direct threats and a dangerous child while Alexis, my six year old daughter, sat on the concrete drawing a smiling fun with yellow chalk. When I bought Alexis a giant 64 pack of washable chalk for her birthday, she acted like I'd given her a million dollars. Every single day after school, she'd sit on our driveway and create drawings that ranged from wobbly cats to huge rainbow gardens. The neighbourhood loved it. Parents walking by would stop to say how cute her dinosaurs were. The delivery drivers would always be excited to see her newest creations. Even the grumpy old couple across the street smiled when she drew them an anniversary cake. But there was one person who saw personal attacks in every sick figure, and that person was Phyllis. Phyllis lived two houses down and acted like everyone was out to get her. Every time she spotted Alexis with chalk, she'd mutter about targeted harassment and psychological warfare like she was being hunted. She genuinely believed that my six year old was planning something against her. The morning started like any other Saturday. Alexis dragged her chalk bucket outside at eight in the morning and announced she was going to draw the best garden ever. I sat on the Porch steps with my coffee, watching her hum while she drew flowers and butterflies, until Phyllis stormed over with wild eyes like she'd caught someone planting a bomb. I knew it! I knew you were targeting me! She yelled at Alexis, who looked up confused. I'm just drawing flowers, Alexis said quietly. Don't play innocent with me. This is the third time this week you've left threatening messages on the sidewalk. I stood up from the porch. Leave her alone, Phyllis. She's just a kid. Phyllis jabbed her finger at a pink heart Alexis had drawn near the mailbox. That heart is pointing toward my house. She's telling me she knows where I live and is coming for me. I blinked at her. It's just a heart, Phyllis. She moved on to a drawing of a son with a smiley face. And this son, the razor aimed directly at my bedroom window. She's watching me sleep and mocking me with that face. Her voice was getting louder and more frantic. This child is stalking me, and you're helping her do it. I tried to stay calm. Phyllis, she doesn't even know which house is yours. But Phyllis was already on her phone, her hands shaking. I need the police immediately. This child is threatening me. I need her arrested right now. Alexis looked up at me with huge eyes. Mommy, what's happening? I know.

Phyllis ran up to him before he even closed his car door. Officer, please, you have to arrest that child. She's been terrorizing me for weeks. The officer looked at Alexis, who was now carefully drawing a purple butterfly with her tongue sticking out in concentration. Ma'am, can you explain what's happening? Phyllis grabbed his arm. Look at the evidence. That heart is a direct threat. She drew it pointing at my house to let me know she's coming for me. The officer walked over to look at the drawings, and Phyllis followed him, gesturing wildly. And that sun. The rays are pointing at my bedroom. She's telling me she can see me at night. The officer crouched down. Is that a sun? Alexis nodded. Yeah, for my garden. Flowers need sunshine. Phyllis practically shrieked. See? She admits it. She's using coded language. The officer held up a hand. Ma'am, I really need you to calm down. But Phyllis was on a roll now. And this butterfly, purple, is the colour of poison. She's telling me she wants to poison me. She was genuinely sobbing now, mascara running down her face. You have to arrest her before she does something. She's dangerous. I pulled out my phone trying to help. Officer, this is from three days ago. I showed them a photo of Chalk drawings with princesses and rainbows. And this is from last Monday. More flowers, a lopsided dog and what was hopefully a rocket ship. Alexis draws every single day. It's just kids stuff. Phyllis lunged for my phone. Those are all threats? That's one is a turtle. Right. Turtles carry diseases. She's threatening biological warfare. Alexis spoke up quietly. I like turtles. The officer's face got serious. Ma'am, you called 9 1 1 demanding we arrest a six year old child for drawing with chalk on her own driveway? Yes. I want her in handcuffs. The officer shook his head and pulled out his handcuffs. Ma'am, making false reports to 9 1 1 is a crime. You're under arrest. Phyllis looked horrified. This is a conspiracy. You're working with her, aren't you? The officer turned her around and cuffed her while she screamed. I'm the victim here. Why won't anyone believe me? You'll all be sorry when she strikes.

No syringe, no vial, nothing. The crash cart arrived, and I started working. Gave him a dose of naloxone in case it was opioids. Nothing. Tried atropine to speed up his heart. Still nothing. His breathing was so shallow, I had to put a mask on him. His heart rate stayed at 20. It was like his whole system had been put on pause. When I knew. Lidocaine. Medical grade lidocaine. Enough of it injected directly could slow your heart to almost nothing, make you look dead. But where the hell did an inmate in solitary get lidocaine? Had them bag him up, and we rushed him to the medical wing. I wasn't letting them transport him to the morgue. Not yet. We got him on monitors, and I pumped him with IV fluids and epinephrine. Thirty minutes later, his heart rate started climbing. 40, 60, 80. Then his eyes opened. He looked around, confused at first. Then he saw me, and a huge grin spread across his face. It worked. He whispered. Holy shit. It actually worked. I wanted to strangle him. You almost died, you idiot. Now! I knew what I was doing. Just needed to get out of that box. I couldn't breathe in there, DOC. I couldn't. His voice cracked. I just needed out. Turns out Curtis had been planning this for two days. He paid another inmate named Felix three hundred bucks. Money his mom had put in his Commissary account steal a vial of lidocaine from the medical supply room. Felix worked laundry detail and had figured out how to pick the lock on the supply closet. Curtis injected himself with enough to drop his vitals to almost nothing. He'd read about it in some medical book in the prison library. Thought if they declared him dead, they'd take him to the hospital or at least move him to medical, where the rooms had windows. The craziest part, he timed it. Knew the guard shift change was at 7:45.

That's fine. So my sister in law and brother in law are the kind of people who argue over splitting a ten dollar pizza, but then show up to every family thing expecting free food. Like, they're genuinely nice people most of the time, but when it comes to money, they turn into these weird little goblins who hoard every penny like it's the last one on earth. Anyway, we've had a Costco membership for years. My husband has a card, I have a card. Normal stuff. One day his sister asks if she can borrow his card real quick to grab something. Sure, whatever. Except she never gave it back. months went by and I didn't even notice at first because I had mine. Then it started bugging me because I'd see them posting pictures of their hauls on Facebook. Giant packs of paper towels, those massive jars of pretzels, all that bulk stuff. And I'm thinking, okay, cool. They're using our membership basically full time and haven't said a word about it. So I asked for the card back, told her we needed it for something. He was super nice about it all like, oh my gosh, of course. And handed it right over. Problem solved, right? Wrong. Like five months later, my husband asks where my card is because he can't find his. I'm like, you have yours, where's mine? And he goes, oh, I let My sister borrow it a while back. Just stared at him. This man really handed over my card after we literally just got his back from them. But whatever. I wasn't gonna make it a huge thing. Next time I was at their place, I brought it up all casual. I was like, hey, since you guys use the membership a lot, wanna just split the cost? It's only 50 bucks a year. I figured that was fair. $25

The caption said, the only one who deserves celebrating. I commented, nice cake. My mom replied, at least someone's worth baking for. I smiled, replied, enjoy it while you can. That same night, I made one transfer, sent two emails. Twelve days later, my sister screamed when her landlord called and said, your rents canceled. I was sitting at my desk eating leftovers when the notification came through a Facebook tag. I opened it, expecting maybe a few birthday messages. Instead, 20 photos of an expensive backyard party. White tents, navy linens, catering trays, a neon sign that said Amanda Con 2025, and in the center, a custom cake with gold cursive to our star, Amanda. The caption posted by my mom, the only one who deserves celebrating. Every photo showed smiling faces my parents, Amanda holding champagne, Uncle Rick and Aunt Laura. Not a single mention of my birthday, which was that exact day. I commented, nice cake. My mom replied within two minutes, at least someone's worth baking for. Then I remembered the text from dad two weeks earlier hey, we need a little help. Something special. Can you send $500? I didn't ask questions, just transferred it. Now I knew where it went. Shrimp platters, monogram napkins, that gold icing. The same Amanda who the night before had been drunk in our family group chat. Imagine being 28. And still figuring life out. At least one of us isn't a total disappointment. Then dropped a gift of someone slow clapping. Nobody said a word that night. After Jess fell asleep, I sat at my laptop. Open the banking app. The joint family account. The one from last year when dad got his hours cut. And mom said it would help us as a team. Except the team was just me. Every paycheck, I'd throw in a few hundred. They'd contribute maybe $15. Every other month, I transferred everything out clean. Not a cent left. Then I sent two emails. First one to Amanda's landlord. I'd coast.

So I'm 26, and I've been living with my girlfriend Jess for, like, a year now. We split rent on this apartment downtown, and honestly, it's been great. We're both working normal jobs, paying our own bills, doing adult stuff, you know, living life. My mom, though, she's always had this thing where she thinks I'm still 16. Like, she'll call me at 9 p m. Asking if I ate dinner or if I'm wearing a jacket outside. It's annoying, but whatever. I deal with it. Last Saturday, she texted saying she made me some lasagna and wanted to drop it off. I told her, cool, but come after four because Jess and I were sleeping in. She sent back a thumbs up emoji, so I figured we were good. Wrong. It's, like, two in the afternoon, and Jess and I are in bed. We're both off work and just enjoying our Saturday, if you know what I mean. And I hear the front door unlock. My stomach drops because I gave my mom a spare key for emergencies, like if I lock myself out or something. I hear her walking around the living room, and then she's at the bedroom door. He starts pounding on it, yelling my full name, like, I'm in trouble. Matthew James, I know what you're doing. Jess literally freezes, and Looks at me like, what the hell? I'm scrambling, trying to find my pants and a shirt, while my mom is still yelling through the door about respect and decency. I finally get dressed and open the door. My mom is standing there with her arms crossed, holding a container of lasagna, looking absolutely furious. She starts going off about how disgusting it is that we're doing that in the middle of the day and how she raised me better than this. I'm trying to stay calm, but I'm pissed. I told her she wasn't supposed to be.

I tried bottles, diapers, and even that ridiculous white noise machine the nanny swore by, but she just kept wailing. Come on, kid, work with me here, I said, bouncing her the way I'd seen the nanny do. The screaming only got worse. Her mom really put us both in a bad spot, didn't she? I asked her, and she grabbed my finger hard, like she was holding on for dear life. I was about to call an ambulance, because surely this level of screaming meant something was seriously wrong, when I remembered Melissa used to do the same thing as a baby. The only thing that worked back then was walking her around the kitchen while humming whatever song came to mind. So there I was at 2:30 in the morning, walking circles around my island, humming an old song my mother used to sing, while this tiny person finally started to quiet down. She was looking up at me with these huge eyes that looked exactly like Melissa's before substances took over her life. I kept humming, and she kept staring like she was trying to memorize my face. Then she opened her mouth, and instead of crying, she said it clear as day. Mama, she said, reaching up toward my face with her tiny fingers. No, sweetheart, I'm not your mama, I whispered, but she said it again, louder. Mama, mama! She Said over and over like she was claiming me whether I wanted it or not. I actually laughed for the first time in weeks. You're gonna be stubborn like your mom, aren't you? She babbled something that sounded like agreement. I called the adoption agency the next morning to cancel the meeting. When the lady asked if I wanted to reschedule, I told her I wanted to cancel the adoption entirely. You sure you said you don't want to raise another baby? She said in a condescending voice. Yeah, well, the baby didn't get that memo. I told her this baby had already decided who she belongs to. And apparently, that someone is me.

You don't understand. But I understand perfectly, I said, my whole body shaking with rage. You destroyed my car because I got a house, and you didn't! It wasn't like that! Melissa burst out, desperate. You don't get it! You got the promotion, the house, everything, while I'm still stuck in my studio apartment! So you committed a crime! I shouted. You cost me $8,500! I was drunk! She screamed back. I wasn't thinking straight. And then the next morning it was too late to take it back. Too late? You had three weeks while my car was being fixed! You had every single day since March! My voice cracked with rage. No, I couldn't! Melissa was frantically trying to justify it. How could I tell you after you'd already filed the insurance claim? You would have gotten in trouble, too! I would have gotten in trouble? I laughed, hollow and bitter. My insurance went up $180 a month. I almost lost my job from being late. I had panic attacks for months. You're being dramatic! Melissa snapped, her guilt morphing into defensiveness. Insurance covered most of it. And you still got your precious house, didn't you? The entire party was watching. Now drinks forgotten, phones probably recording. Did insurance cover the therapy I needed? I asked, stepping closer to her. Did it cover the security cameras I installed? The Uber rides because I was too scared to park near my apartment? Melissa backed toward the door. I said I was sorry. No, I said coldly. You never said sorry. You said you were drunk. Get out of my house, I said, my voice steady now. Resolved. Please, we can talk about this. Melissa started, but I cut her off. The police report is still open. My neighbor has security footage from March that he just found on his backup drive. He told me last week that color drained from her face completely. That's insurance fraud, Melissa. That's a felony. And filing a false police report, that's another crime. Jeremiah was already dragging her toward the door, muttering apologies. But I had one more thing to say. My cousin just passed the bar exam. You'll be hearing from her about the $8,500, the increased premiums, and three months of therapy. Melissa turned at the door, tears streaming. You're really going to ruin my life over a mistake? You ruined mine for three months because you were jealous.

See? Mommy helps them sleep forever. Last night she was on the phone telling someone their dad wasn't suffering anymore. I checked our bank account on my phone and saw deposits I'd never noticed. Small cash amounts, twice weekly for months. Small enough that I wouldn't notice if I wasn't looking for them. Heidi, you said Mommy helped grandma, too. She nodded eagerly. Grandma was screaming from the hurt. Then Mommy gave her medicine from this bag, and she got quiet and peaceful. Mommy said it was a blessing. The garage door rumbled open. Brooks car pulled in. She walked into the kitchen to find me sitting at the table with the medical bag open in front of me. Her face went white. Ethan, I can explain. Heidi ran to hug her. Mommy, daddy found your helping medicine. Brooks eyes filled with tears. Heidi, go watch TV, please. After Heidi left, I stood up, my voice shaking. What the hell is this, Brooke? Are you stealing from the hospital? Are you selling them? She sat down slowly. Ethan, no. Tell me right now. These are controlled substances. This is morphine in our home. What are you doing with them? Brooke looked at me steadily. You're not going to let this go unless I explain everything, are you? Damn right I'm not. She took a breath. I'm giving terminal patients enough medication to end their lives peacefully. I steal these substances from the hospital and I give them To families whose loved ones are dying in agony. They take them home, administer them, and their family members die without pain. That's what I've been doing. I stared at her in shock. So you're kill when people. No. I'm ending their suffering when they're already dying. Brooke, this is. You could go to prison for the rest of your life. They could give you the death penalty. I'm giving these people the peaceful death they deserve. Brooke's voice rose. My mother begged me to end her. Ethan begged me, and I did it. I gave her enough morphine to stop her heart while she slept. You're insane, I said, backing away from her. You've lost your mind.

She wrote, Mommy helps sick people sleep forever at the hospital. I was making Heidi's lunch when I found her homework worksheet crumpled in her backpack. The assignment had asked students to describe their parents jobs. In her messy second grade handwriting, Heidi had written word for word, my mommy helps sick people sleep forever at the hospital. I think the hospital doesn't know about it. I stared at the paper and how to chill up my spine because this sounded bad. But kids say the weirdest things, right? My wife, Brooke, deals with terminal patients everyday, helping families through their darkest moments. Heidi probably overheard Brooke talking about end of life care and got confused. But then Tuesday afternoon, my phone rang. Mr. Hale, this is Mrs. Alvarez, Heidi's teacher. We need to discuss Heidi's homework assignment about her mother's job. My stomach tightened. Is something wrong? I asked, and what I heard next sent me into shock. Heidi gave a presentation today. She told the class her mother brings medicine home from the hospital to help people sleep forever. She mentioned that families pay your wife privately for this service. She even said, your wife keeps a special bag hidden in your garage. I gripped the phone harder. Kids misunderstand things, Mr. Hale. Heidi described specific medications by name. Morphine, fentanyl. She even said her grandmother needed the special medicine before she went to heaven. The other parents are Concerned, I left work immediately, my mind spinning. How could Heidi even know those names? And what was this about Brooke bringing medicine home? When I got home, Heidi was coloring at the kitchen table. I sat beside her, keeping my voice gentle. Heidi, Honey, tell me about what you wrote about Mommy's job. She looked up with innocent eyes. I wrote what I see, daddy. Mommy helps people who are hurting really bad. That's right. She

I had to sit in the nurse's office for three hours until the school day ended and I could just walk home. When I got there, they were posting the pictures on Facebook, talking about their perfect little family. I was in the background of one photo walking in the front door looking like death and my mom cropped me out before posting it. That was kind of the moment I realized I was done expecting anything from them. Then last month, they sat me down again. My mom had this serious look on her face and I thought maybe something was wrong. Nope. They told me they've been trying for another baby for over a year and it's not happening. They're doing fertility treatments now. And here's the thing, they need me to watch Sophia every week during their appointments, not asking, telling. My mom handed me this printed list of instructions, like a full page, single spaced. It had Sophia's nap schedule, her snack preferences, what songs she likes, how to hold her bottle, everything. My dad said the appointments are two hours and they'd need me to do this every Thursday afternoon. I just stared at the paper. Then I looked at them and said no. My mom blinked. She goes, what do you mean no? I said, I mean, no, I'm not doing it. She's your Kid, you take care of her. My dad got this annoyed look and said it's only a few hours a week and I'm being dramatic. He actually said I owe them for everything they've done for me. I laughed. I couldn't help it. I asked him what exactly they've done. He didn't have an answer. My mom started tearing up saying I was being cruel and that family helps family. I told her we stopped being a family the second she called me a practice run. I said they made it clear I don't matter, so why would I help them make another kid they'll actually care about? My dad told me I was being selfish and immature. I grabbed my backpack and went to Jenna's house. I've been sleeping there for the past 3 days. Her mom didn't even ask questions. She just made up the guest bed and told me I could stay as long as I needed.

They did. And they need to take care of her, not me. My parents had me when they were 18 and 19, and honestly, they never let me forget it. Like, they didn't say it out loud at first, but you could just feel it. The way they'd sigh when I needed stuff for school. The way they never showed up to anything. Not one single volleyball game, not one art show. Nothing. I Learned pretty fast that if I needed something signed for school, I had to shove it in their face the morning it was due or it wasn't getting done. I'm 15 now, and I basically grew up at my friend's houses. My best friend Jenna's mom would pack me lunch sometimes because she knew my parents wouldn't. Another friend, Kyle, his dad taught me how to ride a bike when I was like, 10 because mine never bothered. It was embarrassing, but also kind of nice, you know? At least someone cared. My parents would celebrate their wedding anniversary every year with this huge dinner and flowers and the whole thing. But my birthday, maybe a card if I was lucky. Christmas was just whatever they'd get me. Socks or a gift card and call it a day. Meanwhile, they'd buy each other expensive watches and weekend trips. It was pretty clear where their priorities were. So two years ago, when they sat me down and told Me. They were having another baby. I was shocked. But then I was kind of hopeful. Maybe. Like, maybe they'd actually try this time. Maybe they'd Learned something. But then my mom started saying stuff, like how excited she was to finally be a real mom, how she couldn't wait to experience being a parent for the first time. And I'm sitting right there, right in front of them. Her friend called her out on it once. He was over for coffee, and my mom was going on about the baby, and her friend was like, um, you already have a kid. And my mom laughed and said I was the practice run, that this baby was the real deal. My dad nodded along like, that made total sense. I left the room, and nobody even noticed. When my sister was born, I completely disappeared. Like, I actually ceased to exist in that house. They named her Sophie, and suddenly it was all Sophia this, Sophia that. My mom quit her job to stay home with her. My dad started leaving work early on Fridays for family time. And by family, they meant the three of them. I got sick at school once. Like, really sick. Throwing up in the bathroom. The nurse called my parents five times. Five.

Did you tell him about Vegas yet? Lol. I responded, Vegas, tell me more. What she confessed next made me cancel the wedding during her bachelorette party. We've been together 4 years. Engaged one. The venue was locked. Caterer paid, dress fitted. She left Thursday for her bachelorette weekend. She and her bridesmaids. Laughter in the air, champagne flutes ready. Everything seemed perfect until Friday. Did you tell him about Vegas yet? Lol. I stared at my phone. Vegas. She went to Vegas 6 months ago for a work conference. Nothing ever about Vegas yet. But I played along. Vegas, tell me more. Three dots appeared. Stay, disappeared, stayed again. Then my phone rang. It was Jenna, her maid of honor. Her voice high, nervous. Tom, I meant to text Kayla. It's nothing. Just a joke about that conference. I said. We're getting married tomorrow. If there's something I should know about Vegas, now's the time. Silence. Can we meet? I can't do this over text. We met at a coffee shop downtown. Kayla had ducked out of party prep. Jenna sat, shaking face pale, tears in her eyes. The guilt's been eating me, she said. What happened in Vegas? She leaned forward. It wasn't just a conference extend. Kayla met up with her ex, Dimitri. They hooked up. Worse, they got married. My gut dropped. Married as in legal. Jenna showed me a photo. Kayla in a White dress, not a wedding gown. But in a small chapel, standing beside Dimitri, they were married. Legal, Jenna stammered. We were drunk, thought it was a joke, but it was legal. She tried to get it annulled quietly. She said it would be handled before your wedding. So she wanted me to marry a woman who's already married. She told me she would finalize it after your wedding. She wanted you to believe the paperwork was done so no one would know. I barely heard her. My mission was set. I left the coffee shop. I drove to the Ritz where the bachelorette party was going full swing. Laughter, music, champagne. I knocked. Tori, Kayla's sister, answered, glass in hand. Tips. Tom, you can't be here. Boys aren't allowed. I squared my shoulders. We need to talk now. Kayla appeared behind her in a sash and tiara. Her face drained. What are you doing here? I said, Vegas, Dimitri, the chat.

I, twenty seven f, have spent my entire life playing second fiddle to my sister Anna. 30th. She's always been the golden child. Growing up, Anna got princess parties with ponies. I got frozen pizza and a cake from Walmart. She got new toys, I got knock offs with pieces missing. Her college fully funded mine. I had to pay rent to live at home while working a $9 per hour job and studying computer science. Every time I asked why she got help and I didn't. You're independent. You'll figure it out. So I did. I skipped meals, borrowed textbooks, and still graduated with a 3.9 GPA. No Celebration, just another night at home like nothing happened. Meanwhile, Anna graduated with a 3.2 and got a catered party with a DJ and champagne toasts. I stopped sharing my life with them. Especially when I started house hunting. I knew the second they found out, they'd find a way to make it about Anna. And they did. A coworker accidentally let it slip that I was looking. Within days, my mom called all fake cheerful. Kate, we've been looking at houses for you. You'll need at least four bedrooms for the kids when they visit, and maybe a pool. I don't have kids. They meant Anna's kids. Then the link started. Every day. Giant Homes with five bedrooms, yards, extra rooms for Josh's office or space for mom and dad to visit. Anna even sent me one that said this would finally give us room to breathe. Us. I stopped responding, silenced the group chat, finished closing on a house by myself. A quiet two bedroom cottage outside the city. It wasn't big, but it was mine. Kitchen, cozy porch, garden in the back. I didn't tell them a thing. Then came the family dinner. I showed up, sat through fake small talk, knowing something was coming. Sure enough, after the lasagna, mom pulled out her phone like she was announcing a real estate deal. We found the perfect place. Five bedrooms? Yes! Sweet. And it's only a few blocks from Anna's. I set my fork down and said, I already bought a house. Silence. Anna stared at me. Wait, what? A two bedroom? Where are we supposed to stay? You're not. Boom! Mom lost it. How could you make such a huge decision without us? We've been helping you. No, I said you've been house shopping for Anna, not for me.

Then her piggy bank was suddenly empty. I went to grab some quarters from my daughter's piggy bank for parking and found nothing but three pennies rolling around inside. Layla was only seven and had been saving up for months to buy a new bike with all her birthday and tooth fairy money. The piggy bank felt way too light when I picked it up, and those three pennies made this sad little noise when I shook it. When Layla got home from school, I sat her down at the kitchen table with her favourite snack. Sweetie, where did all your piggy bank money go? She kept her eyes on her shoes and mumbled something I couldn't hear. What was that, honey? I asked gently. I gave it all to Aubrey, she finally said louder. She never has lunch money, and yesterday the lunch lady didn't let her eat. My heart swelled with pride, but I was also confused. Why didn't this kid have lunch money? The next morning, I gave Layla five extra dollars. Give this to Aubrey for lunch today, okay? She jumped up and threw her arms around me. Thanks, Mommy. You're the best, she said, before running to catch the bus. I couldn't stop thinking about why some kid didn't have lunch money every single day. Because as even when money was tight, we always figured it out. Around lunchtime, my phone rang. This is Principal Rouse, could you come in for a meeting about Layla? Twenty minutes later, I was sitting in the principal's office. Your daughter has been giving money to another student, which is technically against school policy, but we need to talk about the whole situation here. I braced myself. Aubrey's family has been going through a lot. We can't share all the details, but your daughter has been making sure that child eats lunch every day. She paused and looked at me carefully. The family applied for free lunch, but there's a waiting period and tons of paper.

Last December I was killing time at the mall, waiting for my girlfriend to finish her shift at the jewelry store, when a tiny woman in an elf costume grabbed my arm. Please, please, you have to help me, she whispered, her fake pointed ears drooping. Santa just quit mid shift and there are 40 kids in line. I'm 6 foot 4 with a beard I've been growing since October. She looked at me like I was the answer to her prayers. I don't know anything about being Santa, I protested. She was already dragging me toward the North Pole set up. Can you say ho ho, ho and not swear in front of children? When I nodded, she said, you're hired. Before I could object, she shoved me into a break room where a red suit hung on a chair, still warm from the previous Santa. He left because kid threw up on him, she explained, tossing me the pants. Third time this week. I should have run, but she looked so desperate, and somewhere outside, children were waiting. The suit was too small, the jacket barely closed, the pants ended at my calves, and the beard kept sliding sideways. The elf, who introduced herself as Brenda, looked me over and sighed. It'll have to do. Just remember, every kid gets a candy cane. No promises about specific gifts. Absolutely no holding babies. My First kid was easy, a shy five year old who whispered she wanted a Dinosaur. I deepened my voice, said something about checking my list, and sent her off with a candy cane. I thought I had this figured out. Then came Tyler. Tyler was seven, skeptical, and armed with questions. Why does your beard smell like coffee? He demanded. How do you fit down chimneys if you're so fat? Before I could answer, he pulled my beard down and announced to the entire line, this isn't the real Santa! Panic spread through the crowd. Parents glared, children started crying. Brenda

Long silence. You have property that belongs to her. Don't think we won't get it back. Send me a list. I'll have my lawyer review it. Days later, her brother Julian showed up at my office. You've got her engagement ring. Mom wants it back today. The ring was conditional upon marriage. The condition is no longer being met. That ring's worth more than your car. We can make this unpleasant. Are you threatening me? I asked calmly. Phone recording in plain sight. Give back the ring, give Isabel her furniture half and apologize publicly. No. The ring's in secure storage. She can have furniture if she pays moving costs. And I won't apologize for being dumped by a text. That evening, I drove to storage with a sickening feeling. My grandfather's desk had a secret. The compartment I'd shown Isabelle. Once. I opened it empty. My grandfather's watch. Gone. She'd stolen it before I'd even started packing. The one thing truly irreplaceable to me. I'd mistaken my calm for weakness. Fine. They'd get a war fought. With receipts and documentation, I filed small claims for the stolen watch, camera, laptop and Isabel's share of final rent. Court day arrived. I wore a simple suit with one organized folder. They arrived as a phalanx. Marcus, Eleanor, Isabel and Julian. I presented simply. Here's the list. Bills, receipts, photo of me wearing my grandfather's watch. And the text that started it all. I read it aloud. I'm not marrying A broke man. Either upgrade or I'm gone. Marcus argued the items were gifts. Text was hyperbole. I was vindictive. The judge looked at Isabel. Did you take the watch from the desk? Her eyes flickered to her mother. It was a gift. Is that true, sir? No, your honor. It was my grandfather's. Priceless to me. She ruled in my favor on all counts. They were ordered to return everything and pay the watches value plus outstanding rent. Julian had to physically restrain Marcus from yelling at the judge. A week later, a courier delivered the camera, laptop, and a check. Oh, note, I sold the ring and used it as down payment on a condo. A real upgrade. Months later, Isabel texted at 2 a m. Heard you bought a condo. Guess my little push worked. You should thank me. I deleted it without replying.

When I was broke in college, my roommate's cousin Kevin offered me what seemed like the easiest job ever. Manage an online clothing store's Instagram. Post pictures, reply to comments, copy paste stuff. 300 bucks a week, cash through Zell every Friday, plus he'd give me a free iPad to use. I didn't even have to leave my dorm room. I said yes in, like, two seconds. The store was called Sunset Styles. Kevin sent me a drop box full of pictures. Crop tops, jeans, sneakers, dresses. All I had to do was post them with captions he wrote, schedule them for certain times, and answer DMs. Simple stuff. The first week, I got paid exactly on time. I remember buying groceries without checking my account first. Felt amazing. Then the messages started coming in. At first, just one or two people asking where their orders were. I'd forward the messages to Kevin like he told me. He'd say he'd handle it. But more kept coming. People were getting mad. One girl said she ordered a hoodie three weeks ago and got nothing. Another said the tracking number didn't work. I started feeling weird about it, but Kevin kept saying the shipping company messed up and he'd fix everything. By week three, my DMs were full of angry people. I'm talking hundreds of messages. People calling me a scammer, saying I stole their money. I tried talking to Kevin, but He just kept saying, forward it all to him and don't worry about it. He even gave me a script to copy paste. So sorry for the delay. Shipping is backed up, but your order is coming soon. I used that message probably 500 times, and this girl named Becca made a TikTok. She ordered a jacket for 60 bucks and never got it. But here's the thing. My face was in the Instagram stories. Kevin had me do a few try on videos to make the page look real. So Becca Screen recorded my videos and put them in her TikTok with text saying, this girl scammed me and won't respond. That video got a million views in two days. Suddenly, my Instagram was flooded. People found my personal account. They found my school. Someone posted a screenshot of me in the campus library with the caption, scammer goes here. My roommate came back one day and asked if I was actually stealing people's money. I tried explaining it wasn't me, but she looked at me like I was lying. I texted Kevin freaking out. I said I wanted to quit. He said I couldn't just quit because people were.

As Brianna reaches the halfway point, still waving and smiling, my cousin Dan and his brother set directly into the aisle in perfect sync. They pick her up horizontally like a surfboard. One guy has her shoulders, one has her legs. Brianna starts screaming, what are you doing? Put me down right now! They don't say a word. They just carry her straight past the shocked guests, out the side door and into the parking lot. Her bouquet falls on the ground. The entire church goes dead silent, and someone in the back starts clapping. Then more people join in. Then everyone's clapping and laughing. My parents jump up to chase after her, but my Aunt Helen physically blocks the exit. She's a big woman, and she plants herself there like a wall. She looks at them and says, sit down. You've ruined enough of her life. You're going to sit here and watch her get married. We finished the ceremony. It was perfect. Beautiful. Everything I wanted. During cocktail hour, I found out Brianna spent The entire reception, sitting in her car, crying because Dan stood guard at the door and told her if she tried to come back in, he'd call actual security to have her removed from property. My parents tried to apologize at the reception. I walked away mid sentence. They sent emails, texts, called Logan's parents to intervene and mediate. I blocked them and ignored everything for months. Six months later, they finally wrote a real apology letter, admitting they bailed me for decades and destroyed our relationship. They asked if we could start over and rebuild. I responded, maybe when you actually treat both your daughters equally. Until then, I'm done. Brianna never apologized. Last I heard, she's still telling people I humiliated her on purpose at my wedding. Good. She humiliated me for 25 years. Turn about is fair play.

The flight attendant's face changes. She tells the woman, ma'am, you can either take your assigned seat or switch with the passenger seated next to your son. We need to close the doors. The woman grabs her bag and storms off toward the back, still crying and muttering about how cruel people are these days. Like, two minutes later, this guy in his 20s sits down next to me, huge grin on his face. Dude, thank you so much. That kid would not stop kicking my seat during boarding, and his mom just kept saying, boys will be boys. Literally giddy about getting bumped up to Economy Plus for free.

I excused myself to the kitchen to start cleaning up, even though we weren't finished eating. When I came back 10 minutes later, they had eaten everything. Like everything.

I stood. I need time to think. I left them with that word, my buzzing in their ears. For once, they wanted something from me. Three days later, my mom called. They were delaying the honeymoon. No check, no trip. That's when I remembered. I'd loaned them my second car six months ago. It was still in my name, still on my insurance. They'd said it was temporary, a week or two while theirs was in the shop. That was in March. It was now September. I scheduled a tow for Friday morning. 9 12 a m, my phone rang. My mom, there's someone outside towing the car. Did you do this? Yes. I said, silence. Why? I'm changing insurance companies. She said they needed the car. I said, then maybe you should rent one. That's what I'd have to do, right? This is about the wedding, isn't it? No. I said, this is about patterns. I hung up. That afternoon, a text from someone I didn't know. This is Kiara's cousin. I helped organize the wedding. You were originally listed as family. Full access, seated with your parents and Ryan. Three days before the wedding, your Mom changed it. She emailed a revised list. Ryan approved it. I remember thinking it felt wrong, but I figured it was a family thing. They knew Ryan saw my name on the original list and let them move me. They wanted the envelope, not me. I deleted the family group chat, blocked my parents, muted Ryan's number. Two days later, my dad tried again. Family is complicated. We all make mistakes. We love you. No apology, just excuses. I didn't reply. I opened the file labeled loan terms and deleted it. A week later, Ryan's fiance texted. I don't know what happened, but I still think you did the right thing. I replied, thank you. Two months later, Ryan sent one message. I miss you. I read it. Then I blocked his number. They didn't lose a daughter. They lost access to my generosity.

Oh, it's exactly what it sounds like. I held up printed photos. Her and Bradley at the Marriott. Her mom's hand went to her mouth. You've been sleeping with your lawyer and plotting to sell my house. Proof, time stamps, audio, everything. Rebecca screamed. You hired someone to follow me? That's illegal. Recording a fraud scheme. Totally legal. Her sister Nicole muttered, Becca, what the hell? Rebecca snapped, shut up! Tom's loaded. He can afford it. That house is half mine anyway. Eight months, I said. You've lived there eight months, paid zero rent, contributed nothing. You don't own a brick. I pulled out an envelope. You've been served eviction notice. Got 30 days to get out. Your things are already packed. Dennis and Mike are loading the truck right now. Storage unit on Riverside. First month's on me. She lunged at me. Her mom and sister had to grab her. You can't do this. We're engaged. Not anymore. I said calmly. Weddings canceled. Venue vendors all notified an hour ago. And Bradley's wife? She got copies of everything. That shut her up. Her mom, Started crying. Guests gathered. Someone yelled, holy shit! As I walked out. By the time I got home, Rebecca's ring was on the dresser. The PI texted, Bradley's wife just called his office. He's finished. I poured a drink, opened my blinds, and watched the movers haul her boxes away. That's how I ended an engagement, exposed two frauds, and kept my house. All in one afternoon.

My rent money turned into jewelry. I called the landlord right there. I'm filing a police report, I said. Kira stole my rent payments. I have Venmo proof. My landlord's voice turned serious. Come to my office tomorrow morning with your records. Bring your roommate. Kira jumped up, knocking over the Polish bottle. Pink liquid spread across the carpet. You're seriously calling the cops? You stole $2,550 from me and almost destroyed my future, I said coldly. What did you expect? The next morning, we sat in my landlord's office. Kira's parents were on speaker phone. Her mother was crying. She'll pay everything back. Her father said. Please don't call the police. My landlord wouldn't back down. Your daughter committed theft and almost cost my tenant her education. I'm ending her lease immediately. She has 48 hours to leave. Kira was crying, mascara running down her Face in black streaks, but I felt nothing except cold relief. She lost her apartment that week, but I kept her designer bags. I never spoke to her again.

Mon p√®re avait besoin d'un contrat, et c'est moi qui m'en suis occup√©. Quand j'ai termin√©, mon boss et moi avons √©t√© invit√©s √† un barbecue chez ce client.

Pas question de commencer quelque chose d'incertain. Le trajet du retour √©tait super g√™nant √† la maison. J'ai attendu un peu, puis-je suis parti. Les mois suivants √©taient bizarres, je bossais la journ√©e, je r√©visais la nuit, le Weekend, j'√©tais enferm√© dans ma chambre, √† √©tudier. Emma et son p√®re venaient souvent rendre visite √† mes parents, mais j'√©vitais toujours de descendre. J'√©tais concentr√© √† fond sur cet examen. Quand les r√©sultats sont sortis, j'avais r√©ussi.

Une bo√Æte vide sur le comptoir, une autre en train de passer de main en main, elle mangeait direct √† la fourchette. Laura me voit et dit, s√©rieux, tes p√¢tes sont incroyables ! t'as mis quoi dedans ? c'est meilleur que d'habitude. J'ai pos√© mon sac et j'ai r√©pondu calmement, c'est une recette de mon grand-p√®re. Il prend la viande directement chez le boucher. C'est du fromage de t√™te. Elle s'est arr√™t√©e de m√¢cher.

Ses parents payaient tout, m√™me son plan repas. √Ä la fac, elle n'utilisait jamais. Elle pr√©f√©rait commander des livres roux trois fois par jour, ou voler ma bouffe. Apparemment mon seul jour off. Je cuisinais un gros lot de riz, de poulet, de p√¢tes, tout ce que je pouvais me permettre en quantit√©. Je rangais tout dans des bo√Ætes, sur mon √©tag√®re, dans le frigo du dortoir. On avait chacun une √©tag√®re. La mienne, c'√©tait celle du bas, avec mon pr√©nom √©crit au marqueur sur du scotch gris. Mais souvent, quand je rentrais de mon service, vers vingt-deux heures trente, crev√© et affam√©, mes bo√Ætes avaient disparu. Ou bien elles tra√Ænaient, vide, dans l'√©vier. Le pire, c'est que je les surprenez parfois en train de bouffer dedans, camille, avec deux ou trois de ses potes du couloir, assises sur notre canine, √† d√©vorer mon repas. Une fois, une fille, laura, m'a carr√©ment dit en machin, waouh, c'est trop bon ton refrain, hein, alors qu'elle mangeait mon poulet alfredo, pr√©vu pour trois jours, je leur ai dit d'arr√™ter.

Je perdais du poids, je pouvais plus suivre, je mangeais parfois juste une barre de c√©r√©ales le soir. Ma m√®re a fini par le remarquer sur facetime. Elle m'a dit de rentrer le weekend. Alors je suis rentr√©. Et l√†, j'ai cuisin√© le plus gros plat de spaghetti de ma vie. Avec ma m√®re, on a fait la sauce maison, tomate, ail, herbes italiennes.

Then she pulled out a little candy bar with peanuts and almost handed it over to my son before I slapped it out of her hand. I stood up and glared at her. That's it! You're never going to see your grandson until you figure out how to actually be nice and respect my family's boundaries, I said sternly, taking my son to his room to make sure he's fine. My husband went up after a couple of minutes with an angry expression. You shouldn't have done that to her. Now she's downstairs crying when all she wanted to do was help. Help? You're kidding, right? She tried harming our child. Your son! I shouted back. He shook his head at me and walked back out to continue having dinner with his family. After that, I stopped inviting his family over, declined every time she offered to babysit. My husband was still angry at me, saying I was being unfair and holding a grudge over nothing. But I didn't care. My son's health was my priority. But last week I had to leave town when my mom suddenly collapsed. My husband promised he'd stay home with our son, so before I left, I showed him exactly where to find the Epipen and reminded him about all our Rules. Absolutely no peanuts. Okay, I got it. Go and focus on your mom, he said just before I had to rush out. But apparently, after an hour of watching our kid, my husband needed to urgently step out to visit some friends and watch an important game. He dropped off our child to his mom, handed over the Epipen, and told her all the rules that she called useless just weeks ago, expecting her to follow it. She rolled her eyes and said, fine, fine. And he thought that was the end of it. But he was wrong. After he left, she decided to prove once and for all that I've been lying about the allergy. She gave my son peanut butter cookies, thinking she could finally show everyone I was being overdramatic. But then she watched his face swell up and panicked as he started turning purple and blue right in front of her. She called my husband, crying for help while she struggled with the Epipen. He quickly called 9 1 1 and raced back to see the damage. My husband called me an hour later at the hospital. Our son. He had an attack. I drove like a maniac to get there just in time to hear his mother confess that she'd given him peanut butter to see if the allergy was real. But she wasn't even sorry. If you hadn't cuddled him so much, maybe his immune system would be stronger. Even the staff couldn't Believe it. That's when I decided that my mother in law needed to be unalived.

At the funeral, Vince gave this speech about family loyalty while staring right at me. Our relatives wouldn't even look at me. They whispered when I walked by. Everyone thought I robbed my dying mother. Yesterday morning, Vince called me. He said mom left me the house. You've got one week to get out. Just like that? I've been living there for three years, keep it maintained. Then he hit me with his offer. $200,000. The house was worth 800,000 easy. He called it generous, considering what I'd stolen. From mom? I told him no. His voice changed. He said, fine. I'll make sure everyone knows what you did. Your boss, your neighbors, everyone in town will know you robbed our sick mother. Two hours later, Mom's lawyer called, said he had something mom left for me at his office. He handed me an envelope with my name and mom's handwriting. Inside was a letter from two years ago. It just said, Vince has been stealing from me. I know what he's going to do. Trust me. There was a key taped to the paper. That was it. The lawyer said mom told him to only give this to me after Vince claimed the house. I had no idea what any of it meant. The key looked like a bank key, but I couldn't be sure. Why would mom write something so cryptic? That evening, I

Steady and cold. She held up the pen. This isn't a regular pen. It's a recording device. I've been documenting everything for two years. The auditorium went silent. She opened the folder, started reading like she was presenting evidence in court. She read out names of faculty members, dates of incidents, and a short report for each. A teacher mocking a student's free lunch application. refusing homework from a kid whose parent couldn't afford supplies. Bathroom passed denials during girls periods because scholarship students take advantage of privileges. Then she clicked a pen. Voices of the school's staff filled the speakers. Teachers laughing about making certain kids drop out. One voice said, scholarship trash. So clearly, everyone gasped. Kids were standing, teachers turning pale. But Zoe wasn't finished. I clicked on the projector, and text messages appeared on the screen for all to see. A group chat called Standards Committee. It was five teachers. They had a point system for making low income students transfer or drop out. The principal's wife was in the chat. So was my sister's math teacher. Screenshots showed how they'd coordinate to target the same students across multiple classes. How they deny extensions to kids working jobs while granting them freely to others. My brother went through this. Zoe said, voice crack, hacking. These teachers destroyed his scholarship three years ago. Nobody believed him. She held up the pen. He gave me this and asked me to protect the others. So I did. And now all of you will be exposed for what you've done. The auditorium was chaos. Kids shouting, teachers being escorted out. But Zoe kept talking louder. Now, I documented everything. Every comment, every targeted grade, every act of cruelty disguised as standards. Three weeks ago, a freshman girl tried to put an end to herself. She left a note about a teacher calling her a charity case and failing her because of that. That teacher is in the standards committee chat. I showed you. Then she looked directly at me. We met up outside the auditorium doors. We said every volunteering session was surveillance. Every lunch alone was reviewing recordings. That includes protecting a certain someone's little sister. Even when that someone hates me? Even when that someone draws cartoons of me that got me grounded. We both start laughing. Even when that someone tells me we're done. My stomach dropped. Lillian. She'd been protecting my sister while I bullied her, while I mocked her. So I tell her I'm sorry.

My parents banned me from all social media after they watched some weird documentary about how it was the root of all evil. Mom burst through my bedroom door screaming and waving her arms like those inflatable tube guys at car dealerships. We're under attack by social media billionaires! Dad was right behind her yelling, they are using TikTok to steal our children's souls! They. He dragged me to the living room where mom had set up a whole presentation board with printed articles and red string connecting things like she was solving a murder. Every bad thing that's ever happened started with someone posting a selfie. She screamed while pointing at a picture of a kid holding a phone. Dad was pacing back and forth shouting, the internet is where innocence goes to die! Mom showed me a picture of a fried egg. This is your brain on Instagram. You guys are acting insane, I said. Mom literally fell to her knees sobbing. We're saving you from becoming a statistic. She snatched my phone and started deleting apps while speaking in tongues. By the power of good parenting, I cast out these digital demons. Made me sit there for three hours while they deleted every account and mom kept reading fake statistics from. Wait for it. Facebook. Did you know 90% of teens who use Snapchat and got pregnant or in jail? Dad nodded and added, that's basically everyone. At 11:30. That night, mom called our principal on his personal phone, threatening to sue the school if they let me use a computer. I heard him ask, is this some kind of prank? And mom shrieked, you think child safety is a joke? The principal tried explaining that students needed internet access for basically everything, and mom screamed, if you were a real educator, you'd use chalk like they did in the good old days. Rules kept getting crazier every single day, like they were competing to see who could be more paranoid. Mom installed cameras in my room to make sure I wasn't secretly using devices at night. Dad took apart my calculator because he thought it might have Wi Fi, which it obviously didn't. Kids started calling me Amish girl, and honestly, they weren't totally wrong. My friend Brianna felt so bad for me that she gave

Then she saved my family. My ex best friend and I had been inseparable since third grade, when she protected me from a bigger kid trying to bully me. But then we grew up, and by junior year, everything changed. She became the teacher's pet. Always staying after class, defending teachers, first to volunteer for everything. The rest of us couldn't stand it, but there she was, practically living in the main office. Always carrying this fancy silver pen she never let anyone touch her. Brother gave it to her. She said teachers loved her. Students, not so much. Especially me. She stopped sitting with us at lunch. Started eating alone in the library. Senior year, I started the group chat. Called it Zoe's Fan Club. With a vomit emoji. Posted screenshots every time she volunteered for something. Drew a cartoon of her kissing the principal's butt. She tried talking to me once. Cornered me by my locker, hands shaking. Please just trust me, she whispered. I laughed in her face, told her we were done. The hurt in her eyes should have stopped me. My little sister, Lillian, started freshman year that fall. Within weeks, something was wrong. She'd come home crying about pop quizzes she swore never happened. Teachers marking her absent when she was there, her grades tanking despite studying every night. I blamed Lillian. You need to try harder, I kept saying while she sobbed at the kitchen. Table able. One day, Zoe left a note in my locker. Check on Lillian, please. I ripped it up. Teacher Appreciation Week arrived in May. Zoe insisted on planning everything. She organized breakfast, decorated the lounge, created a whole assembly program. The day of the assembly, I sat in the back, ready to mock her speech. The principal walked to the microphone, beaming at Zoe, even encouraging us to stand up and cheer for her. Zoe is a shining example of what dedication looks like. We hope all students can strive to be as amazing as her. Zoe walked to the podium carrying a folder and the silver pen she always has with her. She told me once it was a special pen her brother gave her. I didn't even know she had a brother. I have something to share, she said quietly. My heart stopped. I don't know how to explain it, but her voice.

They had no idea my dad killed people for a living. This happened back in my hometown in Iran, when I was 14 years old. My mom was one of the few women in our village with an actual job, and on this particular night, she was working late. Dad only got home at 3:00am, still covered in dried blood from his shift earlier. And when he saw mom wasn't home, he instantly grabbed his keys. The eldest son, I, went with him. And after what, hours of driving, we found her. My mother was lying in a bush, her hijab half torn, purple bruising around her body and in between her legs. She'd been laying there for hours, too injured to get up, and without a phone to call for help. She was somehow alive, and my dad instantly scooped her up. We could have taken her to the hospital, but my dad worked for the government and knew that doctors would look at an assaulted woman and claim she was asking for. So instead, he treated her at home, using what he Learned from his job to heal all the broken bones and injuries she had. He handmade her crutches out of wood he got from nearby trees. He helped her regain the confidence to go outside. He took over the cooking and cleaning, despite it being against our hometown law. Within five months, my Mother was back to full health. My dad originally had no plans of revenge. Whoever did this would be impossible to track back down. Until the day it happened again. Two full years after the first incident, my mother was walking home from the market in broad daylight when she was surrounded by three boys from the nearby village. They've been eyeing her for weeks. When she tried to walk by them, they formed a tight circle around her and started closing in. First, they took her hijab, ripping it off her and tearing it into pieces. When my mother tried to protest, the oldest slapped her across the face. She fell into the sand. And once she was on the ground, things got worse. They dragged her by force into an alleyway where nobody could see or hear her scream and did things to her I don't want to describe. She only made it home because another woman found her in that alleyway and recognized her. When the front door opened and I saw my mom on this woman's shoulders, struggling to breathe, I felt the worst case of deja vu. Throughout the next couple of months, I saw a different side of dad. He was the tender, loving, and caring husband he'd always been. But when he thought nobody was watching, I saw this rage in his eyes I'd never seen. He started making calls, suddenly carrying guns tucked under

He regretted it when I stopped checking them entirely. My son Geo stormed through the front door last Monday, slamming it so hard the pictures shook. He threw his backpack against the wall and glared at me. You're the worst mom in the entire junior class! He shouted, his face red with anger. I was sitting at the kitchen table reviewing his SAT prep schedule I'd carefully planned out. Every other mom trust their kid. Louis's mom never checks his grades. Eddie's mom doesn't force him to study on weekends. Sarah's mom says she doesn't believe in college. He was practically shaking. Now you treat me like I'm 5 years old. I can't breathe without you asking about homework or college essays or AP score. I tried to explain that junior year determines college options. That's all you care about! He yelled, my GPA, not me! Eddie's mom told him, CS are fine. You freak out over 1 B+! My chest tightened hearing this. I only stressed so much because I wanted him to succeed. Fine, I said, quietly closing my laptop. From now on, your grades are your responsibility. That night, I lay awake thinking about my own past. I'd grown up, or watched my single mom work three jobs just to rent. I'd studied by candlelight when the power got cut off. I watched my mom starve herself so she could feed me. Got into state School on scholarships I fought for. Now I made decent money. The nurse and Geo would never know that struggle, but maybe I was projecting my fears onto him. The next morning I deleted the app to check his grades from my phone. When Geo mentioned he had a calculus test, I just nodded and kept making breakfast. He looked confused but pleased. By Wednesday he was playing video games instead of studying. I didn't say anything. Friday came and he skipped his SAT prep class to hang out with Eddie and Lewis. I bit my tongue and said nothing. The next week he started coming home later saying he was at study groups. I didn't question it even though.

Dozens of permission slips with my forged signature. I've been trying to call you, but the number on file was disconnected. That's when Mrs. Stevenson interrupted. Mr. Davis, there's something else. CPS is coming to your house today at eleven a m. They received a report about educational neglect. If Theo isn't there, if we can't prove where he's been, you could. In custody. My hands were shaking as I pulled out Theo's phone from my pocket. He'd forgotten it in the car. The screen lit up with notifications. 47 unread messages, all from Uncle Mike. My blood went cold. Uncle Mike was Theo's stepdad's uncle. I opened the messages. Don't tell your dad. You know what happens if you tell. The last message sent this morning at 7:30 a m. If you don't come today, you'll never see your mom.

Then her piggy bank was suddenly empty. I went to grab some quarters from my daughter's piggy bank for parking and found nothing but three pennies rolling around inside. Layla was only seven and had been saving up for months to buy a new bike with all her birthday and tooth fairy money. The piggy bank felt way too light when I picked it up, and those three pennies made this sad little noise when I shook it. When Layla got home from school, I sat her down at the kitchen table with her favourite snack. Sweetie, where did all your piggy bank money go? She kept her eyes on her shoes and mumbled something I couldn't hear. What was that, honey? I asked gently. I gave it all to Aubrey, she finally said louder. She never has lunch money, and yesterday the lunch lady didn't let her eat. My heart swelled with pride, but I was also confused. Why didn't this kid have lunch money? The next morning, I gave Layla five extra dollars. Give this to Aubrey for lunch today, okay? She jumped up and threw her arms around me. Thanks, Mommy. You're the best, she said, before running to catch the bus. I couldn't stop thinking about why some kid didn't have lunch money every single day. Because as even when money was tight, we always figured it out. Around lunchtime, my phone rang. This is Principal Rouse, could you come in for a meeting about Layla? Twenty minutes later, I was sitting in the principal's office. Your daughter has been giving money to another student, which is technically against school policy, but we need to talk about the whole situation here. I braced myself. Aubrey's family has been going through a lot. We can't share all the details, but your daughter has been making sure that child eats lunch every day. She paused and looked at me carefully. The family applied for free lunch, but there's a waiting period and tons of paperwork. Meanwhile, we have a seven year old going hungry. I felt my throat get tight. So Layla can keep helping her, right? The principal smiled for the first time. Of course. And we appreciate your kindness. Actually, Aubrey's mother has been asking about you. She wants to pay you back, but she's too embarrassed to reach

She took the rose and laughed, saying she couldn't remember the last time someone had given her flowers. Joel pulled me aside and whispered, dude, what are you doing? I didn't understand the question. I was just being a decent date. Dinner started with Joel trying to dominate the conversation, but Sam kept asking me questions, genuinely interested. She found out I was into classic movies, and suddenly we were deep in conversation while Joel and Jean faded into the background. After dinner, Sam suggested bowling the alley. Sam and I destroyed Joel and Jean. We were laughing, high fiving, and she kept playfully trash talking me every time I got a gutterball. Then Sam wanted ice cream, so we walked to her favorite local shop. She ordered this weird combination of flavors, and I tried it. Even though it sounded terrible, it was actually amazing. We sat on a bench outside just talking while Joel and Jean wandered around nearby. I wasn't trying to steal anyone's spotlight. I was literally just talking to Sam and laughing at her jokes. Jean seemed perfectly happy watching her friend enjoy herself. When we said our goodbye eyes, Sam hugged me and whispered, thank you for actually trying tonight. She asked if I wanted to hang out again sometime, just us. I said yes before I could overthink it. The second Sam and Jean left, Joel absolutely unloaded on me in the parking lot. He said, Bringing a rose was cringe and that I'd embarrassed him, that I dressed way too formally. I looked down at my flannel and jeans completely confused. Then he said the quiet part out loud. You were supposed to entertain Sam so Jean would focus on me, not actually impress her. You made me look bad. I just stared at him. Made him look bad. I barely spoke to Jean the entire night. She had every opportunity to give him attention, but she chose to watch her friend be happy instead. Joel said if I was going to act like that, I should have just stayed home. I got in my car and left without responding. Now he's sending me paragraph long texts about how I violated bro code and ruined his chances with Jean, all because I got a haircut and bought a rose.

I've known Joel for five years now, and we've always been total opposites. He's the confident, athletic type who turns heads when he walks into a room. Me, I'm the chubby, quiet guy who's been losing his hair since 23. We're friends, but we exist in completely different worlds when it comes to dating. So when Joel asked me to be his wingman on a double date, I was surprised. He'd finally gotten somewhere with Jean, this girl he'd been chasing for weeks. Catch gene wanted to bring her friend Sam along. Sam was apparently new to dating and nervous, so gene thought a double date would feel safer. Joel made it very clear what my role was. Keep Sam entertained so he could focus on Jean. Simple enough. I agreed because I had nothing better to do on a Saturday night. Now, here's the thing about Sam. We'd crossed paths a few times at university before this. Every single time, she seemed completely unimpressed by me. And I don't blame her. Those encounters happened when I was wearing the same three rotation outfits. Old band shirts, stretched out hoodies, and jeans that had seen better days. I looked exactly like what I was. A guy who'd given up on trying. But this time, I figured I should at least make an effort. Not for any romantic reason, just basic respect. If someone's giving up their Saturday Evening to sit across from me, the least I could do is not look like I just rolled out of bed. So yesterday I went to an actual barber. I had them cut my hair as short as possible without fully shaving it. Trying to own the ball holding rather than hide it. I cleaned up my beard and shaped it properly. Then I hit the mall and bought clothes that actually fit. A white button up, a flannel to layer over it, and dark jeans. Nothing expensive, just presentable. The day of the date, I kept second guessing everything. Was the flannel too much? Eventually, I grabbed a single rose from the grocery store on the way. Corny, maybe, but I thought it might break the ice. I ended up running five minutes late. My phone was loading with text from Joel. When I finally walked up holding that rose, the energy shifted completely. Joel's face fell immediately. Jean's eyebrow shot up in surprise, but Sam, her entire face transformed. Her eyes actually sparkled.

And I thought I had a FUPA before. Now that I've had three kids, my FUPA has a FUPA. And that FUPA is wearing a fanny pack. I used to be able to take my pants off without thinking twice about it. Now I take my pants off and I'm hungry because my freaking stomach looks like waffles. My belly button may as well be in the freaking Bermuda Triangle because she gone. My belly button's got crow's feet. My milk wagons, they're slipping too. If they go any further south, they're going off the radar. Whenever I wear high waisted jeans, it looks like I shoved a loaf of bread and then dip them and button them right up. But nope, that's not bread. I wish I was a kangaroo so at least my mega pouch would be serving a purpose, but instead it just gets into my way of me shaving. My downstairs mix up. Gave it another bowl cut again. Oh you're so beautiful. Don't say that. You created life. Shut up, Bethany. Why don't you come shave me then? I'm just roasting myself. Figuratively speaking. You could literally probably roast me now because I freaking have the body of a Turkey. Anybody have a buster for this fat ass?

And my father would tell me, five years into me owning a studio that I operate, he asked me, do you got a job yet? He regularly asked me this. Cause my father was a hard working man, a simple man. I never was offended by anything he ever said cause I knew he didn't know what I was capable of. My son would read novels. This is at 6, 7 years old. He would read novels. My father would say, why you got that boy reading them books? I was never offended by cause my father was not a great reader. I love the people that don't understand me.

I personally do not give a sweet, simple shit if you're riding a unicycle in a polka dot clown outfit down the side of the highway, but I'm going to explain what a woman's vehicle says about them. If she drives a midsize SUV or minivan, you can safely assume three things 1. She's got two or more crotch goblins. 2. She's always got snacks and ready to go. 3. She doesn't have time for your bullshit, champ. If she drives one of the nicer vehicles like BMW, Mercedes, etc. She likes to find her things in life so she's not gonna settle. So you better come packing or come with money. If she has a 2,016 or older midsize sedan riding on a spare tire, she has zero fucks to give. She's the one that if you screw her over, she will show up at the church you worship at on Sunday morning in sweatpants and a fucking hoodie. With her hair up in a messy bun. And embarrass you in front of god and the whole congregation. And if she drives a full size pickup truck, her cahones are bigger than yours. In a messy bun.

The boy one goes, burn! That is when I, a grown ass 36 year old adult man, said, nah, uh, I don't, I don't even like these kids. I'm not, I'm not playing with them anymore.

What do you got? Uh, we got a 68 year old farmer. He was building a fence and started noticing some back pain. Ah, did his wife make him come in? Um, no, he came by himself. He's alone? Yeah, he was worried so he came right in. Hey Peggy, wake up. We got a farmer who came in voluntarily. What else did he say? Well, I asked him to rate his pain on a scale from 1 to 10 and he just said uh, I'm here, ain't I? What? Yeah, that's all he said. I don't know what that means though. That's because you're using a paint scale. For normal people you gotta use the farmer paint scale. Uh, is he gonna be okay? Listen to me carefully. Did he finish the fence? No, he had to stop. Dear God. Peggy, get the crash sack ready. It's going down. What's a crash sack? Well, we had a crash cart, but we had to repurpose it as a hospital bed. So we just stuffed everything into a burlap sack. Hey DOC, Jim, Bob's on the phone. He cut his hand. He thinks it's infected. Hey, I don't have time for this. I got a farmer here who quit chores to seek medical care. Well, he's been using Delilah's antibiotics. She had mastitis last year. He just wants a refill. Is Delilah his wife? No, it's his dairy cow. Can you call Leroy with this? I got a Situation over here. I tried. He's in the middle of a root canal. Leroy is the dentist. He's the dentist and the pharmacist. Hey, Peggy, can you tell Texaco Mike to go ahead and gas up the fambo, please? Is Leroy a pharmacist for humans or animals, you think? We have two pharmacists here? Yeah, go ahead and FAX him. It might take him a while to get here. Hey, DOC, Jim Bob called back. He said never mind. Great. What? What's wrong? When a farmer calls asking for help, you gotta jump on it right away. If you wait too long, he'll say to hell with it and you'll never hear from him again. Really? Hey, what did Jim Bob say when he called? He said to hell with it.

If you won that million dollars, a guy named Ed McMahon would show up on your porch with a big ass check, some balloons and a camera crew and knock on your door and film your reaction. We all remember this, right? Wrong. It never happened. Epic Man never worked for, made commercials for, or was affiliated with the PCH in any way possible. And the internet is backing this up. You can't find footage of Edmund Man delivering checks on the internet. It's been wiped from existence. They're saying that we're all wrong. It's something called the Mandela Effect, where this large group of people remember something incorrectly and nobody can explain why his face was on the envelopes. There's even TV shows that reference this happening. What? I'm one of the winners of the Publishers Clearing House. Ed McMahon wants to see me right away. So what is the entire internet like, lying to us? Did they get together with PCH and be like, hey, let's fuck with the whole world and tell them That Epic Man never did this. Or did he really never do it and there was a glitch in the matrix and we are living in a parallel universe? Like, I could not sleep last night.

You better get home right now. We are having this baby in this house. So I gun it to 117 miles an hour.

I run upstairs into the master bedroom, where my wife's on all fours. I say, babe, do you want me to move? She says, don't touch me. So I'm not a smart man, but I ain't that stupid, so I don't touch her. So what do I do? I get down like this. So now I'm down here. I look. I can see that she wasn't lying. We're having this baby in this house. So now I'm down here. Her buttholes over here. And then it hits me. Sometimes women poop when they give birth. So I'm still down there, just looking at the top of my kid's head. Her butthole. Still looking at the top of my head. And I'm worried, like, what if she farts in my eye and I get pink eye? I'm not gonna be able to see my kid for the first week of his life. Pray, sweet baby Jesus I do not get pooped on. Fast forward four minutes. My kid flies out like a Rob Gronkowski spike. He was a slippery little sucker. It wasn't pretty, but I bobbled him, and then I caught him. Now I've got the greatest story in the world to tell. Not only that, but 15 years from now, when my kids being a little dirt bag, I can tell him, I brought you in this world, and I could take you out, and I could mean it. You don't believe me?

I just got out of target, and I was standing in line behind a mom and her daughter waiting to check out. The girl was goofing around, messing around, looking at me and smiling. Of course, I was obliging because I love these little moments. She's showing me her preschool folder. I think she looked about four or five, maybe. I don't know. Out of nowhere, she looks at me and says, today I figured out that if I hold the sides of my butt, I can't even get it out. If I hold the sides of my butt open, my farts don't make noises. I started laughing. The girl started laughing, and the mom whips her head around like she was mortified. I said, don't worry about it. This is life changing news for me. Frankly, I was a little annoyed. I hadn't have thought about this yet in my life. So if you're the mom of Maggie Lucille that was at target this morning in south central Pennsylvania, your girl's going places.

So if you're watching this and you work with me, surprise! I lied. Yesterday, I was working, and somebody says to me, hey, there's food in the break room, leftover from party. Go get some food. Free food. Don't have to tell me twice. So I get in there. There's some leftover chick fil A sandwiches. Warm that up. And there's some leftover baked beans in a Crock Pot. Warm that up. Go on with my day. Delicious. All of it delicious. Today I'm sitting at the nurse's station, and my friend Mary says to me, Jen, did you ever get your crock pot? What Crock Pot? She said, you remember when you. Do you remember when we had barbecue last month and you brought the baked beans? No. What baked beans? What Crock Pot? Oh, well, they're in the break room. Uh, it was full of baked beans. I found it on top of the fridge. What? She said, you didn't mean them, did you? No, I ate my. I'm not. Like a month ago. I had the most aggressive form of diarrhea last night, and I did not know what was wrong with me. Now I do. In telling the story, I am realizing I still forgot the Crock Pot.

I'm sorry, but did you just say that we blame everything on our hormones? And are you talking about the hormones that cause us to bleed for seven days out of every 28 and cause cramps that can rival the pain from a heart attack? Yeah, hormones must really be no big deal, seeing as they can cause a four course meal to drain from my nipple and prepare a perfect storm in my uterus so that I can create a human life. I can assure you that we are not allowed to blame our hormones for anything. Which is why we're still expected to show up at work on time and with a smile, even when we're passing clots that can rival the size of Pluto and ruining multiple pairs of pants with the lining of our own uterus. But do you know who does blame everything on our hormones? Men. You all just love to tell everyone that we're on our period if we dare show any semblance of anger. And you actually ask us if we're pmsing. If we happen to shed a tear, that means you're the ones who have found a way to invalidate the very legitimate feelings of women by crying over hormones. But you're saying that we're the ones with the excuses. And listen, I've heard men try to blame a sexual Assault on the size of a woman's skirt. So I'm not sure why you're trying to compare that to women having a very legitimate hankering for chocolate. And on that note, I'm pretty sure you've also used our hormones as an excuse to keep women out of the military and out of positions of power. All the while blaming your testosterone for why you punch holes in the wall because of your anger and have trouble staying faithful because of your urges. I don't know why you're acting like employers just hand out candy during that time of the month. And our desks are coming equipped with heating pads and some Midol. Listen, if anyone was catering to women's hormones, then period wouldn't be a word we have to whisper, tampons wouldn't be something we have to exchange in secret, and pads wouldn't be something we still have to pay for in public restrooms. Cause we're not exactly living in a hormone tolerant world if y'all get the toilet paper to wipe your asses for free. But we still can't get a piece of cotton to stop the bleeding without some form of payment or an Amex

There's a lot of emotions, okay? We have three children, and everybody just has big feelings right now, okay? And last night, everybody was kind of at their wits end, end of their rope. I'm over stimulated. The kids are not happy about their individual things that they are not happy about, whether it makes sense or not. And at one point, I looked at my daughter and I said, honey, I'm so sorry that you feel that way. Did you know when I was a kid, we weren't allowed to have emotions? And while my daughter is looking at me like I'm a crazy person who just spoke another language to her, my husband doesn't miss a beat. He pokes his head out from the bathroom down the hall, where he's brushing the teeth of our two younger boys, and he looks at her dead serious, and he goes, she's right. It's true.

The last summer I start having issues hearing out of my right ear. So I go to the doctor like any normal person would and the guy looks in my ear with that little flashlight nozzle thing and he goes, hmm? And I go, what? And he says you don't have an ear canal. Well, I did. Haven't missed any payments. Who took it? He sends me to the very convenient ear specialist around the corner, who then looks in my ear and goes, Jesus, that is not the first thing I want my doctor to say to me. You think you know where this is going and you think it's gonna be a bug? Wrong. This man informs me that there is a small tooth sized bone growing across my ear. So I'm sitting there trying to process this like, so should I go to the dentist? And he goes, oh no. It's only covering about 60% of your ear canal, so as long as it doesn't start growing more, then you don't need immediate surgery. Now I can't go underwater or else it gets trapped behind my ear tooth. Also to the person on Twitter who said I wasn't getting enough action so my body had to start boning itself. That was mean.

Which pencil would you rather be? This one. And what do we like about this pencil? That's right. It hasn't been used. You probably see these a lot cause you're 12. Now, what about this pencil? It's been used a lot. And probably by sharpeners that didn't even care about it. Every time you let a woman have sex with you, even if she says she loves you. You are giving pieces of yourself away that you can never get back. And you will be nothing for your wife. That goes for sharpening your own pencil too, okay? People will say that it's natural and it's healthy. But it's gross and it's wrong. And you should be deeply ashamed of yourself.

And they're like, oh, you know, keep a PG thirteen. And I volunteered to say the first joke, and I said, it's PG thirteen, but it's about the human body. Like, oh, we're all adults, we can handle them. Like, okay, perfect. So all of the parts of the body got together to decide who should be in charge. The brain, being the brain was like, listen, I'm in control of all of you. I should be in charge. The feet chime, and they're like, no, we should be in charge because we do all the heavy. We literally carry all of you. So we, you are in charge. The asshole chimes in, and he's like, listen, without me, you can't get rid of none of the shit that we don't need no more. And the brains like, hold up, guys, hold up. Feet, you can't move unless I say you move. You wouldn't even know how to put one foot in front of the other. And asshole, all you do is open and close. You don't even know how this shit gets made. You have nothing to say here. The feet agreed. The asshole took it personally, though, and he decided to go on strike and stop working for 3 days. That asshole did not open And you know what happened? That whole body got filled with shit. So they had to have an emergency meeting. And they all got together and they're like, brain, brain, please let this asshole be in charge. Like, we're all gonna die unless this asshole's in charge. And the brains like, okay, asshole, you can be in charge. Moral of the story is, sometimes there's an asshole in charge. It's not necessarily because he's the smartest one of the group. No, he's just an asshole. And sometimes assholes are in places of power. Thinking about it, maybe saying that to all the supervisors wasn't the best course of action, you know? But it is just a joke, you know? It's kind of funny. I don't know why people are so fucking sensitive nowadays. Maybe you're an asshole.

The woman was washing her feet when suddenly her neighbor walked in. Upon seeing the boy, Anna quickly straightened her clothes. However, Jack, who was in his puberty, was instantly drawn to Anna's sexy and hot figure the moment he saw it. After a moment, he ran away shyly. Even until he went to bed that night, Anna's image kept lingering in his mind. Anna was the most beautiful woman in the small town. Everywhere she went, her sexy figure always attracted men's attention. Her husband, Fusco, was proud of this. He always dressed Anna up beautifully, making other men jealous. One Day Fascio had to go out on a business trip and might not come back for several months. Before leaving, he specially called their neighbor Jack to his home, asking Jack to take care of his wife. Soon Fascio left, although Anna was very reluctant to let him go. She could only see him off in silence. While her husband was away, Jack often helped Anna solve problems. Since his mother had passed away early, Jack had always had a soft spot for mature women. He thought Anna was extremely beautiful and often stared at her in a daze. At first, Anna treated Jack like a child, but as they spent more time together, she developed a fondness for him. However, bound by her marriage, she could only turn a blind eye to this feeling. One day, Jack got sand in his eye. When Anna saw this, she took the initiative to help Jack clean it. Looking at Anna, who was so close to him, Jack couldn't help but kiss her. Anna froze, recalling that she already had a family. She ran out in a fluster. After this incident, Jack understood Anna's thoughts.

Laura was shocked for she was not only the mother of the boy's friend, but also the boy's teacher. When Laura saw Jack was injured, she thoughtfully helped him clean his wound. Just then and her husband came back. He was too tired from work, so he asked Laura to send Jack home. Little did he know this would just create a chance for the two of them to be alone together. On the way home, Jack boldly reached out his hand to Laura this time Laura did not refuse. The two became intimate with each other. Laura was a Chinese, his language teacher. Though she was over 40, she still retained her charm. Her husband was the only pastor in town, deeply loved and respected by the villagers. Because he was too busy with work, he often ignored Laura's feelings. Laura often felt lonely. She had thought this lonely life would last forever, until the day Jack, a new transfer student, appeared and changed everything. One day, Laura was driving home from work when she saw Jack sitting alone by the roadside. She thought he might have run into trouble, so she got out of the car and went over to ask. But little did she expect, before they could say a few words, Jack boldly kissed her. Laura was shocked at once, but she did not scold Jack, her lonely heart had found a little comfort in that moment's action. After returning home, Laura was still immersed in that feeling from earlier, unable to pull herself out of it. That night, Laura had wanted to be intimate with her husband, but unexpectedly, he refused.

This old man wanted to take possession of an 18 year old girl. Did not hesitate to marry the girl's mother just to get close to her. On the wedding day, Amy noticed that the man was staring at her with a strange look. She felt a little uneasy in her heart. Since it was her mother's wedding day, she finally chose to keep silent. What drew Amy's attention even more was that her uncle didn't come to the wedding. But her mother, who was immersed in joy at this moment. Didn't notice at all that someone was missing. Little did she know that the man had already killed her uncle. One day, Amy saw the man talking to a turned off computer. The atmosphere was very weird. In fact, the man suffered from a mental illness. He always thought that someone was stopping him from pursuing love. Amy couldn't help but ask the man who he was talking to. But the man said he was practicing a drama script. He even told Amy I love you on the spot. Amy thought there was something wrong with the man. She wanted to warn her mother. But at this time, her mother's mind was full of going on a honeymoon with the man. Helplessly, Amy had to give up. The man took his wife on their honeymoon. However, the place he chose was a desolate suburban area. This couldn't help but make people suspect that the man had ulterior motives. At the same time, Amy found many newspapers in the man's room. The newspapers were about how to murder one's wife. She immediately felt something was wrong. She quickly called her mother, but no one answered.

I think Georgie's following me. Some goon almost ran me off the road. Look, I want. Jax's protecting me. When Layla tried to be friendly, Jax coldly turned around and walked away. The manager went straight to Jax. Because of those damn sales numbers. She's got a thing for you. Calm her down. She's our biggest draw right now. In the end, Jax had no choice but to agree to what Layla wanted. Clay and Gamma's heated argument shattered the peace. Desperate, Tara could only turn to Jax for help. He's occupied, honey. You should wait outside like you were told. Tara couldn't believe what was happening right before her eyes. But time was running out, so they rushed away from the scene. The next day, Jack showed up at the club entrance with Layla. This devastating moment happened to catch Tara's eye. You good with that, brother? On Jack's educate. But she firmly believed Jax would never betray her. She refused to use violence to solve the problem. I'm not 18 years old anymore, Gemma. My cat fighting days are behind me. You'll see. When night fell, the studio turned into a private party spot. Tara came face to face with Jax. I'm looking for Layla. Once again. I said, get Out! That's right, you heard her. What part of that is so complicated? Get out my face! Jax sensed danger and immediately rushed over. Tara's anger was already out of control as she stormed toward the bathroom. Jax knew damn well that Tara was pissed. He followed her, trying to use work as an excuse to explain. Did they get to you? Tara completely lost it. She angrily tore at Jax's clothes, letting out all her inner pain. At that crucial moment, the bathroom door got pushed open. Layla stared in shock at the scene in front of her. Tara looked at her with a knowing smile spreading across her face. Retries

The fuck, man? Fuck! Psycho. Wait. Yellowstone. Are you being man about it? Don't scream. Jimmy had just arrived at Yellowstone. And rip branded him with the Mark. His grandfather reached out to John, asking him to look after the lost and broken. Jimmy, you know where the ranch is? That brand was the Mark of Yellowstone's inner circle. Not everyone was worthy of it. Start Monday. After his first day, Jimmy was so exhausted he could barely move. A ranch hand told him to get in the shower. But Jimmy said he'd go later. Seeing the chance, the ranch hand decided to teach him a lesson. It's like you're taking that shower now. I'm going. Get the fuck off. Get off! Get the cold water. Don't bother me now. That's the rule at Yellowstone. Anyone with the brand is one of them. No one dares to touch him. The next day after work, while Jimmy was walking down the road, that same man tripped him. Jimmy refused to back down, even though he knew he couldn't win. He ended up on the ground. And that's when rip showed up. What's the rule about fighting, Fred? You wanna fight somebody, you come fight me. I'll fight you all goddamn day.

The boy nearby started to become restless. He tried to imitate his father. He wanted to comfort his mother. The stepmother thought it was a prank, but the boy thought he had received approval. The next second, he made an even bolder move. After that, he would sneak and watch the nightly fights between his stepmother and father. One. One day, Lacey was lying in bed. Suddenly, she noticed there was a small hole in the ceiling. Through the hole, she could perfectly see her bed. Lacey knew it must have been the boy's doing. She immediately went over to confront him. To her surprise, the boy boldly admitted to spying. He even said he really liked Lacey. He even mentioned that he often watched his real mother. The boy's words shocked Lacey. She began to suspect that her real mother's death was suspicious. She then demanded the boy tell the truth. But to her surprise, the boy was completely unreasonable. He said that Lacey could ask him one question, and for every question, he had to open a snack wrapper to get to the truth. Lacy agreed to his request. It turned out that years ago, the boy's spying had been exposed. He was severely scolded by his mother. Afterward, the boy became increasingly angry as he thought about it. In his anger, he turned his mother into a mermaid. Lacy was stunned upon learning the truth. She couldn't believe how malicious the Boy had become terrified. She hurriedly ran out of the room. The boy had one more plan. He was planning to kill his father and replace him. Lacy threw a toy forcefully. The boy quickly chased after her.

We gotta cut it out. How old are you? Eight. And he swallowed something stuck to a fridge. Darwin says let him die. It's already below the stomach. Should pass on its own. Strong magnet. It's messing with the imaging. We have no way that you got X ray Vision, House. Whoa, whoa. You're gonna cut him open right here. It's well into the intestines. He's fine. I want my 50 back. I need a crash card, stat. What happened? Pills, benzos. We need to get her stomach pumped. Where's Bryce? And shallow. What did you say to her? Nothing that would make her want to hurt herself. Heart pizza. Regular. What did she say to you? Nothing. I gave her a couple sedatives, turned around, she grabbed the whole bottle. You must have said something. I said plenty. She said nothing. I was with her for over an hour. She didn't say one word. Try to kill yourself because you couldn't talk to me? You must have a reason to be a reason. Can't we just talk? Here's a phone. Talk to a friend, family member, call the police. You wanna talk about what happened to you? No. Wanna talk about your STD meds? No. You don't really seem to wanna talk. No, I do. About what? I don't know. Anything. The weather. You were raped and you wanna talk about the weather? Yeah. I'm not gonna talk to you about the weather. You help her. She wants you. God knows why. She doesn't know what she wants. She knows she wants you. You're the first person she spoke to about this. The fact that I was in the wrong place at the wrong time, she'd be trumped by the fact that I'm useless at this. No, you're not. You romantically wanting to believe that is never gonna make it true. I'm agreeing with you. You are the last person she should be talking to. She wants to talk about the weather. Talk about the weather? She wants normalcy. She wants to feel like the world didn't end. Right? I'll tell her that everything went on without her. Babies were born, people got married. Thousands of people will remember the day she got raped is the happiest day of their life. You might not want to phrase it quite that way. You need to get her to talk about what happened. No, he doesn't. Pretending it didn't happen. Wrong. Pretending this didn't happen is the best thing she could possibly do. She's gotta make this real. You know, we should be trying to make real a process. The few decent moments in our lives, not the crap. Maybe you're right. Except there's no way She can pretend this didn't happen. So she has no choice but to process it.

And he's what, 14 now? He'll be 15 in 11 months. That's even worse. My six year old daughter hits the ball farther than him, okay? And he's. Well, it's not his fault. He's a late bloomer. Oh, it's not my fault that he can't hit the broadside of a barn. I, I just don't understand. He's way better than Carmichael. Well, actually, Carmichael's hitting 3, 15 on the summer, which is pretty good. Now Timmy has more sliding hits than he has hits on the entire summer. So. Well, Carmichael's mom's a bitch. I don't really agree with your coaching strategies. Well, you know, that's ironic giving the fact that somehow I have more state championship rings than you've had affairs. So I say that's pretty impressive. You know, I'll be honest, Jennifer, I think we'd have a better shot if we put a fucking mannequin at second base instead of having Timmy there. All right.

Basically just anyone wearing a commanders Jersey. And Jack decided to find the two smallest commanders fans who were just standing there doing nothing, and knocked this guy out. But he gives this guy a right hook for no reason and started randomly assaulting this other guy, in which, after the fact, he starts flexing and says that I don't fucking lose. And that viral video was even liked by Lamar Jackson. But NFL fans really didn't like this move, so they decided to ruin this guy's life. They first found his Facebook page, where it listed his job. And once that happened, everyone else started chiming in with their stories about it, like this guy saying, I knew this kid throughout high school. He's a total piece of shit. Got kicked out of three different Baltimore private schools. And a notable moment was his expulsion from Saint Paul's for putting his hmm. On a kid with special needs. He's disgusting, but his father's absolutely loaded, super rich. His expulsion story should tell you.

He was top 10 in passing in the Big 12. But yesterday was just announced that Jake is transferring from BYU because he got suspended for violating the honor code. This is all happening because Jake has an ongoing lawsuit where a Jane Doe alleges that Jake hmm her and also strangled her, which, of course, is a very serious accusation in and of itself. But here's where things get pretty interesting, and it's a lose lose for Jake. First and foremost, if he did do that, and that story is true, he deserves everything that's coming to him. But Jake is saying that he did not hmm her, and everything that they did was 100% consensual. But because he is saying that it was consensual, he is admitting to having premarital activities, which is a direct violation of BYU's Code of honor because Mormon. Though on top of the ongoing lawsuit that's happening, he's also getting suspended from BYU because he admitted to having these premarital activities. Apparently, this all happened in November of 2023, and then in February of 2024, they were exchanging light hearted.

So basically, stopped showing up to practice and meetings and was holding out hoping that Tennessee would give him four million dollars. Long story short, Tennessee said no. I mean, to be fair, Nico, like Tennessee's mascot, is the volunteers. He kind of knew what you signed up for. All jokes aside, though, this is kind of an insane move. And to me, the only logical explanation behind this is that Nico's camp just thinks he's not gonna succeed in the NFL. So they're trying to get him as much money as possible right now. And if that

So today, we're gonna be talking about the UMHB Crusaders down in Texas. It's the university of Mary Hardin Baylor, which is a Christian university and a D3 school. But yesterday, they posted this picture to X, which was their team GPA. The team had a GPA average of 2.72, with 15 players having a perfect 4.0 and 51 players having a 3.5 or above. Now, at first look, you're like, 66 players with the GPA over 3.5. Like, that's good. But then that left us with some questions. If 66 players on the team have really good GPS, how did you get such a low average? Now, for what it's worth, a team GPS that is good is considered 2.3 or higher. So this 2.72, not too bad. Then people started to do some digging on this team. They found that the UMHB Crusader football team has 192 players. 192! There are 18 quarterbacks on this football team.

So this man right here is Shamar Stewart from Texas a M. He was drafted 17th overall by the Bengals this year. But Shamar here is the only first round pick to not have signed his rookie contract yet because the Bengals are trying to shaft him. this dispute happening with Shamar in the Bengals isn't about money. He's a first round pick. He gets 18, almost $19 million fully guaranteed on his rookie contract. But the reason he's not signing is cause the Bengals tried to sneak in a little clause in the contract. And this clause that they try to sneak in there was saying that if he gets in any trouble, this is a very blanket term, they can void all future guarantees on his contract. So his agent is telling him, no, you're not gonna sign that. And he hasn't practiced at all with the team and he's actually been practicing with Texas a m. And Shamar here could really mess things up for the NFL because 1, he could go back to college football. That would probably involve a lawsuit because the NCAA doesn't allow people who were drafted to go play back at college football again. It's possible but not likely. Number two.

It's early in the season. Friday Night Lights. Alvin takes the field to win this game versus Mackenzie. Alvin had 40 carries for 435 fucking yards and 10 touchdowns. 435 yards and 10 touchdowns. Some kids don't even do this in a season. If I started NCAA 25 and put Georgia versus Toledo, I don't think I could do this. So seeing that he had 40 carries for 435 yards and 10 touchdowns, you're probably like, damn, they must have beat the shit out of the other team, right? Yeah. So, uh, no. They lost the game. The final score of this high school football game was 80 to 78. 158 points scored in a single game. Now, granted, this game did go into overtime, but 158 points in one game is preposterous. But with this performance, Alvin set the state.

And then third string, they got Trey Lance. Now if you remember a couple seconds ago, I said that the second string quarterback was Cooper Rush and Cooper's been leading the team since Dak got hurt.

And in Cooper's contract, there was a clause that said if he plays 45% of the snaps, he'll get 250 grand. Now thankfully Cooper has gotten that 250 k as he sets At 52.3% of the snaps played this year. But there's another incentive that says if he plays 55% of this.

But he gives this guy a right hook for no reason and started randomly assaulting this other guy in which after the fact he starts flexing and says that I don't fucking lose. And that viral video was even liked by Lamar Jackson. But NFL fans really didn't like this move, so they decided to ruin this guy's life. They first found his Facebook page where it listed his job. And once that happened, everyone else started chiming in with their stories about it. Like this guy saying, I knew this kid throughout high school. He's a total piece of shit. Got kicked out of three different Baltimore private schools. And a notable moment was his expulsion from Saint Paul's for putting his hmm on a kid with special needs. He's disgusting, but his father's absolutely loaded, super rich. His expulsion story should tell you all you need to know. But it gets so Much worse. He was once on pro.

So if you don't know who this man is, his name is Jerry Jones and he owns the Dallas Cowboys. And if you want to know his net worth, just take the biggest number that you can think of, multiply that by 2 / 4 and then multiply it by 7 again. The point is Jerry's got a shit ton of money, right? The guy shows up to cowboys practices in his private helicopter. They created a damn AI generated hologram of it. But what he did today takes the cake. So on Jerry's roster, he's got three quarterbacks, right? First you got the main man Dak Prescott, who unfortunately is out for the season with a hamstring injury. You then got QB two, who's Cooper Rush, who's been playing all year since Dak got hurt. And then third string, they got Trey Lance. Now if you remember a couple seconds ago, I said that the second string quarterback was Cooper Rush and Cooper's been leading the team since Dak got hurt. And although he hasn't been the best, he's got him a couple wins. But today is the last week of the regular season in the NFL, which means a lot of contract incentives are on the line. And in Cooper's contract, there was a clause that said if he plays 45% of the snaps, he'll get 250 grand. Now thankfully Cooper has gotten that 250 k as he sets At 52.3% of the snaps played this year. But there's another incentive that says if he plays 55% of the snaps, he'll get another 250.

The 13 year old boy used a slingshot to save his sister from the kidnappers, but he was sued by the kidnappers and taken to court demanding compensation of eight thousand thousand dollars from the boy's mother. On May 10th, 13 year old Owen Burns from Michigan heard his sister's plea for help while playing video games at home. He then saw a 17 year old Terrence Coleman kidnap his 8 year old sister and drag her into the woods. He quickly grabbed the slingshot, loaded it with marbles and both of his shots hit the kidnappers. Due to pain, the kidnapper released his sister and fled the scene. It is reported that Terrence first suffered a chest injury and the severe pain made him mistakenly believe that he had been shot. Owen fired another shot, this time hitting Terence's eye and successfully saving his sister. Afterwards, Terence's family filed a lawsuit against Owen's mother because the doctor informed Terence that his right eye will be permanently blind. Terrence's family insists that he was just playing with the girl, not kidnapping. They claim that Owen caused Terrence to go blind for no reason and demand compensation of eight thousand thousand dollars. This case is still under investigation.

But after a judge sentenced him to 13 years in prison, when it was time to go to jail, no police came to get him. He didn't try to run away because he knew he deserved it. So he just nervously waited in his house, expecting police to show up at any moment. But, but after a few weeks had passed, they never came. So he thought they may have just cleared his record. So over the next few years, he moved on with his life, completely forgetting about the incident. He got married, launched a construction company and volunteered to help youth avoid making the same mistakes he made. But 13 years later, he was shocked when police suddenly arrived at his house to arrest him. It turns out because of a technical issue, police thought he was in jail for the last 13 years. But when they went to release him, they realized he wasn't there. So they sent police to immediately arrest him.

Got chalked at 8:30. I came back at 12:30. The truck marks are still on it. So I wrote it for a two hour violation. But Brennan is violating the Constitution Michigan who argued that marking tires is similar to police secretly putting a GPS on a vehicle without a proper warrant. That's a violation of the 4th Amendment right against unreasonable searches. I don't mind at all. I think it's a chalk wipes off very, very easily. So it's not a problem. The court, which covers four Midwest states, ruled that now a warrant is needed because the purpose of marking tires is to raise revenue and not for public safety. Ken Kissell, who owns Livewire Security in Irvington, says the chalking keeps three spots open for customers. So somebody can run in, run out and not have to worry about getting a ticket for just being parked for 5 minutes like you do with a lot of other towns that have parking meters. In the meantime, the village is considering more high tech options.

After she pushed the suspect to the ground, her daughter also ran over and helped hold him down until the police arrived. And she did a good job.

A customer was dissatisfied with the temperature of the spicy soup and poured boiling soup onto the cashier, causing serious injuries to the cashier. At present, the victim has filed a lawsuit seeking compensation of $3 million. Thirty one year old Amanda Nicole Martinez previously ordered a takeout menu soup to bring home. Subsequently, she angrily returned to the store, claiming that the temperature of the soup was too high and that the plastic from the takeaway box had melted and fallen into the soup. Twenty four year old cashier Janelle Broland processed a refund for her and offered to replace her soup, but Amanda refused to listen and constantly insulted Janelle in front of her children and other customers. Janelle remained calm and demanded that Amanda stop insulting and leave, otherwise she would call the police. Suddenly, the customer poured almost boiling soup onto Janelle's face. After Janelle realized it, she immediately ran to wash it off, but the hot soup had caused severe burns to her face and blood was flowing from her nose and eyes. Afterwards, the police went to Amanda's residence and arrested her. During the trial, Amanda refused to plead guilty and was released later that day after paying a fine of $800.

All of this happened in front of their five month old child who witnessed the entire scene but was powerless to intervene, leaving an indelible traumatic memory. The man is 31 year old Zach Stacy, a former New York Jets running back. Later he was only sentenced to one month in prison after admitting to the crime of criminal injury. The newly exposed video shows the severity of the incident where they had a heated argument over a rent payment issue. His wife Kristen Evans attempted to escape, but he chased after her and used a trash can to smash the car, even grabbing the car's wiper. According to a home surveillance video, Zack first hit Evans twice on the back of the head with an unidentified object and picked him up and threw him heavily towards the TV. Please, please, please. Evans can be heard constantly pleading with him to stop. Even in front of their 5 month old child, Zack continues to commit violence. Afterwards, Evans said in an interview that she didn't want Zach to stay in prison for even a day. No one wants to send their son's father to prison. Zach was charged with serious assault and criminal damage and sentenced to one month in prison. At present, this mother and son are receiving psychological and legal support. Do you think he should not go to jail?

A customer was dissatisfied with the temperature of the spicy soup and poured boiling soup onto the cashier causing serious injuries to the cashier. At present, the victim has filed a lawsuit seeking compensation of $3 million. Thirty one year old Amanda Nicole Martinez previously ordered a take out menu soup to bring home. Subsequently, she angrily returned to the store claiming that the temperature of the soup was too high and that the plastic from the takeaway box had melted and fallen into the soup. Twenty four year old cashier Janelle Broland processed a refund for her and offered to replace her soup, but Amanda refused to listen and constantly insulted Janelle in front of her children and other customers. Janelle remained calm and demanded that Amanda stop insulting and leave. Otherwise she would call the police. Suddenly, the customer poured almost boiling soup onto Janelle's face. After Janelle realized it, she immediately ran to wash it off. But the hot soup had caused severe burns to her face and blood was flowing from her nose and eyes. Afterwards, the police went to Amanda's residence and arrested her. During the trial, Amanda refused to plead guilty and was released later that day after paying a fine of $800.

When they were about to release him, they realized he wasn't there at all. So they immediately sent police to arrest him.

A customer was dissatisfied with the temperature of the spicy soup and poured boiling soup onto the cashier causing serious injuries to the cashier. At present, the victim has filed a lawsuit seeking compensation of $3 million. Thirty one year old Amanda Nicole Martinez previously ordered a take out menu soup to bring home. Subsequently, she angrily returned to the store claiming that the temperature of the soup was too high and that the plastic from the takeaway box had melted and fallen into the soup. Twenty four year old cashier Janelle Broland processed a refund for her and offered to replace her soup, but Amanda refused to listen and constantly insulted Janelle in front of her children and other customers. Janelle remained calm and demanded that Amanda stop insulting and leave. Otherwise she would call the police. Suddenly, the customer poured almost boiling soup onto Janelle's face. After Janelle realized it, she immediately ran to wash it off. But the hot soup had caused severe burns to her face and blood was flowing from her nose and eyes. Afterwards, the police went to Amanda's residence and arrested her. During the trial, Amanda refused to plead guilty and was released later that day after paying a fine of $800.

Did you come clean today? And I was like, yeah, I came and cleaned. Like I'm sitting in your living room right now. Um, your cat's on my lap. I'm playing with your cat. Uh, Louis. I was like, yeah. He's like, I don't have a cat. Yep. Louis had just spent a lot of elbow grease cleaning the wrong apartment. This apartment is 2, 77. You were in two, 20, 27. Yes. And you had already finished cleaning the entire place? Exactly. Just so happens both places had keys under the mat. This is the apartment Louis mistakenly cleaned. The homeowner was so shocked. Somebody broke in and cleaned our apartment.

Subsequently, she angrily returned to the store claiming that the temperature of the soup was too high and that the plastic from the takeaway box had melted and fallen into the soup. Twenty four year old cashier Janelle Broland processed a refund for her and offered to replace her soup, but Amanda refused to listen and constantly insulted Janelle in front of her children and other customers. Janelle remained calm and demanded that Amanda stop insulting and leave. Otherwise she would call the police. Suddenly, the customer poured almost boiling soup onto Janelle's face. After Janelle realized it, she immediately ran to wash it off. But the hot soup had caused severe burns to her face and blood was flowing from her nose and eyes. Afterwards, the police went to Amanda's residence and arrested her. During the trial, Amanda refused to plead guilty and was released later that day after paying a fine of $800.

But the next morning, he got a shocking call from the army sergeant. Turns out he accidentally broke the pull up record, and now the army wanted him to enlist. Since he wasn't doing great in school, his parents actually agreed and sent him to basic training, which meant he had just five days before being transferred to a real military base. But instead of panicking, he came up with the funniest escape plan ever. For the first two days, he quietly watched the sergeants taking notes on each recruit. How many push UPS they could do, how fast they ran, everything. He noticed they kept all the records in a small office near the dorms. So one night, he snuck in and edited the notes. On the final day, he intentionally bombed the pull up test. The sergeant was confused. This was the same kid and who crushed the record back at school. But then the guy told him he must be confusing him with his identical twin brother, Tay. When the sergeant checked the school notes, sure enough, Tay was now listed as the pull up champ. So they sent the guy home. But later that week, Tay got a surprise call from the army.

A customer was dissatisfied with the temperature of the spicy soup and poured boiling soup onto the cashier causing serious injuries to the cashier. At present, the victim has filed a lawsuit seeking compensation of $3 million. Thirty one year old Amanda Nicole Martinez previously ordered a take out menu soup to bring home. Subsequently, she angrily returned to the store claiming that the temperature of the soup was too high and that the plastic from the takeaway box had melted and fallen into the soup. Twenty four year old cashier Janelle Broland processed a refund for her and offered to replace her soup, but Amanda refused to listen and constantly insulted Janelle in front of her children and other customers. Janelle remained calm and demanded that Amanda stop insulting and leave. Otherwise she would call the police. Suddenly, the customer poured almost boiling soup onto Janelle's face. After Janelle realized it, she immediately ran to wash it off. But the hot soup had caused severe burns to her face and blood was flowing from her nose and eyes. Afterwards, the police went to Amanda's residence and arrested her. During the trial, Amanda refused to plead guilty and was released later that day after paying a fine of $800.

Got chalked at 8:30. I came back at 12:30. The truck marks are still on it. So I wrote it for a two hour violation. But Brennan is violating the Constitution Michigan who argued that marking tires is similar to police secretly putting a GPS on a vehicle without a proper warrant. That's a violation of the 4th Amendment right against unreasonable searches. I don't mind at all. I think it's a chalk wipes off very, very easily. So it's not a problem. The court, which covers four Midwest states, ruled that now a warrant is needed because the purpose of marking tires is to raise revenue and not for public safety. Ken Kissell, who owns Livewire Security in Irvington, says the chalking keeps three spots open for customers. So somebody can run in, run out and not have to worry about getting a ticket for just being parked for 5 minutes like you do with a lot of other towns that have parking meters. In the meantime, the village is considering more high tech options.

And there's a vulnerability with the point of sale machines that he was able to exploit and get basically double his money. He would, uh, do a transaction that was canceled about halfway through and by the end of it, the point of sale machine would give him double his money back. And he would leave posted information how to trick the Walmart checkout machines into giving cash back on certain types of purchases. Police say in south metro Atlanta, this guy apparently was not the only one observed doing it.

Got chalked at 8:30. I came back at 12:30. The truck marks are still on it. So I wrote it for a two hour violation. But Brennan is violating the Constitution Michigan who argued that marking tires is similar to police secretly putting a GPS on a vehicle without a proper warrant. That's a violation of the 4th Amendment right against unreasonable searches. I don't mind at all. I think it's a chalk wipes off very, very easily. So it's not a problem. The court, which covers four Midwest states, ruled that now a warrant is needed because the purpose of marking tires is to raise revenue and not for public safety. Ken Kissell, who owns Livewire Security in Irvington, says the chalking keeps three spots open for customers. So somebody can run in, run out and not have to worry about getting a ticket for just being parked for 5 minutes like you do with a lot of other towns that have parking meters. In the meantime, the village is considering more high tech options.

So back in 2015, Hard Rock Stadium underwent a 500 million dollar renovation so they could host events like the Super Bowl. However, they designed it in a way for the Miami Dolphins to win more football games. The worst problem with the old stadium was how hot it would get. The Dolphins have by far the warmest stadium in football. The average home game is about 75 degrees and early in the season it could be over 100. The old stadium had no shade. So to solve that, they added an open air canopy to make it cooler. But what many people don't know is that it's not shady for everyone. The stadium was made so that the opposing team sideline would be directly in the sun during day games and the Dolphins are perfectly in the shade. This makes a massive difference. Last season, the Vikings sideline when they came to Miami was 30 degrees hotter than the Dolphins. There's was 120 degrees compared to the Dolphins 90. On top of all that, the Dolphins, unlike most teams, force the opposing team to wear darker uniforms while they wear white. They do that to make them sweat in the sun even more.

So from Super Bowl 1 in 1967 all the way until the 90s, the NFL never spent more than $1,000 a year getting the field ready for the big game. And the whole process would only take about a week. But now the Super Bowl is a billion dollar event and over 100 million people are going to watch it. So that's why the NFL now spends nearly two years preparing the grass for each Super Bowl. And what's interesting is the grass being used this year may be an advantage for the Forty Niners. So for Super Bowl 57 last year in Scottsdale, Arizona, the grass was grown at a local farm for 18 months. Then a few weeks before the game, it was brought to the stadium where it would sit outside in the sun during the day and then rolled into the stadium at night to avoid the cold. The cost last year was $800,000. But if you remember, the field was actually terrible. Players on both teams were slipping everywhere. It was a disaster. They had to replace their cleats. So will it be better this year? Well, the grass from this Super Bowl is coming.

Nah, I can't right now. Your mom says I have too many. We'd have to sell one. Easy. Sell your civic. The hell. Why don't I just sell you then, dad? What's the big deal? It's a freaking Honda Civic. You got all these super cars, yet you keep that civic in the showroom. Why? Cause I can. Cause it's funny. Cause I want to you realize without that civic, we wouldn't have any of this today. I'd sell any of these cars in a heartbeat before selling that civic. Call me crazy, but I'm nostalgic that way. It's not even a type R. It's just a Si. Yeah, it's one of the most famous Civic Si's to exist. When I was 18, I had people from Australia telling me it was their favorite car. It's a symbol of worldwide respect and unification, bro. Why you think I got modism plastered on the windshield? Alright, jeez, I get it. Sorry I asked. Nah, homie, you gotta learn respect and appreciation. Since you want another car, why don't you sell your car? No, it's my first car. I'm keeping that thing forever. Yeah, same thing with my civic. It was my first car. I'm not selling it. Just the Si. Get a load of this guy. It's a Si with the Type R motor pushing 5 hundo, bro. Oh, for real? Can I drive it? Heck no, man. After all the BS you said Here, I. I'm sorry, dad. I didn't think about it like that. Everything.

You ever seen that video of those three GT3 RS lined up, then they all start going and then take off? Oh yeah, the video is pretty sick. Well, that sound you heard is launch control, but what's it do? Well, as the name suggests, it controls your launch so you get the best launch possible. Wait, but don't you just floor it to take off? If you over Rev it, your tires can spin out leading to a bad launch. If you under Rev it, you're not gonna have enough power to launch the car, also leading to a bad launch. There's a perfect sweet spot in your RPMs as ideal for launching at this point. You're not over revving it and you're not under revving it is just right like Goldilocks and the three bears. Yeah, exactly like that. Launch control is when your car's computer limits the RPMs when you're at a standstill. That way you as the driver don't have to worry about over revving or under revving. You trust in the launch control and then you take off. It helps out a ton in racing, which is why it usually comes in a lot of sportier cars. But the cool thing is there are cars that don't come with it, but you could tune it in after as a feature. So is this only for automatics or could you do launch control in a manual? No, there are some manuals That have been tuned to have launch control. It's not common, but it's possible. Huh? Cool. What about two stepping? Is that the same thing? No, it's not. We'll get into that next time.

What's the cheap, easy mod that I could do to unlock some extra horsepower? But what do you have in your car already? Nothing. It's bone stock. The cheapest and easiest thing you can do is toss on an aftermarket intake. Really? And that'll make my car go faster. Yeah, but not by much. How does that even work though? Okay, so the basics of an engine, you got air, fuel and spark. Those three things are the basic principles of an engine. Okay, with modern cars like the Subaru WRX, you actually don't need an aftermarket intake unless you're trying to make big numbers. But since you're trying to mod a car from the 90s, I assume the factory airbox is kind of restrictive and that's a problem. Why can you breathe better with one or two nostrils? 2. Exactly. Your factory airbox is like breathing through one nostril when you should be doing it with two. If your car is not getting enough oxygen, the fuel is not gonna be burning as efficiently, meaning there's still some extra potential to be unlocked. Oh, I get it now. When you toss on the aftermarket intake, the car gets more adequate oxygen, therefore the fuel burns more efficiently. And because of that, your car is able to squeeze out some extra horses. So I can just toss any intake on my car. Well, you have options.

What exactly are they doing, and how do I do it to my car? Well, first of all, you absolutely don't need it on your car, but I'll tell you how it works. Okay, fair enough. So, NOS stands for Nitrous Oxide System. You remember those blue bottles they would show hidden in the trunk or under the seats? Yeah. Looked pretty cool. Well, those are NOS bottles, and inside those bottles, it's nitrous oxide, but in its liquid form. Often times, people think NOS is a different type of gasoline that makes your car go faster. Wait, it's not? No, but it does work in unison with your gasoline. Wait, dad, I'm kind of confused. Well, remember the basic principles of an engine? Air, fuel, spark, and compression. Yeah, I got that. Well, some people have their system set up so when they hit that button, it shoots nitrous into the cylinders or into the intake manifold. And again, it's liquid when it's in the bottle, but when it goes into the engine, it's no longer liquid. So it's air. Yeah, exactly. It's boost, but without turbochargers or superchargers. Of course, you can still run nitrous on boosted car.

You drive a manual, your car does have one clutch. This one right here got two. Wait, I'm confused. Is it an automatic or a manual? Well, automatic cars have torque converters. The M4 over there doesn't use torque converter. So it's a manual. Yeah, kind of sorta. Think of it as an automatic manual. Wait, wait, wait, hold up. You're kind of losing me here. What do you mean it's a automatic manual. So it has a computer to help it predict which gear comes next, like an automatic, right? Uh huh. But the way the transmission is set up is more similar to that of a manual. Wait, so what's the purpose of having two clutches then? Well, these two clutches overlap one another. This allows both clutches to work on the same input shaft. Same shaft, technically two, but they do overlap each other. Not only that, but the gears operate on piston powered shift forks. Dad, I'm hearing what you're saying, but what does all that mumbo jumbo mean? That means you could shift extremely fast. So how do I know if a car is DCT? If you hear a really aggressive and quick shift, that's a DCT. Some of them have paddles.

His domestic partner is also there. Everything is fine. And then suddenly a piece of jewelry went missing and they allegedly blamed the 16 year old. That is when the two of them tortured this girl for at least 4 days, ending her life with a billiard ball down her throat over jewelry. His name is Steven Grass. He is 35. And she is Michelle Brandis. She's 37. And most importantly, this is Miranda Corset. Miranda had been on a dating website. When she met Steve, they started talking and he invited her over to the house. Everything went fine that first day and she goes back home. She had been living with her grandmother because both of her parents have passed away and she also has an 11 month old baby. So the following day she decides to go back over to their home and she never came home. And unfortunately, because she has frequently just left and not came back, the grandma didn't report it because she assumed she just went off again, which is honestly so awful in itself. So she then goes back. She's at their home. That's when the jewelry goes missing. That's when they torture her. That's when they take her life. And then the two of them dismember her and throw her in a freaking trash can. Right now the police believe that her Body is in a landfill because of her history. This is not taken seriously. I don't understand how anyone could do this to anyone for literally any reason. As of now, they are charged and they are sitting in a jail cell. And I hope Miranda receives justice. And I am begging every teenager, learn from her mistake that she did not get the chance to learn from.

Michael seemed like a quiet boy, but every day he would walk into a small grocery store in Texas with his backpack. This recurring behavior soon aroused the suspicion of the clerk, Sarah. Her concerns prompt at her to start observing him more closely and discreetly. Whenever he entered the store, Sarah noticed Michael buying multiple packs of baby wipes daily, far more than any child his age could possibly need. No boy his age would require that many wipes, especially every single day. She instantly sensed something was terribly wrong, breaking out in a cold sweat. Convinced something was amiss with this boy, she made a bold decision. One evening, after Michael left the grocery store, Sarah quietly followed him. After walking for about 10 minutes, Michael suddenly stopped in a deserted area. What Sarah saw next shocked her deeply. She immediately pulled out her phone to call the police, only demanding that Michael be locked up for life. What Michael did with those wipes will leave you speechless. Follow me and type wipes in the comments to watch part 2. What do you think he did with the wipes? Share your guesses in the comments below.

Before we even got into the park, it cost me $30 just for parking. And even being a Florida resident, tickets for a family of five with one child under 10 was still $974. The rest of the family decided they want to go to dinner at Downtown Disney Springs. This place was my literal hell. Totaling two hundred and forty five dollars twenty seven cents. The grand total for our day was one thousand three hundred ninety one dollars. Ninety one cents. I kind of had a feeling it would go viral. It's very relatable. It's family friendly. Disney's always a hot topic and we're, we're all trying to pinch pennies. So that video was probably my therapy as I was going through the day. The kids were smiling, sometimes fighting in between the lines. My wife was having a grand old time. Meanwhile, mine was just swipe the card over and over and over. And it started with the tik get purchase and then it ran right into the parking and then it just was like a cash cow for the rest of the day. So I kind of had an idea that people would be able to relate to it, just maybe not so much.

Does there always have to be a winner? This little paper had just finished school and this was always her scariest time of day. To get out of the school gate, she had to walk past the Scissors. Seeing all those scary little Scissors, paper was so terrified she could barely move. She kept her head down and hurried toward the gate. Finally, she spotted some classmates ahead. She thought she could walk home with them, but when she got closer, they were her enemies. The bullies picked on her, spat gum at her, pushed little paper to the ground, flipped her upside down, even called over Scissors to join in the bully. Little paper squeezed her eyes shut in fear. But when she opened them again, only her and one little scissor were left. The three bullies had run off and tear. Turns out that little scissor had come to help her after all. She politely offered to walk paper home. But halfway there, they ran into another bully, rocks. Two big rocks were picking on a tiny rock. It was such a terrible sight. Little scissor have been bullied by them too. She stood there trembling with fear. Then little paper shouted for them to stop and slowly walked forward, standing behind the tiny rock. When the bully rocks saw paper appear, they freaked out and ran off. Right away, the tiny rock turned around, amazed to see that Miss Paper had saved him. He Was touched. In a little shock, he gathered up his things, then called Little Scissor over to say thanks. The tiny rock even gave him a little flower. From that day on, the three of them became inseparable, best friends.

But officials warned that it'd actually be a terrible idea. Thirty years after the statue arrived in America, a devastating fire at a nearby military ammunition depot caused a massive blast that severely damaged its interior, preventing any future public access to the torch. That same year, the statue turned fully green as its original copper brown finished oxidizing deferred it. Now, less than a year before the nation's 250th anniversary, some are calling for a major restoration of the statue by first using lasers to grip the green layer, exposing the original copper brown underneath, and then completely reworking the upper internal structure to reopen access to the torch. But government officials say this would be one of the dumbest ways to waste taxpayer money as not only would the copper simply reoxidize after less than 10 years, it would also cause irreparable damage to Lady Liberty as the green layer is actually preventing the statue from corroding.

So we saw a dye pack in the bottom of the pool, and we didn't know what it was. They had the pool drained and cleaned, but she said it continued to happen about a dozen times over the course of the summer. Guests were disappointed each time, and it cost the hotel thousands of dollars. Meanwhile, an obscure police got a similar call from a homeowner in August. We had a resident who was enjoying time in his pool and saw a drone flying over top. And the drone actually dropped something in his pool that made his pool turn green immediately. The green stuff was. He died. Normally used by search and rescue teams, and it can be damaging to pools. On Friday, police say the drone was spotted over the Quality Inn again. And this time with help from the FAA, the drone was tracked back to this business across the White Horse Pike.

Michael seemed like a quiet boy, but every day he would walk into to a small grocery store in Texas with his backpack. This recurring behavior soon aroused the suspicion of the clerk, Sarah. Her concerns prompted her to start observing him more closely and discreetly whenever he entered the store. Sarah noticed Michael buying multiple packs of baby wipes daily, far more than any child his age could possibly need. No boy his age would require that many wipes, especially every single day. She instantly sensed something was terribly wrong, breaking out in a cold sweat, convinced something was amiss with this boy, she made a bold decision. One evening after Michael left the grocery store, Sarah quietly followed him. After walking for about 10 minutes, Michael suddenly stopped in a deserted area. What Sarah saw next shocked her deeply. She immediately pulled out her phone to call the police, only demanding that Michael be locked up for life. What Michael did with those wipes will leave you speechless.

A customer was dissatisfied with the temperature of the spicy soup and poured boiling soup onto the cashier, causing serious injuries to the cashier. At present, the victim has filed a lawsuit seeking compensation of $3 million. Thirty one year old Amanda Nicole Martinez previously ordered a take out menu soup to bring home. Subsequently, she angrily returned to the store claiming that the temperature of the soup was too high and that the plastic from the takeaway box had melted and fallen into the soup. Twenty four year old cashier Janelle Broland processed a refund for her and offered to replace her soup, but Amanda refused to listen and constantly insulted Janelle in front of her children and other customers. Janelle remained calm and demanded that Amanda stop insulting and leave, otherwise she would call the police. Suddenly, the customer poured almost boiling soup onto Janelle's face. After Janelle realized it, she immediately ran to wash it off. The hot soup had caused severe burns to her face and blood was flowing from her nose and eyes. Afterwards, the police went to Amanda's residence and arrested her. During the trial, Amanda refused to plead guilty and was released later that day after paying a fine of $800.

Today was Eli's birthday. She and her three best friends came home to celebrate. Her parents happily prepared the cake and then left the room to give the young people some space. When the fun was at its peak, the moment she smiled and blew out the candles, an accident happened. One of her friends suddenly pushed her face into the cake. A second later, Eli fell to the ground and didn't move anymore. Her friends thought it was a joke and excitedly called her to get up. But to everyone's shock, blood began to seep from the cake. It turned out that there were several thin skewers hidden in the cake, and one of them had directly pierced Eli's face. Hearing the screams, her parents rushed into the room. The scene before them terrified them. Fortunately, the medical staff arrived in time and successfully saved Eli's life. However, a scar that would never fade remained on her face. After the incident, Eli's parents took these friends to court, but since they were all only 15 years old, they ultimately received no punishment.

A 15 year old killer smiled in court and said I just want to tell y'all I'll be home soon or I'll be Kian. I love my family. But the judge's ruling would soon wipe that smile right off his face. Thirty two year old Kenneth White was driving his van on the interstate when suddenly a seven pound rock flew down from an overpass striking white in the head and chest. Father of four died instantly. Perpetrators were four teenagers aged between 15 and seventeen. In court they yelled and danced around thinking they'd soon be released because of their young age. When their defense lawyer tried to convince the judge to prosecute them as juveniles, the judge firmly denied the request saying the proposal for juvenile sentencing is rejected. Plaus erupted from the victim's family. Now these teenagers will be tried as adults facing potential life sentences. Do you support the judge's decision? Share your thoughts in the comments below.

In March, Christopher Gregor, a father, brought his six year old son Corey Mckeylo to the gym for exercise. According to the surveillance footage, Corey was running wildly on the treadmill and was thrown off six times in a row, each time facing down. However, his father was watching from the side. Not only did he not stop his son, but he also forced him to keep running on it. Corey's mother said that after Corey got home, he kept reporting that he was not feeling well, but Gregor didn't care. A few days later, Corey had difficulty breathing and an epileptic seizure. The doctor took rescue measures but ultimately failed to save Corey's life. Court documents stated that Corey's deceased was due to a blunt impact on the chest and abdomen followed by a torn liver. It was determined that it was caused by a fall while running. In court, Gregor stated that he had not harmed his son. After the judge watched the surveillance footage, he angrily sentenced him to 25 years in prison.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, that ain't gonna happen. That ain't gonna happen. No, Mimi. Listen, I told you the two children fought over a sentence right before playoffs. The coach takes them to the firehouse, hoping team building can fix what's broken. The kids pull dummies, spray hoses, working together again like a real team. As soon as they turned around, the two children started fighting. The coach and parents rushed to break up the fight. The purpose of this team building was to make the players more united, but the result was just the opposite. Stow rocks takes on Ambridge, and from the first snap, they get steamrolled. Teammates didn't give Jamar a pick and roll and he broke down. He rips off his helmet, shoulder pads, walks off. Jay quits, too. I'm out. They don't wanna play anyway. They lose 27 to 0. Worse, kids start blaming each other, pushing, fighting. The coach says, I feel that I try to do a good job. I've coached the same this year as I've coached in the past. You know, I've sat down and talked to myself, what did I do wrong this year as a coach? And I just can't come up with it. He says this is his final season coaching. I've loved these kids since June, but I worry some of them, they're either gonna end up in jail or worse. So here's the question, are kids today Just too soft, or did we, the adults, fail to teach them what a team even means? Drop your thoughts in the comments.

Without thinking twice, he pulled out his own wallet and covered the difference. He says it wasn't the first time. If someone was struggling, he was happy to help. But the bridge authority didn't care. They fired him for breaking the rules. The crazy part, they never gave him an official warning, just a few verbal reminders. Then suddenly they gave him an ultimatum, work only two days a week or leave. Sam was furious. If you don't trust me to work five days, why would you trust me to work 2? He refused the offer and got fired. Now tons of people are calling out the Bridge Authority online saying they're heartless for.

Obscuring license plates on purpose is nothing new, but two things are increasingly making that practice a real issue for law enforcement. No. 1, as you mentioned, the proliferation of red light cameras as we have here in the Boulevard. And No. 2, high tech methods being used to keep police from seeing those tags. This may seem like something out of a British spy novel, but it's a real device found on a vehicle that was recently impounded by Philadelphia police. And while remote controlled license plate flippers are not common, people driving around with obscured or fraudulent and tags is. If you drive around, notice there's paper tags everywhere and many of them aren't legitimate. They can be copied on a copier or printed out off the computer. Captain John Ryan, commanding officer of the Major Crimes Unit says there's no way of knowing for sure if the implementation of red light cameras resulted in more people obscuring their tags, but those cameras sure are capturing images of a lot of them.

The report says Malone was riding his bike home from work on campus because his roommate at Shoreline Community College had just died, and Malone was upset. Behind him in a car, Gordon and Rogers were honking and yelling at Malone to get off the road. Malone flipped them off. The football players tried to run him off the road with their car. Malone spit towards the car, and then the chase was on. Cameras in this stairwell caught the entire thing. They assaulted me. I was pushed, I was hit in the face. My bike was broken. My glasses were broken. This incident happened in March. A big question is, why was Tybo Rogers still on campus? Because at this point, two separate women had already reported to police that Rogers raped them. One victim reported her attack.

I talked at 8:30. I came back at 12:30. The truck marks are still on it. So I wrote it for a two hour violation. But Brennan is violating the Constitution Michigan who argued that marking tires is similar to police secretly putting a GPS on a vehicle without a proper warrant. That's a violation of the 4th Amendment right against unreasonable searches. I don't mind at all. I think it's a chalk wipes off very, very easily. So it's not a problem. The court, which covers four Midwest states, ruled that now a warrant is needed because the purpose of marking tires is to raise revenue and not for public safety. Ken Kissell, who owns Live Wire Security in Irvington, says the chalking keeps three spots open for customers. So somebody can run in, run out and not have to worry about getting a ticket for just being parked for 5 minutes like you do with a lot of other towns that have parking meters. In the meantime, the village is considering more high tech options.

When he reached out to Tesla support for help, he didn't receive a solution. Instead, they sent him a link to the user manual. Tesla's exact words, please refer to page 198. You must activate car wash mode before washing. Yes, really.

It may look real, but this is synthetic grass and it's LED to a turf war with City Hall. Homeowner Frank Leone installed the fake grass on his North York lawn because he's in his 80s. He's had a stroke and has limited mobility. Shortly after the turf went in, a complaint was filed by a neighbor. Frank got a notice from the city. Receiving help from former Council Karen stints, Leone called a bylaw officer to inspect the lawn, getting approval last October and he got it in writing. Leone thought it was over, but just a month later, a building inspector from the city said the lawn is not permeable, meaning water can't pass through it. And he's being charged for failure to comply with an order. This despite the approval of a bylaw officer. He's now being served with additional notices of violation, including fines if he doesn't replace his grass within the next 30 days. According to Leone, he was told that the primary issue was a lack of water flow, even though his turf has many holes and it allows water to flow through easily.

To claim her territory. I snapped off a piece and stuffed it into my own. She gave me a quick dismissive look. Then her lips curved into a sly smile like she found it funny that I was eating something that wasn't even mine. I glanced at her again as she slowly broke off another piece and ate it. I refused to back down, pulling the chocolate toward me. Just then, the next stop announcement interrupted. She stood up to leave. It's all yours, she said. I watched her go, smiling unconsciously as the train started moving. I was still lost in that funny little encounter until I realized my own chocolate had been in my pocket all along. Fate really works in strange ways. Weeks later, we met again on the train. I awkwardly apologized for what happened before and handed her the portrait I'd drawn of her. We shook hands and started talking. The conversation flowed easily. When she said her stop was coming up, I reluctantly said goodbye. But as she turned away, she suddenly called out and handed the portrait back to me. Oh, no, she said. This is yours. Keep it. Give it to me again. I took it and saw a phone number written on the back. Looking up at her fading figure, pure joy rushed through me. Two people drawn to each other, falling in love came naturally. We soon got married. Had a smart, adorable son. Our love wasn't new anymore, but it had grown deeper, stronger. One evening, I came home from work, kissed my sleeping wife gently, then went to wash up. Out of nowhere, dizziness hit me hard. I collapsed on the floor. After a long while, I gasped for air and came to my wife was still asleep. I forced myself up, quietly, shutting the bathroom door. Months ago, doctors told me I had a malignant brain tumor. There was nothing they could do. I tried to tell her so many times, but I couldn't. I knew her too well. A year ago, her brother died in an accident. It nearly destroyed her. For months, she locked herself away, refusing to talk or accept comfort. Only recently, she had started to heal. Watching her teach our son, I smiled. Such a warm, beautiful moment. But the longer I watched, the more it hurt. I hid in the bathroom, wiping away my tears. The plan I prepared for so long echoed in my head, and I finally decided to go through with it.

The woman screamed in pain. For ordinary people, this might seem trivial, but for someone with mysophobia, it was as disgusting as dipping one's hand in cow dung. Anna suffered from severe mysophobia. She only wore white clothes every day, and not a single stain was allowed. She had to disinfect the surface before sitting down. Even when opening a window, she had to wear gloves first. If anyone accidentally touched her hands, she would rush to the bathroom to wash them. She'd squeeze out two pumps of hand sanitizer and wash her hands for a full 20 minutes. Every time she turned off the faucet, she felt her hands were dirty again, so she would wash them once more. She washed her hands up to 100 times a day. Anna carried a hair dryer with her every time she went out. If someone touched her hair, she'd rush to the bathroom immediately, take out her pre prepared shampoo, and thoroughly wash her hair. What was even more absurd was that she was a researcher who worked with microorganisms. Every day, she thought the air was full of bacteria, so she disinfected her office daily, which LED to complaints from the cleaning staff. Her extreme mysophobia disrupted Anna's life, so she went to a hospital for treatment. But she met all kinds of patients with obsessive compulsive disorder. There was an uncle Who frantically calculated numbers. No matter how difficult the problem, he could figure out the answer in just one second. There was an aunt who compulsively checked her belongings. Once she couldn't find something, she would become extremely restless, always in a state of high emotional tension. There was also a man who would never step on the lines on the ground. Besides that, he had symmetry OCD. Everything had to be placed symmetrically. The doctor hadn't arrived yet, so everyone shared their story.

You heard right. Nicole Jones and her children are forced to live in a garage right in the middle of one of America's wealthiest zip codes, Silicon Valley. This is the garage. Nicole, who's a bartender, pays $1,000 a month for the converted garage in San Mateo, California. I know it's a garage, but this was nicer than everything that I had looked at that was almost twice this price. Nicole says she can no longer afford to live in the area where the average rent tops three grand a month. Employees from companies like apple and Google searching for housing have pushed rents into the stratosphere. Nicole's cramped garage home is only 250 square feet, but big enough to hold her bed. In the Bay Area. It breaks your heart because these people don't know. She says all the publicity has spooked her landlord. She's afraid he'll evict her, leaving her and her children homeless. I can go to bed at night knowing that I tried.

This past summer, Donna installed a tall privacy fence on her lot along Trotter's Walk in Newton County. Turned out to be too tall. Complaints came in. The county told her to cut it down to size. She did. But over the Thanksgiving weekend, she painted it. Dick Hopkins, Liz, two doors down. The neon colors are making him see red, but it's only on one side of the fence. On Donna's side, it's a bluish gray to match the trim on her home. I don't know what her problem is, but she certainly doesn't have any respect for her, the neighbors. Donna says over the last couple of years she hasn't seen eye to eye with a neighbor on the other side of the fence. She believed a little more privacy was best for everybody. But she says the county incorrectly told her a 6 foot fence was fine. As for the paint job, the county does not regulate the color of a residence fence. That paint is a 20 year warranty paint. So within 15 years, if it needs to be repainted, it'll be painted the same color.

My husband, Jack, had taken off his pants, made a noose with his belt and climbed a coconut tree. I crept beneath the tree and found him on the phone with another woman talking like a total scumbag. I was furious, wanted to strangle him. But Jack sensed something was wrong and quickly lied he was picking coconuts. Didn't confront him. Then that night with him lying on top of me, I secretly checked his phone. The phone that never had a password suddenly needed one. I knew right away he was cheating. The next morning, Jack woke up, panicked in the seawater, crawled ashore. I told him our yacht and phones, I've been washed away. We'd have to wait for rescue. Seeing him spiral, I excused myself to look for food on the far side of the island. Actually, I'd hidden the yacht and phones to make him panic. Jack followed and saw the keys around my neck but pretended not to notice. While I slept, Jack stole the keys, started the yacht and tied me to a tree with rope, planning to let me starve. I broke free and chased him, but he'd already started the yacht and taunted me as he left. I didn't chase the boat, grab tools and went into the jungle. I planned this and sabotaged the boat. Sure enough, as the yacht pulled away, the rope beneath it tightened. And Jack fell into the water, choking on seawater. I made a bow and arrows in the jungle, planning to kill him when he came ashore. Jack came ashore shouting my name, begging for forgiveness, wandered into a cave and found headless corpses hanging and natives doing rituals. Terrified, he fled the cave to warn me. I suddenly shot an arrow that nearly pierced his skull. He hid behind a tree, and I kept hunting him with my bow. Jack grabbed coconuts to block my shots and ran the other way. I leapt forward and fired another arrow.

Leslie Nurse says she was at the self checkout at the Sims Walmart with her husband and three kids fighting a malfunctioning scanner, even getting help from a Walmart associate. After she thought she'd finished and paid, she was stopped by an asset Protection manager. She was eventually charged with stealing $48 worth of groceries. She was eventually arrested, mugshot taken, but the criminal charge was eventually dropped when no one from Walmart showed up to court. By then, she said the damage to her reputation had already been done, her ability to make a living stifled by the criminal charge. What was worse, she continued to receive leave demand letters from a Walmart affiliated law firm offering to drop the matter if she paid them $200. But it turns out many people do. During testimony in the lawsuit she filed against the company, an expert testified Walmart routinely uses. To add insult to injury, Walmart never produced a video that would have been recorded at the self checkout area that would have proved nurse shoplifted or didn't. At the end of this lawsuit, a unanimous jury found for nurse and awarded her $2.1 million in punitive damages.

Her this underground life doesn't just cut expenses, it offers more safety and privacy than anything above ground. The bunker was originally built as an emergency shelter for natural disasters. Designed by the homeowner himself, it's equipped with proper ventilation and moisture Protection. She even claims it's safer than any downtown apartment. Her friend once built it to store supplies and ride out crises. Now it's become the cheapest rental in town.

My wife Julia walked into our bedroom while I was booking dinner reservations for her birthday next month. She announced, I need you to understand my career comes before this marriage. I stopped typing and looked at her. We've been married for three years, and I'd work double shifts to pay bills while she was in business school. For our marriage? I asked. She rolled her eyes. My mentor, Bradley, says mixing personal life with business is weakness. Real success requires sacrifice, she told me. Bradley had been texting her during dinner lately. From now on, work is the priority. Not birthdays, not holidays, not your needs, he continued. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I already told Bradley you're holding me back, he says. That's typical. She added, wait. She told her mentor I was holding her back after everything I've done? So everything comes second to work? I asked. She nodded firmly. Everything. Bradley made millions by 35 because he never let emotions interfere. I thought about arguing, but decided on something else. That's what you want, I told her. Julia smiled and immediately started texting someone. She thought I'd cave? Nope. Her birthday came three weeks later. Usually I'd plan something special. This year, nothing. She came home to a regular Tuesday. Did you forget? She asked, looking confused. Birthdays are personal. Career comes first, remember? I replied. Her face dropped. But you always do something She said quietly. I shrugged. You said celebrations were distractions. He ordered takeout and ate alone while I watched TV. I heard her on the phone with someone later. No, he didn't do anything. Yeah, I'm alone. She was saying, good. Let her explain that to her friends. Her company's investor gala was next month. We leave at seven, she announced. I stayed on the couch. I'm not going, I told her. She froze. Everyone brings spouses. People will ask questions, he said. You said mixing personal with professional was weakness. I reminded her. She begged. Please, just this once, I asked. Bradley says emotions interfere with success, right? She left alone. My buddy Tom.

Connie was devastated. Bobby moved on and married Sandra D. This marriage was a little bit chaotic. Connie's record label was basically threatening to drop her. But her father, who was just a smitch, controlling, was determined to make her a star. He was like, listen, you need to remake the song who's sorry now? She was over it. She was like, uh, uh. But she did it. Dick Clark played it on American Bandstand and it was a hit. She became an overnight sensation. Even though she found success with her career, her personal life was a little bit messier. Connie was married four times, and none of these marriages stuck. When she was 27, she married a press agent named Dick Connellis. This marriage lasted about four months. Seven years later, she married Izzy Marion. He was a hairdresser. This marriage lasted 10 months. A couple of years later, she married husband No. 3, Joe Garzelli. Together they adopted a son named Joe junior. This was her longest marriage. It lasted five years. But during this marriage, in 1974, when she was 37 years old, she was appearing at a music festival. She returned to her motel. She was brutally assaulted. She was raped. There was a mattress thrown onto her. She almost suffocated.

Even now, 63 years after this single came out, pretty little baby Connie Francis is going viral. Connie was the first true pop star of the rock and roll era. She had 35 Top 40 hits in a decade. She sang in 15 languages. But behind her fame, Connie Francis went through a lot. She was born on December 12, 1937 in Newark, New Jersey. She's a Sagittarius. She was born Concetta Rosa Maria Franconero. Her family, Italian American. Her father George, mother Ida and little brother George junior were all very close. When she was 12 years old, she started singing professionally. She played the accordion guardian and her father would enter her in pageants and talent shows. The next year, she started going by Connie Francis because it was easier to pronounce. When she was just 16, she signed a record deal with MGM Records. Even though she was signed to a label early on, her songs weren't really hitting it. She was hired to be Tuesday Weld's singing voice in the movie Rock, Rock, Rock. Remember I just talked about her? She started working with up and coming singer Bobby Darren. They were both young, starting to get famous and they fell for each other hard. But when her pops found out, he was furious. And as the story goes, he started chasing Bobby around the house with a pew, pew.

Al ver a la secretaria pavonearse a su lado, el jefe tambi√©n lo consider√≥ inapropiado. La rega√±√≥ en el acto y le dijo que se vistiera con decencia. Luego, para calmar los √°nimos en la oficina, le pidi√≥ que fuera a comprar caf√© para los empleados, pero apenas sali√≥ le pas√≥ la tarea a la chica. Ella como practicante tuvo que aguantar y obedecer y otra vez le escribi√≥ a su mam√° para quejarse. √âl, jefe, al leer eso, sali√≥ de inmediato a reprender a la secretaria, dici√©ndole que √©l se lo pidi√≥ A ella, practicante y que si no le gustaba pod√≠a irse de la empresa. La secretaria se fue furiosa a comprar caf√©. Justo en ese momento la mejor amiga de la chica lo vio todo y se encendi√≥. Su alma chismosa. Sospech√≥ que hab√≠a algo entre su amiga y su hermano, el jefe, as√≠ que fue a preguntarle directamente. Pero √©l no tuvo piedad, le quit√≥ su mesada y la ech√≥ de la oficina. Ella no sab√≠a que su hermano ya le hab√≠a echado el ojo a la chica. Mientras tanto, la chica segu√≠a escribi√©ndole a su mam√°. En tono de amenaza cari√±osa. Le dijo que si no respond√≠a tendr√≠a que mandarle un sobre rojo de doscientos pesos. El jefe lo ley√≥ y le transfiri√≥ veinte cero cero cero. Sin decir palabra, la chica se qued√≥ congelada. Justo entonces la secretaria regres√≥ con un mont√≥n de caf√©. La chica aprovech√≥ para tomarle una foto en ese estado y se la mand√≥ a su mam√° diciendo que la secretaria solo quer√≠a meterse la cama del jefe y que viv√≠a amarg√°ndole la vida a los dem√°s. Tambi√©n le cont√≥ ella dec√≠a que iba a encargarse del evento del aniversario, pero en realidad nunca hac√≠a nada y siempre se llevaba el cr√©dito del trabajo ajeno. El jefe al leer todo eso se puso furioso y anunci√≥ que evento del aniversario lo manejar√≠a completamente la chica. La secretaria qued√≥ en shock, mientras que la mejor amiga Chica lo disfrutaba al m√°ximo y estaba segura de que el jefe estaba enamorado. Pero la chica se asust√≥ y le tap√≥ la boca, diciendo que todo era una coincidencia y que adem√°s ten√≠a un compromiso de matrimonio. La amiga corri√≥ a contarle esto al jefe justo cuando √©l recib√≠a una llamada de la abuela. Ella le dijo que ir√≠a al aniversario. ¬øQu√© llevar√≠a a su futura nuera? Le pidi√≥ que se comportara como debe. El jefe mir√≥ hacia la chica que segu√≠a trabajando sin parar, pensaba decir que no, sin saber que la chica era justo su prometida. La abuela quiso mandarle una foto de ella, pero por la mala se√±al no logr√≥ enviarla. Lleg√≥ el d√≠a del aniversario. La chica estaba ajustando los equipos sin saber que ten√≠a en la mano el celular del jefe. Tampoco sab√≠a que la secretaria ya hab√≠a sobornado al t√©cnico y planeaba hacerla quedar en rid√≠culo cuando ella no miraba. La secretaria subi√≥ unos archivos vergonzosos al tel√©fono. Poco despu√©s, la abuela lleg√≥ al evento y reconoci√≥ de inmediato a la chica. En ese momento, el t√©cnico encendi√≥ el proyector y la chica mand√≥ otro mensaje cari√±oso. Por costumbre. Cuando el jefe abri√≥ el mensaje, todo lo que hab√≠an hablado se proyect√≥ en la pantalla gigante. La sala estall√≥. La secretaria se qued√≥ paralizada sin entender qu√© pasaba y los apodos cari√±osos entre los dos desataron una ola de chismes entre los empleados.

I don't feel it anymore, she said. Eyes her spoon. I think we should end things. My chest went tight. Is there someone else? No, too fast. I just need to be honest with myself. With us. She stirred sugar into her coffee. She'd never liked it. Sweet, okay, I said. Her eyes flicked up, surprised, like she expected me to beg. Okay, if that's how you feel. She moved out that week, took her clothes, her books, half the furniture. I helped her pack. Calm, polite, like we were co workers ending a project. She kept saying she was sorry, that she hoped we could stay friends. I just nodded. The nights after she left were long and silent. I, I couldn't sleep. Just lay there replaying everything frame by frame. Then I remembered her laptop. We shared passwords, devices, accounts. She'd never changed them. I opened her messages and there it was. Months of texts with someone named Marcus, her coworker, just a friend from the office. The messages started friendly, then flirty, then explicit. I can't stop thinking about You last night was incredible. When can we do it again? I scrolled up, trace the timeline. It started four months ago, right when she got busy with work. The night she cancelled our venue visit. She'd been with him. I kept reading, then saw the most recent messages. The merger goes live next month. After that, we can finally be public. Can't wait. No more hiding. The merger, the one she'd been talking about non stop. Marcus VP at the competing company. I sat back, hands shaking, then breathing, then still. I closed the laptop and started planning. For three weeks, I said nothing. Didn't reply to her checking in texts, didn't ask about Marcus, but I was collecting screenshots of every message, every photo, every time stamp. Found out Marcus was married, two kids, his wife's Instagram full of family vacations. I checked his company's ethics policy, relationships between executives forbidden. He signed a morality clause. Scandal equals termination. Perfect. I compiled it all, a neat folder of destruction. Then I waited. The merger announcement was October 15th. Huge press event. Both CEOs, executives from both sides, my ex, Marcus cameras, live streams. A week before she texted me, hey, I know this is weird, but I wanted you to know I'm seeing someone. I hope that's okay. I typed back, that's great. I'm happy for you. She sent a heart emoji. October 15th, I woke early, made coffee, opened my laptop, pulled up emails for three business reporters covering The merger typed one short message, thought you should know about an ethics violation involving two executives at today's merger announcement. Screenshots attached, attached everything. The next, the photos, the timeline. Marcus's claws, his wife's Instagram hit send. 8:00am press conference 10, I turned on the live stream. At 9:55, the ballroom gleamed. Glass podium, corporate banners, flashing cameras. My ex stood to the right in a navy suit, Marcus beside her, confident, perfect. The CEO started his speech. Growth projections, shared vision, synergy. At 10:23, a journalist raised his hand. Excuse me, I have a question about an internal ethics matter. The room quieted. Can you comment on the romantic relationship between two executives here today? He said their names. My ex froze. Marcus's smile vanished. The CEO blinked. What are you referring to? The reporter lifted his phone. We've received explicit messages between them dating back months. It violates both company's ethics codes. Another journalist stood. And Marcus's morality clause signed last year that would void his position. Correct. The CEO's expression turned to stone. He turned to them. Is this true? Marcus stammered. We, it's not. My ex just stood there, eyes wide. The chat feed blew up. Thousands watching live. The CEO whispered to his assistant. Security stepped forward. Sir, ma'am, please come with us, one reporter called out. We've also confirmed Marcus is married, two children. Gasps from the room. Marcus went red. My ex looked like she might faint. The CEO face the cameras. This press conference is over. We will investigate these allegations immediately. The feed cut out. By noon, it was everywhere. Merger implodes amid executive affair scandal. VP fired for violating morality clause. Marcus terminated. My ex spended under review. The merger postponed indefinitely. My phone buzzed non stop. Unknown numbers, reporters asking for comments. I turned it off. That evening she called from another number. I let it ring. Her voicemail, drew, please, I know it was you. You ruined my life, my career, everything. I deleted it. Full story on the channel linked below.

I said, perfect, and stayed calm. The next day, I sold the land it was built on and disappeared. By morning there were 42 missed calls and my mother was crying. Fine. My father said it at Sunday dinner. We've decided to give the house to your sister. The dining room smelled like roast chicken and lemon cleaner. The house I'd helped renovate, the one I'd pay taxes on for three years when they couldn't. Rachel sat across from me, smiling like she'd won something. The whole house? I asked. Yes, my mother said. Rachel needs it more. She has the kids, you're single. You have your apartment. Been paying their mortgage $1,200 a month for four years. Rachel hadn't paid a cent. You understand, don't you? My father said, family helps family. I looked at them, then at Rachel, her smug little smile. Perfect. I said softly. That makes sense. My mother blinked. Really? Yeah. Rachel needs it more. They looked relieved. Rachel squeezed my hand. Thank you for understanding. Of course, I said. I finished dinner, helped with dishes, drove home in silence. I didn't know about the land. Ten years ago, my grandmother left it to me in her will. Not the house, just the land beneath it. A legal quirk from an old subdivision. My parents inherited the house. I inherited the dirt under it. They never read the paperwork, never asked questions. They just assumed It was all theirs. I'd let them live there, pay the taxes, fix the roof, because that's what family does. Family helps family. After that dinner, I went home and pulled out the deed at my kitchen table, read it three times. The land was mine. Legally, entirely. They could have the house, but without the land, it was worthless. I called a real estate attorney the next morning. Can I sell land that has a house on it? Of course, he said. You own the land. The structure is the buyer's problem. They'll either buy it or vacate. And if they don't, eviction's an option. I smiled. How fast can we close? If you have a buyer, a week. I did. A developer had reached out five years ago wanting to build town homes in that area. Offered me $340,000. I said no then, because my parents live there. But things change. I called him, still interested in the property. He didn't hesitate. Absolutely. I can have paperwork ready tomorrow. Do it. I. For the next week, I acted normal. Texted my mom about her doctor's visit, sent Rachel a baby gift. They thought everything was fine. Friday morning, the sale closed. $340,000 hit my account by noon. By three PM, certified letters went out. The land beneath your property has been sold. You have 30 days to purchase the parcel or vacate. I packed a bag, drove three hours north to a cabin with no cell service. When I turned my phone back on Monday morning. I had 42 missed calls. 37 from my mother, five from my father, 16 voicemails. The first was my mother sobbing, what did you do? You can't just sell the land. That's our house! The second, my father. You're destroying your family over money. We gave you everything! The third. Rachel, you selfish bastard! Mom's having a breakdown. The kids are terrified. Grow up! I deleted them all. Then came the texts. My mother, please, we'll give you the house. Just this. My father. The developer wants DOLLAR500K. We can't pay that. Please call me Rachel. You're making your nieces homeless. Hope you're proud. I turned the phone face down. Watch the lake outside my window ripple. A week later, my lawyer called. Your parents want to negotiate, he said. For what? They're asking if you'll buy the land back and lease it to them. No. They're threatening to sue. On what grounds? None that hold up. Then let them try. By the end of the month, they did. Claimed adverse possession. Said they'd lived there long enough to own the land. But I'd paid the taxes every year. The judge ruled for the developer. 60 days to vacate. My mother called one last time. I answered. Hello? Silence. Then quiet. Crying. How could you? We raised you. Where are your parents? You were giving the house to Rachel. I said evenly. I just gave the land to someone else. That's different. Is it? You decided I didn't deserve the house because Rachel needed it more. I decided you didn't deserve the land because someone else wanted it more. She tried again. We never would have known I had leverage. That I wasn't just your safety net. She sobbed. You said family helps family. I continue. I helped you for years. Paid your mortgage, taxes, everything. The moment you didn't need me, you cut me out. Please. You have 60 days. I said quietly, start packing. I hung up. Blocked every number. Full story on the channel

So there's this guy in my grade who's basically allergic to not being the center of attention, like physically cannot handle not being the main character of every situation. He's the type who'd light his shoes on fire if he thought it would get him 5 seconds of fame. Last year, he literally jumped out of a second story window during lunch to impress some girl he barely knew, broke his ankle in three places, got suspended for a month. We all figured that would be his wake up call, you know, like maybe almost breaking his entire leg would teach him that attention isn't worth permanent damage. It didn't. First day back from suspension and he walked into school like he'd won a medal. Everyone was talking about the window thing and you could tell he was loving every second. He had this huge boot on his foot and was milking it for everything it was worth. By third period, I already had a bad feeling about what was coming next. Fast forward to sixth period art class. It's right after lunch. Everyone's half asleep and our teacher is this older lady who's way too trusting for her own good. She leaves the room constantly. This particular day she stepped out to grab more supplies from the storage closet down the hall. The second, and I mean the exact second, that door Clicked shut. This kid's eyes light up. He looks around the room with this expression like he just discovered fire. Then he reaches across the table and grabs two tubes of acrylic paint, bright blue, holds them up over his head like trophies and announces to the entire class, 20 bucks as I can drink both of these right now. The room explodes. Everyone's immediately yelling at him, dude, no, that's literal poison. You're gonna die. But he's already got this grin on his face. I realize with complete horror that he's not joking. This is actually happening. He unscrews the cap off the first tube while we're all still protesting. I legitimately thought he was bluffing like this was some elaborate bit and he chicken out at the last second. He didn't. He tilted his head back, opened his mouth and squeeze that entire tube of paint straight down his throat like it was a go gurt. Bright blue paint. I watched it disappear. The whole class went silent, just staring in disbelief. Then he wiped his mouth, grabbed the second tube and did it again. For a moment, nothing happened. He's standing there.

My daughter Riley, has severe dyslexia. Reading out loud is torture for her. She stumbles over words, takes forever to get through sentences, and kids usually snicker. Her regular teacher, Missus Henderson, understood this and had developed subtle ways to avoid putting Riley on the spot. But last Tuesday, Riley came home sobbing harder than I'd seen in months. Missus Henderson was out sick, and they had a substitute named Miss Williams. This woman had zero understanding of learning disabilities and decided to go around the room having each student read a full paragraph from their history textbook. Riley tried to explain that she had accommodations, but Miss Williams cut her off. Everyone needs to participate equally. No special treatment. So Riley had to stumble through an entire paragraph about the Revolutionary War while 28 kids sat in silence. She said some words backwards, skipped lines, and had to restart three times. The whole ordeal took nearly five minutes. That would have been humiliating enough, but here's where it gets worse. Some kid named Derek thought this was hilarious. While Riley was struggling, he secretly recorded the whole thing on his phone. By lunch, he posted it on social media with crying, laughing emojis and the caption, when you can't even read like a normal person. By the time school ended, half the seventh grade had seen it. Kids were doing impressions. Of Riley's reading voice in the hallways. I was absolutely furious when Riley showed me the video that night. My hands were shaking as I watched my daughter's worst nightmare playing out on a phone screen. I called the school first thing the next morning, ready to unleash hell. The front office transferred me directly to Miss Williams's classroom phone. I started explaining the situation, my voice getting louder with each sentence. I told her about Riley's diagnosis, her accommodations, the humiliation she'd endured. I was building up to demand she be fired when Miss Williams interrupted me. Ma'am, I am so incredibly sorry, she said quietly. I had no idea about Riley's accommodations. I should have asked her. Genuine remorse caught me off guard, but I was still furious about Derek's video. Well, what are you going to do about the kid? Who
