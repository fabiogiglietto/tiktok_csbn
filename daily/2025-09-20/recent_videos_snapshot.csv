Allison couldn't let anyone else have their moment. At our cousin Jamie's beach wedding, she grabbed the mic during toasts to announce her divorce. During our cousin Alex's first dance, she loudly told everyone at our table she was pregnant. At my best friend's reception, she stood on a chair during the cutting to reveal she was moving to Paris. That moment of chaos at her reception was nothing compared to what awaited me three months later at my wedding. Everything was going perfectly until the speeches started. My maid of honor was halfway through her beautiful toast when Allison stood up. She clinked her glass dramatically and walked to the front. She took the microphone right out of my friend's hand. Sorry, but I have something important to share while everyone's here, she announced. She pulled her boyfriend, Craig, up beside her. She told the entire room they were adopting a baby from Korea. My guests erupted in confused congratulations while my maid of honor stood there holding her speech cards uselessly. The rest of my reception became the Allison show. People kept coming up to her for details about the adoption. Someone started a collection for baby supplies using the envelope box meant for our cards. The photographer spent 20 minutes doing an impromptu photo shoot of her and Craig. My mom found me crying in the bathroom and told me I was being dramatic. She's just excited about becoming a mother, she said. You should be happy for family. My aunt agreed that Allison was just enthusiastic about sharing good news. A few months later, at Sunday dinner, Allison announced her wedding date. She went on and on about her vintage Hollywood glamour theme. She'd already booked the historic Grandview Manor downtown. Frank sat there nodding while she showed everyone her Pinterest boards. I want it to be absolutely perfect, she gushed. No interruptions or distractions. Just all eyes on us for once. The irony nearly choked me, but I smiled and said it sounded lovely. That night, I started planning. Allison's fatal flaw was her complete blindness to her own behavior. She genuinely believed she was just sharing joy. She couldn't understand why anyone would mind. She also had zero ability to handle competition for attention. I reached out to my college theater friends first. My roommate Macy ran an improv group that specialized in flash mobs and public performances. When I explained my idea, she literally cackled with delight. Within a week, I had 12 performers committed to the cause. The tricky part was getting them into the wedding. I studied Allison's guest list when she left it at my mom's house. Several couples had generic plus one RSVPs. Macy's performers could pose as dates for single guests. I knew. I reached out to these friends and explained the situation. Every single one wanted to help. After hearing About my wedding the wedding was as over the top as expected. Allison had seven bridesmaids and released doves during the ceremony. The reception ballroom dripped with crystals and white roses. My performers were scattered perfectly throughout the room as planned. Guests everything started during dinner service. At exactly 6:30, Macy stood up at table 4 and let out a shriek. Her fake boyfriend was on one knee between the salad and soup courses. The whole room turned to watch as she said yes. He slipped a costume jewelry ring on her finger. Allison's smile froze, but she started clapping along with everyone else. At 6:45 during the champagne toast.

For as long as I could remember, my younger brother Garrett had been insecure about being weak and scrawny. The LaCrosse team would shove him into lockers daily, calling him twig boy. The worst was when he couldn't open a water bottle at lunch and his crush Emily laughed, asking the guy next to her, Garrett's too weak. He needs a man to help him. I always felt bad for him. But the day he discovered one punch man, everything changed. He burst into my room holding his phone, showing me Saitama's transformation. Look, he was just like me. A weak, bullied nobody. Then he did the simple training and became the strongest hero alive. I was just happy he found something that gave him hope. The very next morning, Garrett started Saitama's routine religiously. 100 push UPS, 100 sit UPS, 100 squats, a 10 kilometer run every single day. Within two months, his arms showed actual definition and his chest filled out his shirts. The LaCrosse team stopped shoving him around completely, while mom bought him protein powder and dad installed a pull up bar. Look at my dedicated boy, she'd beam at dinner. When he shaved his head bald, the school counselor pulled me aside. Whatever is motivating him, it's working. His grades are up, confidence through the roof. Even I was impressed when he bench pressed his body. Wait. For the first time. The best part was Emily Starting to notice watching him do pull UPS after school and asking about his anime workout, he'd flex and quote, Sidima, I'm just a guy who's a hero for fun. We all laughed because he was finally becoming the person he wanted to be. But as months passed, things shifted when Garrett demanded everyone call him Sidima. Refusing to respond to Garrett anymore, teachers got email signed Sidima, while he begged mom to legally change his name. When you're 18, she said, this is just a phase. Soon after, he quit soccer. Because Sidima trained alone, and his knuckles stayed permanently stabbed. From concrete walls in our basement. I'm removing my limiters, he explained, wrapping them in bloody gauze. Now deadlifting 300 pounds, his frame had exploded from 130 to 200 pounds of pure muscle, with veins sneaking up his arms like cables. When I tried talking to him about my concerns, he brushed me off. You're getting too intense about this whole point is to push past human limits. He showed me his training journal, filled with detailed power rankings, strength measurements, and notes about breaking through, with page after page of sidemen quotes highlighted in yellow. After he passed out doing squats, mom attempted an intervention. Honey, you need rest days. Tama never rested. That's why he transcended. He stormed out to run his 10 kilometer run at midnight. Then the mall incident started a week later, when he began picking fights, asking random guys to test his Power level until security banned him after the third confrontation. His fist now bore a tattoo reading one punch in bold letters across the knuckles. Six months into his transformation, Garrett looked like a bodybuilder who'd swallowed another bodybuilder. At 220 pounds of carved muscle with shoulders so wide he turned sideways through doorways. We were driving to get groceries on a normal Tuesday morning when he saw a cop conducting a routine traffic stop on the shoulder. Pull over, he said with deadly calm in his voice. What? No, we need to pull over. He grabbed the wheel. This is it, my moment. I pulled over with shaking hands as he got out and walked toward the officer with purpose. The cop immediately tensed with his hand moving to his whole

What did you learn? When Nathan took me to his family's mansion for the first time, I belong. The driveway was longer than my entire street, and their garage held more cars than my apartment building's parking lot. I was a waitress putting myself through nursing school, and he was the heir to a real estate empire. I tried hiding my background at first. I'd make excuses not to go to fancy restaurants, saying I wasn't hungry or had already eaten. When he bought me designer bags, I'd return them secretly and use the money for textbooks. I even practiced using the right forks at dinner by watching YouTube videos late at night. But Nathan wasn't like his family. He drove a beat up Volkswagen and wore the same three hoodies on rotation. When he found out I was returning his gifts, he started buying me practical things instead. Grocery store gift cards, gas money, nursing scrubs. He never made me feel small. His mother, Andrea, was different. She'd ask questions like, what country club did your family belong to? Or which prep school did you attend? When I admitted I went to public school, she'd purse her lips and change the subject. Once she accidentally spilled red wine on my only nice dress at a family dinner. Things got worse when Nathan proposed. Andrea cornered me in the kitchen during our engagement party. How much? She asked, pulling out her checkbook. Name your Price to walk away. You clearly only want his money. I was hurt, but stood my ground. I love your son. I'm not going anywhere. Two weeks later, she showed up at the diner where I worked, ordering coffee and staying for my entire shift. She left religious pamphlets about marrying within your class with her 10 cent tip. My hands shook so bad I dropped three plates that day. Then came the custody battle. Nathan's cousin Amy had lost her kids to social services after a drug relapse. She was rich, well connected and desperate to adopt. But no agency would approve her with her history. That's when she found Tommy. Tommy was a sweet six year old boy from my old neighborhood. Mom was my regular at the diner, a single mother working three jobs. When she got sick with cancer, she asked me to help find Tommy a good home. I promised I would. Nathan and I applied to adopt Tommy. We had a stable home, good jobs. I'd finish nursing school by then, and so much love to give. The social worker loved us. Tommy would come for weekend visits and we'd build blanket forts and make homemade pizzas together. But Andrea and Amy had other plans. Hired expensive lawyers, claiming we were financially unstable. They dug up my father's old Duis, my mother's welfare records. They painted me as white trash trying to climb the social ladder through Nathan. The final blow came when they Offered Tommy's dying mother $50,000 to change her recommendation to Amy. She was drowning in medical bills. She took the deal. I was destroyed. But Nathan surprised everyone. He walked into the final court hearing and announced he was giving

In my family, we had something called Health Day. Every Saturday morning at 9:00am sharp, we'd finish breakfast and dad would already have the basement ready with his white coat on and all his medical equipment laid out on metal trays in the basement. Our mom would kiss our foreheads before sending us down one by one. Then came the examinations. Thorough inspections of every inch of our bodies while he muttered medical terms and scribbled in thick blue binders. He'd make us stand naked under the bright lights while he circled us slow, his gloved fingers pressing into our skin, checking what he called abnormalities. He called it preventative care. I dreaded it. Every single week. The rule was you couldn't flinch or complain or you'd start over from the beginning. The strangest part? We weren't allowed to mention health day at school. Not to teachers, not to friends. I only realised in middle school how weird that was. How other kids just went to pediatricians once a year, not secret basement clinics every week. But the worst part was the special examinations. If dad found something concerning during the regular check, you'd get called down. On week nights, he had this small locked room with bright lights and an exam table with stirrups. The metal was always cold and he'd spend what felt like hours with his instruments, documenting every detail while telling us to relax and breathe. He said it Was for comprehensive assessment. The kid. I was terrified. I'd count the ceiling tiles over and over. But dad said fear meant you were taking your health seriously. When I got older, I started questioning everything. Why did we need weekly exams when no one else did? Why did mom drink before every health day? I remember once, at 14, I asked if I could skip it for Rachel's sleepover. Dad gripped my wrist and stared at me with these desperate eyes. Health Day is the only thing keeping you safe, he said. That's when I knew something was deeply wrong. Rachel's family had annual checkups, vaccinations, schedules, growth charts on the fridge. No basement procedures, no locked rooms, no binders documenting their bodies. Just normal healthcare. I finally refused to go downstairs when I turned 16. Dad went ballistic, screaming that I was ungrateful and didn't understand the dangers. Mom just stood there shaking. He locked me in my room and said I couldn't leave until I submitted to a full examination the next morning. Mom slipped me $20 under the door and whispered to use the window. When I came back that night, dad acted like nothing had happened. He just asked if I was ready for my examination, like he hadn't imprisoned me the night before. That's when I started planning. Still, the whole thing ate at me. Why was dad so obsessed with our health when he wasn't even a doctor? Where did he get all That equipment. Three months later, I told my health teacher everything. Missus Patterson kept her face very still as I explained our Saturday routine. She said she needed to make a phone call. I knew what that meant. She came back with the principal. Then the police came. Then child services. They took us out of class one by one. Just like health day. Except this time, we didn't go home. I'll never forget Dad's face when they arrested him. Not angry, just broken. I was protecting them, he kept saying. The officers found the binders. Dozens

Reshingling the roof in July, digging out a tree stump by hand, moving every piece of furniture in the house to steam clean the carpets. This kid never complained.

But it wasn't the way most teenage boys looked at girls. He had this soft smile, like he was watching something precious. I decided to test him. You know she's way out of your league, right? He wiped his forehead and said, oh, I know, sir. Trust me, I know. That's why I'm here every weekend, letting you test me. Cause she's worth it. I was about to respond when we heard screaming from inside the house. We both ran in to find my wife on the kitchen floor. She'd

No need to leave the door unlocked. Got it. Babe, can I ask you something? You're so chill about this. Aren't you worried I might do something I shouldn't? If that's what you wanna do.

Why nothing for my birthday this year? You never liked the gifts I got before, right? Figured cash would be better. Money is what matters anyway.

I used to work as a prison guard and one day our warden decided it would be a good idea to bring his 10 year old daughter in so she could see where dad works. He left her alone in his office for just a minute. When she wandered out, he found her 10 minutes later in one of the corridors bleeding out from her head with the fly on her pants undone. Watching him clutch her against his chest and hold her lifeless body repeating daddy's got you, sweetheart for hours was a sight I'll never forget. From that moment on, he became obsessed with finding out who did this. He didn't even take a day off from work, just came in next morning off, no sleep, spent the whole day grilling every prisoner in guard. He offered bribes, reduce sentences, special privileges, anything for information. I remember watching him break down between interviews then slam his head into the wall repeatedly just so the physical pain could momentarily drown out the emotional one for long enough to conduct the next interview. He grounded everybody he thought gave suspicious answers and threatened them with solitary confinement, beatings, firings for guards. He even went as far as forcing a prisoner to wear a wire during yard to hopefully catch an admission, threatening that prisoner with an extra two years to his sentence if he didn't wear it. Unfortunately, his interviews didn't get him an Answer, so he started becoming more harsh. Two and a half weeks after the death, he came into work hammered and grabbed me by the shoulders, telling me today was the beginning of the end. He then rounded up all the prisoners and announced to them that until the truth about who did it comes out, they would only be getting fed every second day. The backlash was brutal and the warden took that as a sign that the people protesting were guilty, got a hold of everyone who stepped out of line and ordered us, the guards, to beat them. Some guards, including myself, felt bad and didn't want to. But he threatened our jobs, saying if we're hesitating, then that means one of us must have called his daughter. He'd pace her.

Maya was the kind of teacher who got off on making students miserable. In AP history, he'd lean over your desk during tests, breathing coffee breath down your neck while tapping his pen on your paper, just to throw you off. And when he handed back essays drowned in red ink, he'd always had his favourite line in the real world, this wouldn't fly. I spent all junior year counting down to summer, marking days off my calendar like a prisoner, thinking I'd finally be free of his polyester blazers and power trips. So when I walked into the driver's ed two weeks later and saw him sitting behind the instructor's desk, my stomach dropped like a stone. Where do I turn? I asked during our first lesson, gripping the wheel nervously. You don't turn unless I say to, he barked, making me swerve slightly. Just assume you're going straight until I say otherwise. Though with your steering, straight is a pretty loose term. The two other girls in the backseat exchanged looks through the rearview mirror. When Sophia gripped the wheel too tight, he chuckled. Death grip won't help you drive better, sweetheart. This isn't a strength test. Emily stalled at a stop sign and he slapped his knee, laughing. And this is why I keep my seatbelt extra tight with you girls. Never know when We're gonna stop or if we're gonna stop. By the third lesson, we discovered his pattern. He'd make his nasty jokes for 20 minutes, then use the afternoon drives as nap time while we practiced highway driving. Don't worry about that curb you just kissed, said when I beard slightly. I'm sure it'll recover from the trauma. Unlike my neck. When Sophia asked about parallel parking, he laughed. You can barely handle forward parking and you wanna try parallel? That's adorable. He spent the entire next lesson bragging about his important dinner plans with his wife. If we survive today's lesson, that is three teenage girls driving. I should update my will. One afternoon, Sophia slightly veered and he exploded. Jesus, are you trying to collect mailboxes? Cause you're doing great. He wiped tears from laughing so hard. You know, girls like you three are why insurance rates are so high. And why driving instructors need hazard pay. It's funny because it's true. Then he made his final comparison. My five year old nephew has better control of his big wheel than you girls have of this car. He was still chuckling when he added, just try not to kill us while I. And then he was snoring, head tilted back against the headrest. I looked at Emily and Sophia in the rearview mirror and something passed between us. That's when I realised he told me to never turn unless he said so. The interstate entrance was coming up on The right, and I could see the big green sign marking I ninety five north hanging over the highway like a dare. I tilted my head slightly toward it and Emily caught my glance, following my eyes to the sign before whispering, I didn't hear him say turn, while Sophia nodded slowly and added me neither. I glanced down at the fuel gauge showing a full tank. Back at the sleeping Mister Maya, and as we approached the on ramp and I felt the car naturally wanting to continue straight onto the interstate, I took a deep breath and tightened my grip on the wheel. Well, he did say to follow his instructions exactly. The merge onto the interstate was smooth, and Mister Maya kept snoring while the highway stretched endlessly ahead. 30 minutes passed, then an hour, and his phone started buzzing in the cup holder with increasing frequency. We passed the welcome to New Jersey sign after two hours, making Emily stifle a nervous giggle as his phone lit up.

My little sister demanded I teach my study partner how to braid hair because she was convinced we were secretly in love. Emily was eight and had this weird obsession with my chemistry study partner, Conrad. Every Tuesday and Thursday when he'd come over, she'd magically appear with some urgent eight year old business. Can I show you my rock collection? Do you wanna see me do a cartwheel? Did you know I lost a tooth yesterday? Conrad was incredibly patient with her, always stopping whatever we were doing to admire her latest drawing or listen to her explain why unicorns were scientifically possible. I kept apologizing, but he just laugh and say she reminded him of his little cousins back home. He actually seemed to enjoy her interruptions, which made me like him even more. One Thursday, Emily cornered me in the kitchen while Conrad was in the bathroom. You need to teach Conrad how to braid hair, she whispered urgently. Why would I do that, M? Because when you guys get married and have daughters, he'll need to know how to do their hair for school. It's basic dad requirements. I nearly choked on my water. We're not getting married. We're just study partners. She rolled her eyes. He looks at you funny when you're working on equations. Like how dad looks at mom when she's making pancakes. Trust me, I'm very observant about Romance things. The next week, she orchestrated her master plan. Right before Conrad arrived, she accidentally left her favorite doll, Bella, in the living room, hair completely tangled. When Conrad walked in, Emily gasped dramatically, oh, no!

Just stood in the doorway, clutching my journal with white knuckles. This ends now, she said, her voice terrifyingly calm. No daughter of mine will be this. She couldn't even say the word lesbian. I tried explaining that I was still figuring things out, that it wasn't a big deal. But mom called dad in, showed him the pages. He looked more disappointed than angry, which somehow hurt worse. They scheduled an emergency appointment with Pastor Williams the next morning. Not a therapist, not someone trained in adolescent development. Their church pastor, who believed homosexuality was a choice. Listen. For three hours, I sat in his office while he explained how I was confused, how Satan was testing me. My parents nodded along to everything he said. Mom kept squeezing my hand when I tried to speak. The following week, they announced I was being sent to my aunt for the summer. For your spiritual health, mom said. What she didn't say was that my aunt ran a church camp specifically designed to fix kids like me. Camp restoration was nothing like the name suggested. No crafts or swimming or campfires. Just daily air sessions and one on one counseling that felt more like interrogations. We Were constantly monitored. No privacy in bathrooms, no unsupervised conversations with other campers. One. One night, a girl named Tara tried to run away. They caught her at the fence and made us all watch as they prayed over her for hours, calling out the demons of rebellion and perversion. Two weeks in, I developed a fever. Not just a slight temperature. I was burning up, delirious. The camp nurse gave me some painkillers and sent me back to group sessions. When I collapsed during prayer, they finally called my parents. Mom and dad drove eight hours to get me in the hospital.

I spent 15 years building the internet infrastructure for our small town in Nebraska. Everyone knew me as the internet guy. When your Wi-Fi went down at 2:00am, you called me. When you wanted faster speeds for your home office, I was your guy. What most people didn't know was that I didn't work for some big company. I, I owned every cable, every tower and every router box in town. I was the provider. Everything started falling apart when Jerry Davidson got elected to City Council. This guy had been gunning for me ever since I refused to give him free internet for his campaign office two years earlier. At the first town meeting, Jerry stood up with this big presentation about bringing in competition. We need options, said, pointing at charts showing how much cheaper national providers were. Alex has had a monopoly too long. The new company, Net Connect, rolled into town with promises nobody could refuse, half the price, double the speeds and a name people recognized from TV commercials. They set up a booth at the farmers market offering gift cards just for signing up. Within three months, I watched my customer base get cut in half. By six months, I had maybe 30 customers left out of 800. People stopped waving when they saw me around town. Mrs. Henderson, who used to bring me cookies every Christmas, wouldn't even make eye contact at the grocery store, at Pete's Diner, conversations would stop when I walked in. Some people actually laughed when Jerry made jokes about my outdated service during council meetings. Tried everything. Lowered my prices below cost, offered free installation, threw in premium channels. Nothing worked. Net connected poisoned the well. My savings account hit zero. My girlfriend Katie left me for some guy who worked at the bank. My business was circling the drain and I was three months behind on my truck payment. That's when I started reading contracts real carefully. See, Net Connect had signed a deal with the city to run their fiber cables through existing infrastructure. They were using my utility poles, my access boxes, and most importantly, my signal towers. The contract gave them access, but only if I granted maintenance permissions. Harry had been so excited to stick it to me that he never bothered reading the fine print. When the city originally gave me exclusive rights to install towers 15 years ago, I wrote a clause that let me shut down signal access with 60 days notice. Back then, it seemed like a smart way to protect my investment. Now it was my nuclear option. I spent three nights going through every page of every contract. It connects infrastructure piggyback completely on my original network backbone. They never laid fresh lines because it would have cost millions. They just plugged into what I'd already built and called it an upgrade. On a Tuesday morning, I walked into City Hall and filed my 60 day notice to terminate signal access. Jerry was there picking up some paperwork and saw me at the counter. He asked what I was doing with a smug grin on his face. Just some routine maintenance paperwork, I told him. Netconnect's lawyers showed up exactly one week later.

My 11 year old daughter started acting like a grown woman and I thought it was just early puberty stuff, but then I realized something much darker was happening. My daughter was one of those girls who hit puberty like a freight train. One month she was my little girl in Pokemon t shirts. The next month I was desperately searching the junior section because nothing in kids sizes would button across her chest. I started noticing the attention before I could pretend it wasn't happening. We were at target when she said casual as anything, that the man in electronics had followed us to three different aisles. She didn't sound scared, just stated it like a fact, like she was telling me it might rain. It got bad when she started consuming content that no 11 year old should even know existed. Her iPad history at 2:00am showed romance novels about CEOs and secretaries, bookmark folders labeled Dark Romance and Age Gap. She discovered Wattpad and archive of our own reading explicit stories about innocent girls and men who know better. Her YouTube algorithm had shifted completely. Makeup tutorials for that clean girl aesthetic. How to look expensive, feminine energy that drives men crazy. She was watching videos about how to walk in heels, how to make your voice sound more sultry, how to flirt without being obvious. When I tried to stop her from consuming that Content. She turned into someone I didn't recognize. He started using therapy speak to manipulate every conversation. I was gaslighting her when I set boundaries, being toxic when I said no to crop tops. Emotionally abusive for taking her phone at night. She'd Learned these words somewhere and weaponized them perfectly. Her friend group shifted overnight. The girls her age were suddenly so immature and childish. She gravitated toward eighth graders, then high schoolers, who'd wave at her during pickup. Started lying with disturbing ease. He was at the library, but really at Starbucks with older kids. At Emma's house, but actually at the mall. She figured out how to delete specific texts while keeping others clear. Only certain parts of her history created fake contact names. Emma mom was really someone named Tyler. She started sitting differently, legs crossed like an adult. Hand gestures while talking that she'd copied from somewhere. At family dinners, she'd insert her self into adult conversations about work, drama, and relationships, offering advice like she was 30. When we visited relatives, she spent the entire time with the adults, laughing at jokes she shouldn't understand, making comments about wine and coffee preferences. She didn't have. The secrets multiplied like cancer. Her phone became Fort Knox. Password changed weekly, face ID disabled so I couldn't use it. While she slept, she'd angle the screen away reflexively. Muscle memory from constant deception. I found out from another mom that my daughter had been telling everyone she was 16, not 11. With a whole fabricated backstory about being held back. Started lying about everything. Library visit. It's that were really mall trips with high schoolers, study groups that didn't exist. Sleepovers at houses I never heard of. Her bedroom door stayed locked constantly. Music blasting to cover phone conversation. She stopped talking to me entirely. Dinner became silent warfare. One word answers while scrolling under the table. Her former best friend's mom called concerned. Apparently, my daughter had told the girl she'd outgrown their friendship. At her spring concert, she wore the required black dress, but she'd altered it somehow. Taken in the waist, shortened the hem. She looked like a teenager, not an eleven year old. As she walked across the stage, I watched father's heads turn and follow her movement. These weren't strangers. They were soccer dads, TA volunteers. My neighbor. Their gazes lingered a bit too long before they caught themselves. But what disturbed me most was her awareness of it. She wasn't innocent to the attention anymore. She expected it and seemed to feed off it. After the performance, she didn't run to me like the other kids ran to their parents. She stood with the older performers, laughing at something on someone's phone. When I finally got her attention, she rolled her eyes and mouth. Five more minutes. Like I was embarrassing her. That night, I waited until she would.

My brother Jake has this girlfriend named Becca who literally cannot stand not being the center of attention for five minutes. Every family dinner, every holiday, every gathering, she finds a way to make it about her. Last Thanksgiving, she announced she was pregnant right when my dad was about to carve the Turkey. Turns out she wasn't even pregnant. Just wanted to see everyone's reactions. So when I was planning my wedding to my fiance Ryan, I knew I had to do something about the Becca situation. This was going to be my one day. The one day that was supposed to be about me and Ryan starting our life together. I called Jake about three months before the wedding. Hey, so about the wedding I started. I need to ask you something kind of awkward. What's up? He said, and I could hear him eating cereal in the background. I really don't want Becca there. I know that sounds harsh, but she always makes everything about herself, and I just can't deal with that stress. On my wedding day, the line went quiet for, like, 10 seconds, and Jake exploded. Are you serious right now? You're uninviting my girlfriend from your wedding? I'm not uninviting her because she was never invited in the first place. The invitation was just for you. That's the same thing. We've been together for two years. She's basically family. I tried To explain that it wasn't personal, that I just wanted one drama free day. But Jake wasn't having it. He said if Becca couldn't come, then he wouldn't come either. I told him that was his choice. Think he changed his mind? He didn't. But here's where it gets crazy. The day of my wedding, I'm getting my makeup done in the bridal suite when my cousin Madison bursts in. Uh, you need to see this, he says, shoving her phone in my face. It's Becca's Instagram story. She's posted, like, 15 videos of herself getting all dressed up, doing her makeup, picking out jewelry. The caption on the last one says, can't wait to celebrate love today. With a bunch of heart emojis and the location tagged as our wedding venue. My heart drops. He's coming anyway. Madison nods. Jake's outside right now, arguing with your dad about it. He says he changed his mind and decided to bring her. I'm standing there in my wedding dress, half my makeup done, and I have to deal with.

Dad left me at Grandpa's house when I was 11 because his new wife didn't want me around. I thought it was the worst thing ever. But Grandpa taught me everything about farming and business. Grandpa wasn't just some old farmer. He owned 500 acres of prime agricultural land worth millions. When dad was growing up, Grandpa was an alcoholic who barely kept the farm running. But by the time I arrived, he'd gotten sober and turned everything around. For seven years, it was just me and Grandpa. He taught me how to work cattle, manage crops, handle finances and run a business. We'd wake up at 5:00am every day, work until sunset, then he'd help me with homework. He never missed a single school event. When he died, he left me everything. Not just the land, the house, the equipment, the bank accounts, everything. I was 18 and suddenly owned more than most people see in a lifetime. Dad didn't even come to the funeral. Didn't call to check on me. Nothing. I spent the next 15 years building Grandpa's legacy. I turned the ranch into a successful agritourism operation. City families come stay for weeks, learning farm life. I also run a farmers market, sell organic beef and lease land to other farmers. Last year I cleared 800,000 dollar profit. Dad never Called once in 15 years. Not on my birthday, not on holidays, nothing. I sent him a graduation invitation when I finished my agriculture degree. He didn't show. When I got married three years ago, I didn't even bother inviting him. Then last week, out of nowhere, dad shows up at my door. Not to apologize, not to reconnect. He wanted to talk business. Turns out his precious daughter, my half sister, who I've met exactly twice, is struggling financially. Her husband lost his job, they're behind on their mortgage and she needs a fresh start. Dad figured I could just hand over some land and give her a management position. Family sticks together, he says with a straight face. The audacity was unbelievable. This man who abandoned his eleven year old son was lecturing me about family loyalty. I told him I'd think about it, hoping he'd get the hint and leave. Instead, he started texting me multiple times, daily. Detailed messages about which parcels of land would be perfect for his daughter. Suggestions about what roles she could fill in my business. Even ideas about where she and her husband could build a house. The messages got more demanding each day. She deserves this opportunity. Grandpa would have wanted this. You owe the family. It was like he thought my property was some kind of family commune he could just redistribute. After a week of constant harassment, I'd had enough. I called my friend Samuel, who's a local Police officer and asked him how to get a trespass order. Thirty minutes later, I walked out of the station with legal paperwork in hand. Then I asked another close friend, Peter, to take a road trip with me. I need backup for a family reunion. I told him. He didn't ask questions, just grabbed his keys. It took us 10 hours to drive to Dad's house. I needed that time to clear my head and plan exactly what I was going to say. Peter kept offering to drive, but I needed something to do with my hands while I processed everything. We pulled up to Dad's mom

But did she forget I still own the house? I'm a 35 year old electrician who's been working construction since I was 18. Built up a decent savings, bought my house when I was 28. A nice three bedroom ranch with a big backyard and a two car garage. Nothing fancy, but it was mine. Paid for with my own sweat and overtime hours. Two years ago, I married Amanda, who seemed responsible and down to earth as a mental hygienist. I kept the house in my name to protect my assets. After seeing my brother's messy divorce about six months ago, things changed. Amanda became critical of everything, started spending more time at the gym, bought new clothes, and often had late yoga classes. I wasn't born yesterday. The signs were all there, but I figured I'd let it play out and see what she was really up to. Last Tuesday, while working downtown, I got a text from Amanda. I'm done with this marriage. Change the locks. Brad's moving in this weekend. My lawyer will contact you about dividing assets. Add her personal trainer from the fancy gym across town. The pieces clicked into place immediately. I'm standing there in my work boots, tool belt around my waist, reading this message twice to make sure I understood it correctly. This woman really thought she could just me out of my own house and move her Boyfriend in like, some kind of real estate hostile takeover. My coworker Mike saw my face and asked what was wrong. I showed him the text, and he just started laughing. Dude, she knows you actually own that place, right? That's when it hit me. Amanda had always acted like we owned the house together, but she'd never seen the deed, never been involved in property taxes, never dealt with homeowners insurance. In her mind, marriage automatically meant shared ownership of everything. I called my buddy Steve, who's a real estate agent. Steve, remember how you said my house would sell fast in this market? How fast are we talking, Mark? With the location and condition, I could have buyers lined up by tomorrow. If you're serious. Dead serious. I need a cash buyer who can close in two weeks, max. What's the rush? Let's just say I'm dealing with some unwanted house guests. By Wednesday morning, Steve had three cash offers above asking price. I picked the highest one with the fastest closing date, exactly 12 days away. Thursday morning, I drove by the house to see Brad's lifted truck in my driveway, his motorcycle in my garage. The audacity was breathtaking. This guy was already making himself at home, probably thinking he'd hit the Jackpot with his new living situation. I parked across the street and called Amanda. She answered on the first ring, probably expecting me to beg to come home. Amanda, I hope you and Brad Are comfortable because you've got 11 days to enjoy the place. What are you talking about? I sold the house. Cash buyer closing next Friday. You'll need to be out by then. The silence stretched so long, I thought the call had dropped. Then she exploded. You can't sell our house without my permission. I'll sue you. Brad gave up his apartment lease. Actually, I can sell my house whenever I want. It's called property ownership. Maybe Brad should have checked the deed before giving up his lease. This is insane. Where are we supposed to go? Amanda, that became not my problem the second you changed my locks.

My cousin Rachel just buried her husband and two kids last week. Car accident took them all at once. She's left with just her five year old daughter, Emma. And honestly, watching them at the funeral was the most heartbreaking thing I've ever seen in my life. So my brother Jake and his wife Kelly show up to our house that morning. Before we head to the church, first thing Kelly does is announce she's pregnant. We're all getting ready for a funeral, and she's like, guess what, everyone, we have news. My mom congratulated her, but told her to keep it quiet for today out of respect. Did Kelly listen? Of course not. The second we get to the church, Kelly starts making these loud gagging noises and rubbing her completely flat stomach. Every time someone looked at her, she'd go, oh, sorry, morning sickness, I'm pregnant. You know, she kept saying stuff like, as a mom, I just can't imagine what Rachel's going through, which was ridiculous because Kelly doesn't have any kids yet. At the cemetery, she literally asked Rachel's sister to give up her seat so the pregnant lady could rest her feet. She'd been standing for like 10 minutes total. I was getting so annoyed, but I kept my mouth shut because it's a funeral. After the service, we went back to my aunt's house. Kelly kept making everything about herself. Someone would Mention how hard this must be for Rachel. And Kelly would jump in with, oh, I know. Now that I'm pregnant, I understand maternal instincts so much better. When people were talking about the babies who died, Kelly would rub her stomach and talk about how excited she was to be a mom. The bathroom thing was what really got me. Every time Kelly needed to use the bathroom, she'd announce, pregnant lady coming through or, baby on board needs to pee there. We're like 30 people there grieving, and she's treating it like her personal pregnancy announcement party. But then she crossed the line. Rachel was sitting quietly in the corner with Emma, both of them just completely destroyed. Kelly walks right up to them, sticks out her flat belly, and says, me and Jake just found out I'm pregnant. And honestly, we're beside ourselves thinking about how something like this could happen to us, too. Rachel completely broke down, started sobbing so hard she could barely breathe. Emma got scared and started crying, too. Everyone in the room just stopped and stared. That's when I lost it. I stood up and said, loud enough for everyone to hear, Kelly, no one gives a damn that you're pregnant. Look around you. This is a funeral for two babies and their father. You took that pregnancy test four days ago, and you're acting like you're the first woman to ever get pregnant. Just leave. Kelly started crying and ran out. Jake followed her, but not before calling me a fat, bitter witch in front of everyone. My aunt had to comfort Rachel while my mom took Emma outside. My phone's been blowing up all day with calls from Jake and Kelly's family calling me every name in the book. They're saying I made a pregnant woman cry and I'm heartless. Jake texted me that Kelly's so upset.

My dad said, we didn't think you'd wanna come since you barely finished school yourself. I just smiled and said, then don't worry about my ceremony next month. Two weeks later, my cousin posted a selfie standing under a banner with my face on it. That's when the call started. The banner read, Congratulations, Doctor Emma Mitchell, Suma Kumlaude. My phone exploded with notifications from family members who'd written me off years ago. See, my family always saw me as the failure. My brother Jake was the golden child. Straight A's, debate Captain, perfect everything. I had undiagnosed ADHD and struggle with C's and D's. Every dinner became an interrogation about my latest disappointment. Why can't you just apply yourself like Jake? My mom would ask, while my dad shook his head in silent judgment. Jake would sit there looking uncomfortable, but never defended me. The constant comparisons crushed my spirit until I stopped trying altogether. When I graduated high school, barely passing, they threw Jake a lavish party with extended family, friends and my parents colleagues for me. Hence dinner and a community college pamphlet. We have to be realistic about your capabilities, Emma, my dad said, sliding the brochure across the table like a consolation prize. I moved out the next day with just my Honda Civic and whatever fit in the trunk. My parents seemed almost relieved to see me go. Jake called once to ask Where I was staying, but the conversation was brief and awkward. I found a tiny studio apartment and took a job as a receptionist at a medical clinic to pay the bills. I visited for holidays, and during the pitying looks and pointed questions about when I would get serious about my future, they'd update me on Jake's achievements, his internships, his academic awards, his acceptance to prestigious MBA programs. I just nod and smile. What they didn't know was that working at the clinic had sparked something in me. I found the medical field fascinating, and several doctors noticed my natural aptitude for understanding complex aces. 1 physician, Doctor Ramirez took me under her wing. She recognized my ADHD symptoms immediately and helped me get properly diagnosed and treated. You have a brilliant mind, Emma, she told me. You just needed the right tools to access it. With her encouragement, I enrolled in night classes at the community college. For the first time in my life, I experience experienced academic success. My grades were stellar. I discovered that with proper support for my ADHD, I didn't just learn, I excelled. I transferred to a four year university, completed my undergraduate degree with honors, and was accepted to medical school. Throughout this journey, I maintained minimal contact with my family. Holiday visits became phone calls, then just text messages. They never asked about my education, assuming I was still working as a receptionist. A few times I tried mentioning my Classes. But my father would change the subject, and my mother would look uncomfortable. Jake was too busy with his own success to notice mine. Only Megan, my cousin on my mother's side, knew the truth. She always been kind to me, and when I told her about medical school, she became my biggest cheerleader. She attended every milestone. My white coat ceremony, my clinical rotations, my research present tentations. The day before Jake's NBA graduation dinner, I called my parents one last time. Are you sure there's no room for me tomorrow? I asked. Emma, we've been through this. My dad said it's for people who've actually accomplished something academically. That's when I knew I was done hiding. At my medical school graduation, Megan sat in the front row beaming

My best friend Claire was dying and needed me to make her a promise that would destroy my marriage. We were sitting in the hospice room while her three kids colored in the hallway when she grabbed my hand and asked me to adopt them after she was gone. Her boys were 11 and 9, and her daughter had just turned 7. Their dad had overdosed two years earlier, and with Claire's parents dead and her sister in Germany, there was nobody else. I wanted to say yes immediately, my husband had already told me that if I even considered taking them, we were done. Our son Caleb, was 12 and severely autistic, requiring constant supervision that consumed our entire lives. My husband worked nights so I could work days, and we tagged each other like wrestlers because Caleb couldn't be left alone for five minutes without potentially hurting himself. We hadn't been on a date in three years or had a conversation that wasn't about therapy, schedules, or medications. Adding three traumatized kids would push us past our breaking point, and he had made it clear he would leave before letting that happen. But Claire was the only person who showed up when Caleb was diagnosed while everyone else disappeared. She brought groceries when I couldn't leave the house and watched him during meltdowns so I could shower, and never acted like we were A. The social worker visited the day after Claire died, and the visit went exactly as I expected. Caleb had a meltdown when she arrived and spent 40 minutes hitting himself while I tried to calm him down. My husband stood in the corner with arms crossed while the social worker took notes and asked how we would manage three additional children when we were clearly overwhelmed. He laughed out loud at that question and walked out, slamming the door so hard the picture frames rattled. The kids were in emergency foster placement for 72 hours, then would be separated into different homes unless family stepped forward to take them. The oldest had started wetting the bed and refusing to eat, while the middle boy wouldn't speak and just sat humming and rocking. The little girl kept asking when Mommy was coming back from heaven. My husband found me crying in Caleb's room and delivered the ultimatum I had been dreading since Claire asked for my promise. If you do this, I'm filing for divorce and seeking primary custody of Caleb because you're being irresponsible with his care. The words came out flat and mechanical, the way he processed anything too heavy to feel. Part of me understood, because Caleb would suffer if we tried integrating three grieving children into our controlled routine. But the oldest had memorized every Pokemon and could talk about them for hours, which would connect with Caleb's identical obsession. The middle child moved like a Ghost and wouldn't disturb Caleb's need for predictability, while the little girl understood different meant special because Claire had taught her that these weren't random foster kids. The children who knew our house and called me Auntie, with nobody else who even knew their middle names. The foster family called that night because the little girl wouldn't stop screaming, and the oldest had tried running away twice looking for my house. The little girl's wailing came through the phone, begging for her mommy or me or anyone who smelled familiar. While the foster mother asked if I could fix this over the phone. My husband watched from the doorway as I lied that everything would work out when we both knew the system would swallow them whole. You can't save everyone, he said after I hung up. But the

I found out why at our wedding. I'm getting ready in the bridal suite, and my bridesmaids just left for coffee. Finally alone for a minute. Here's what you need to know about the man I'm about to marry. I moved across the country for him. California to Maine. Do you know how cold Maine is? But the way he looked at me at the airport that first day, holding that stupid handmade sign that said, my California sunshine made every frozen morning worth it. I nursed his mother through chemo last year. Held the okay while she threw up at 3:00am. Cleaned it, held her hand. She grabbed my face once between treatments and whispered, you saved my son. That's when I knew we were real family. When he lost his job, he went through the darkest six months. Some days, I'd have to guide him to the shower, help him remember to eat. He'd play call of duty until 4:00am because he said it was the only thing that kept the anxiety quiet. But watching him fight through it, watching him slowly come back to life, that's real love. When he finally got better, he proposed by hiding the ring in my first edition Harry Potter, the one my grandmother left me. He was so nervous, he accidentally cut too deep and destroyed the binding. He literally cry. I'd when he realized what he'd done. Still checks every antique bookstore. We passed, determined to find a replacement. That's my future husband. He messes up, but never stops trying to fix it. Now, I knew we couldn't afford a very lavish wedding, but the main thing I wanted was for my wedding dress to have pockets. I know, silly, but I needed something to hold on to when I get nervous. Something that's just mine. Searched everywhere for months. Finally found this ivory silk dress with hidden pockets so deep I could bury my whole hands. Don't care about lace or beating or whatever. Just wanted those pockets. My mom says I'm weird, but my fiance gets it. He always gets me. The ceremony is beautiful. He actually cries when he sees me. His mother, cancer free now, mouths thank you, and I almost lose it. The photographer whispers, we're the most in love couple she's ever shot. Everyone's crying happy tears. My dad actually smiles for the first time since mom died. We wrote our own vows. He looks me in the eyes and promises to always be honest and never keep secrets, as he can't wait to start a family when the time is right. I believe him. Every single word. Reception starts, and his coworker shows up late looking green. Like, actually green. She keeps staring at me during dinner. With his face. It's like. Like she's at a funeral. I saw her try to approach me twice, but my husband intercepts. She's drunk, he says. But I'm Watching her. She's drinking water during our cake cutting. She's sobbing in the corner. Not pretty tears. Ugly crying. My hands find my pockets. That nervous thing I do when I noticed there's paper. Thick paper. I excuse myself to the bathroom, and the coworker follows me, mascara streaming down her face. I'm so sorry. I tried to tell you before. My heart's pounding. Tell me what? He's gasping between sobs. Check your pocket. I paid your Taylor to put it there. You deserve to know. Then she bolts. I can't breathe. My hands shake as I pull out the paper. It's a sonogram. Three months old. On the back and purple pen. I'm keeping it. You deserve to know.

I tried to explain to the six armed officers that I didn't know anything about any murders, but my neighbor Karen held up her iPad, showing a Powerpoint titled Serial Killer Next Door evidence by Karen. She flipped to the first evidence slide, looking at me with a smug I got you this time, Beach Express. It began three months ago, Karen said, like a modern day Sherlock Holmes. She noticed I kept odd hours and had blackout curtains on all my windows. The first incident happened when she saw me dragging heavy black garbage bags to my car at two in the morning. The next day, she found red stains all over my driveway that looked exactly like blood. She started documenting everything for the safety of the neighborhood. He would have delivery trucks come to this house at night with tattooed men unloading large packages and body sized boxes. He took every single one down to his garage and came out with black bags once he's finished the job. Our other neighbors who had come out to check on the scene gasped at the horrific Powerpoint. Full pictures of the men, the suspicious truck, and me wearing protective eyeglasses and an apron stained with something red. Karen flipped through more extensive evidence. Photos of body parts visible through my garage window, recordings of Bonesaw sounds at midnight, even a video of me splashed with a Red liquid while holding a chainsaw. I'm telling you now. Oh, it's not what it looks like, I said, trying to hold back my laughter. Karen laughed. We're not blind. Don't even try to play your tricks on us. You're just another Jason wannabe. Jason Derulo? I teased. What the. No. Jason Vorhees from those horror films? You know what? Never mind. She flipped through more pieces of evidence. The ring doorbell recording of me handing over a red stain in suitcase to the delivery men, and a picture of a shrunken head in my car. When the officers saw the footage of a victim who sat in my living room, pale and unmoving, they panicked. Check the property. Start with the garage. Go! The officers entered my garage with weapons drawn and found mannequins on professional racks with latex limbs hanging to dry. They found containers of the red liquid labeled corn syrup mix Episode 6 and a toy chainsaw tagged testing zombie scene 4B. They clicked on different files from my computer, listening to different creepy sound effects and screams. Oh, hey, wasn't this on strange? Your things on something, one officer said, recognizing one of the props. He whistled at the three thousand dollar invoice attached. Another officer picked up the body part that was seen on Karen's Powerpoint and realized it was just foam latex. They brought out a few of them to the lawn. Karen's hands shook as she picked up the lightweight props. I Don't understand, she mumbled. That's when I explained everything. I used to work corporate until I lost my job. And I figured, you know, maybe I could start over, do something I really loved. So I got into special effects, became an artist. I loved horror movies and wanted to make

The bride's name isn't Susie. My best friend Janice was literally mid vow when Father Angelo raised his hand and said, I'm sorry, but I need to ask something. Where is Susie? Everyone in the church went dead silent because we all knew the bride's name wasn't Susie. The groom's face went white and Janice's voice cracked when she said, who's Susie? I stood there as maid of honor, holding her bouquet, watching her eyes fill with tears just thinking her fiance had another woman. An elderly woman in the back stood up and pointed directly at me. That's her! That's Susie! The whole church turned to stare at me, include putting my best friend Janice. But I was just as confused as everyone was in the room. My mom rushed out of her pew and ran to the altar before the old woman could finish walking down the aisle. Mom grabbed my arm, trying to pull me away from the ceremony. We need to leave right now! Janice grabbed my other arm, crying, did you sleep with my fiance? Mom tugged my arm harder. The old woman reached the altar and slammed her cane down onto the marble floor with a bang. Please let me speak to my granddaughter in peace before it's too late. The entire congregation whispered with questions and rumors. My mom hissed, stay away from us! Everyone stared at her like she was crazy. The Old woman ignored her, pulling out a travel sized photo album. This is your father holding you as a baby. This is you in my arms. This is our family. The kind looking man in the photos looked exactly like me. Same eyes, same hair color, even same smile. My mom tried to grab them, screaming, you have no right to do this here! This is a wedding! She deserves to know her father loved her and that he left this world trying to find her. She yelled back in a voice so clearly in pain that it made the entire church go quiet. My Grandmother's voice calmed. Your mother took you away when you were just a toddler. Changed her name, changed yours. But by some miracle, I found you. Now we can be complete again. She held out her hand with a soft smile. Please. I nearly grabbed it until my mom burst out with a horrifying truth. Took her away number. There was a restraining order against you. The church gasped, watching more drama slowly unfold. Ask her why, my mom demanded confidently. I looked at my grandma, whose face now changed from sweet and sympathetic to something cold and judgmental. She kept her mouth shut. My mom laughed. That's right. You can't say it, can you? Your grandmother drove your father to his last breath. She is the reason he's gone. And the reason I fled with you in my arms on the night before the Funeral. You poisoned him against his own family. My grandmother screamed back, slamming her cane against the floor again, this time with shaking hands. Even now you deny it. Right there at the altar, my mom announced the truth. My grandmother had refused to believe her son had bipolar disorder and needed medication. She kept telling him the doctors were wrong.

Growing up, my sister Kayla made everything about her. My birthday parties, she got gifts, too, because I wouldn't exist without her. Every graduation, every achievement hijacked. When I won the science fair in 8th grade, she convinced my parents to throw her a supportive sister party the same night. When I got into college, she announced her engagement at my Celebration dinner. When I graduated with honors, she showed up in a revealing red dress and spent the whole ceremony flirting with professors. The pattern never stopped. Kayla had this way of making herself the victim.

I was the one lending her money she never paid back. I was the one covering for her when she bailed on family obligations. When I got engaged to my Indian fiance, Priya, I was terrified Kayla would find a way to ruin it. Sure enough, at our engagement party, she immediately joked about wearing white to our wedding. It'll be so funny, she laughed, like in the movies, I'll be the mysterious woman in white. She even made this dramatic pose, hand on her forehead like some soap opera actress. I pulled her aside and told her, absolutely not. This is my one day. Kayla, please. She rolled her eyes and said I was being dramatic, that it was just a joke. God, you're so sensitive. It's not like anyone would actually confuse me for the bride. But she seemed to agree to drop it. Two weeks later, I found out she'd gone behind my back and asked Priya directly, your sister seems really excited about her dress choice. Priya mentioned casually over dinner, she kept asking about fabric and styles. My blood ran cold. I knew exactly what that meant. I freaked out on Priya explaining Kayla's entire history of stealing my moments. She did this at my high school graduation, wore this attention grabbing red dress and flirted with all the dads. My college graduation, she announced her pregnancy. She'll definitely show up in some elaborate white gown designed to make everyone look at her instead of us. That night, I had a complete breakdown, sobbing, hyperventilating. 28 years of suppressed resentment came pouring out. I was convinced Priya would see my toxic family dynamics and run for the hills. Who wants to marry into that kind of drama? Instead, she held me and said something genius. You know, white isn't the bridal color in Indian weddings, right? I froze. In all my panic about Kayla's manipulation tactics, I completely forgotten that crucial detail. Kayla had no idea Priya would be wearing a stunning red lehenga with intricate gold embroidery. Wedding day arrives. I'm getting ready with my groomsmen when my cousin Texts, dude, your sister just walked in looking like she thinks she's the bride. My stomach dropped until I remembered Priya's words. Then I actually started laughing. Kayla struts in wearing this elaborate white ball gown, strapless with a cathedral train, clearly custom made and expensive. She'd even hired a professional makeup artist, had her hair done in an elaborate updo with white flowers. The confused looks from Priya's family were absolutely priceless. Indian weddings are vibrant, colorful celebrations. And here's Kayla looking like she wandered in from a completely different century. During the ceremony, I kept glancing at Kayla. She looked increasingly uncomfortable as she realized everyone was staring at her for all the wrong reasons. Priya looked absolutely radiant in her traditional red and gold.

I came home from grocery shopping to find thirteen year old Adrian in the living room surrounded by the massacred remains of every single one of two year old Burt's beloved toys. Cotton stuffing everywhere like snow, fabric torn to shreds scattered across the carpet. Burt was screaming so hard his face was purple, while my husband stood over Adrian shouting she's lost her mind! Pointing at the destruction with a shaking finger. I was watching TV with Bert and she just started ripping apart every toy he owns like a psycho. I dropped the grocery bags and ran to pick up Bert, who is sobbing, trying to piece together his favorite teddy bear. Adrian, what have you done? She looked up at me with tears streaming down her face, holding something in her closed fist while my husband grabbed her hard enough to leave marks. Put something shiny in his mouth, she shouted, yanking her hand away from her father. I asked him where he got it and he pointed at his teddy bear. And when I looked inside, I found these. She opened her hand to show a diamond ring, a gold necklace, and several earrings. That's when my husband's face went from angry to a flash of panic. You had no right to destroy his toys over some costume jewelry, he quickly stammered. They were hidden inside the teddy bear, Adrian said, looking At me instead of her father, her voice trembling but determined. Burt could have to death. And I saw dad in here last week with his sewing kit, saying he was fixing rips. My husband laughed, but it sounded forced. I was fixing them because they were falling apart. And that's just jewelry I found at work during my security rounds, he said. I picked up one of the destroyed bears and found a small, neat slit in the back that had been hand sewn shut. The jewelry inside wasn't cheap like he said. It was real diamonds catching the light. You hid jewelry in our baby's toys? I asked. I was going to pawn it, my husband said quickly, but his voice was getting higher and sweat was beating on his forehead. Extra money for the family. You know how tight things have been. The elephant had three rings, the rabbit had a bracelet and earrings. The Dinosaur had a watch. Every single toy had something metal inside that could have killed bird if he swallowed it, Adrian said. You're being dramatic, my husband responded. I made sure the holes were secure, he then stammered. Why not just keep them in a drawer? I asked, staring at jewelry scattered across the floor. Why hide them in baby toys? My husband tried to grab the jewelry from the table, but Adrian was faster, pooping it up and backing away toward the wall. I know why he hid them in the Toys! Adrian said. Give those to me right now! My husband suddenly shot up, moving toward her with his hands outstretched. Adrian ran behind me, pressing against my back. This necklace has an engraving, Adrian said, her voice shaking as she held up a silver chain that caught the light. It says to Ruby, love, mom, on the back. Who's Ruby? I asked innocently. My husband's face started turning. And

My son Brandon texted happy birthday, mom to our family group chat on the wrong day. When I corrected him, he said, close enough, mom. I turned 70 alone that year. Meanwhile, they threw my grandchildren's other grandmother, penny, a surprise 65th with 50 guests and a string quartet. I know because I saw the photos on Facebook. They captioned it, celebrating the world's best grandma. When I had hip surgery, I took the bus home because Brandon was slammed at work and couldn't leave. My daughter Kenzie, had a thing with the kids. Prepared meals standing on a walker, refilled prescriptions myself. Slept in the recliner because I couldn't manage stairs alone. Two months later, Kenzie's mother in law had her gallbladder removed. Kenzie moved in for three weeks. Brandon delivered groceries daily. They hired a private nurse. I watched their children for free every summer while they vacationed in Europe. 10 years of summers. No thank you, no payment. Just mom has nothing else to do. Anyway, they told friends childcare was taken care of like I was hired help. I missed my late husband Gio's sister's funeral because they already booked non refundable tickets. Kensley's mother in law babysits twice a year. They pay her $500 each time because her time is valuable. Christmas morning, I sat alone until 4 p m. Because they went to Kensley's husband David's family first. Traffic was bad, Kinsley explained. Though they live closer to me, my gift was a drugstore candle still priced at three dollars and ninety nine cents. Penny got a weekend spa retreat. I painted Kinsley's wedding portrait for three months. She left it in the basement untouched. Penny's blurry phone photo got framed in gold on the mantle. Kinsley asked me to cater her dinner party, then introduced me as the help when I stayed to serve. The next week, she hired a two thousand dollar chef for Penny's Book Club of six and then drove past my house to take penny grocery shopping during the ice storm that trapped me inside for four days. She doesn't like driving in bad weather, he explained. When I called hungry, neither do I. I said, you'll figure it out, mom. You always do. They started lying to maintain the favoritism. Kenzi told me Thanksgiving was canceled. Family flew. I delivered homemade soup to their door and saw Penny's car in the driveway and heard laughter inside. I walked back to my car crying. When Geo died, they invited penny to the family only viewing. I found out when she hugged me there, saying how honored she felt to be included in such an intimate moment. My own sister wasn't invited because Kenzi said immediate family only. Then something unexpected happened. Penny had been entertaining her country club with story. Kensley confided in her Brandon's fertility struggles, Kensley's anxiety medication, their financial problems. It exploded at a charity Auction. When her drunk friend asked Kensley about her little Prozac situation in front of everyone, Kensley discovered penny had been calling them my son's burden at her book club for years. The woman they'd chosen over me had made them her punchline. After Dio's funeral, I started teaching painting at the community center. Eight year old Manny arrived first. Suspended from school, his grandmother working doubles. I handed him a brush. He stabbed the canvas with rage, then returned the next day. Soon, seven neighborhood kids sprawled across my living room floor, turning feelings into colors. I invited Kensley to see Manny's first painting. Can't today, mom. Maybe later. Later never came. Brandon promised to attend our art show. He forgot. The kids started calling me Grandma D. Their parents invited me to every recital, game, graduation. I taught them Geo's cloud technique, while my own grandchildren didn't know I painted. Three years passed. Manny got into art school with our portfolio. Aisha painted a mural on my garage. Deshawn sold his first painting, bought me roses. My refrigerator bloomed with their art. My phone buzzed with goodnight, Grandma D texts. Meanwhile, I kept reaching out, offered Kinsley painting lessons for her kids there

Growing up, my sister Kayla made everything about her. My birthday parties, she got gifts, too, because I wouldn't exist without her. Every graduation, every achievement hijacked. When I won the science fair in eighth grade, she convinced my parents to throw her a supportive sister party the same night. When I got into college, she announced her engagement at my Celebration dinner. When I graduated with honors, she showed up in a revealing red dress and spent the whole ceremony flirting with professors. The pattern never stop. Kayla had this way of making herself the victim whenever I achieved anything. You're so lucky, she'd say. I sacrificed so much for you growing up.

My dad said, we didn't think you'd want to come since you barely finished school yourself. I just smiled and said, then don't worry about my ceremony next month. Two weeks later, my cousin posted a selfie standing under a banner with my face on it. That's when the call started. The banner read, Congratulations, Doctor Emma Mitchell, Suma Kumlaude. My phone exploded with notifications from family members who'd written me off years ago. See, my family always saw me as the failure. My brother Jake was the golden child. Straight A's, debate Captain, perfect everything. I had undiagnosed ADHD and struggled with C's and D's. Every dinner became an interrogation about my latest disappointment. Why can't you just apply yourself like Jake? My mom would ask, while my dad shook his head in silent judgment. Jake would sit there looking uncomfortable, but never defended me. The constant comparisons crushed my spirit until I stopped trying altogether. When I graduated high school, barely passing, they threw Jake a lavish party with extended family, friends and my parents colleagues. For me, a tense dinner and a community college pamphlet. We have to be realistic about your capabilities, Emma, my dad said, sliding the brochure across the table like a consolation prize. I moved out the next day with just my Honda Civic and whatever fit in the trunk. My parents seemed almost relieved to. Jake called once to ask where I was staying, but the conversation was brief and awkward. I found a tiny studio apartment and took a job as a receptionist at a medical clinic to pay the bills. I visited for holidays and during the pitying looks and pointed questions about when I would get serious about my future, they'd update me on Jake's achievements, his internships, his academic awards, his acceptance to prestigious NBA programs. I just nod and smile. What they didn't know was that working at the clinic had sparked worked something in me. I found the medical field fascinating, and several doctors noticed my natural aptitude for understanding complex cases. One physician, Doctor Ramirez, took me under her wing. She recognized my ADHD symptoms immediately and helped me get properly diagnosed and treated. You have a brilliant mind, Emma, she told me. You just needed the right tools to access it. With her encouragement, I enrolled in night classes at the community college. For the first time in my life, I experience experienced academic success. My grades were stellar. I discovered that with proper support for my ADHD, I didn't just learn, I excelled. I transferred to a four year university, completed my undergraduate degree with honors, and was accepted to medical school. Throughout this journey, I maintained minimal contact with my family. Holiday visits became phone calls, then just text messages. They never asked about my education, assuming I was still working as a receptionist. Few times I tried mentioning my classes. But my father would change the subject, and my mother would look uncomfortable. Jake was too busy with his own success to notice mine. Only Megan, my cousin on my mother's side, knew the truth. She'd always been kind to me, and when I told her about medical school, she became my biggest cheerleader. She attended

My mom has been begging me to put more thought into my appearance for as long as I can remember. I always ignored her because I thought I just look normal. But then she started insulting how I look every day. One morning she stood behind me at breakfast side dramatically and said, for God's sake, just do something different with your hair at least. It would make a world of difference. Just try something new, she pleaded. Anything would be more interesting to girls than this. She pointed to my ruffled head for some reason. That was the last straw. I said sure thing and headed to the bathroom with a new sense of purpose. I started small with a middle part and enough gel to make it look like plastic. Mom seemed pleased at first until she realized I'd used her expensive salon gel and the entire forty dollar bottle gone. It takes product to make changes, I reminded her when she found the empty container. She had to explain to her hairdresser why she needed more gel after one day, and the woman judged her hard for letting her teenage son waste professional products. The next week I went to her barber without telling her and got a perm. Not a settle wave, but a full 1980 style perm that made me look like a poodle. Mom had to Take me to her cousin's engagement party looking like I'd stuck my finger in an electrical socket, and everyone kept asking if it was for a school play. He's experimenting with his look, she explained weekly while her relatives took photos that would definitely end up in the family group chat. Then I discovered temporary hair chalk and started changing colors daily to match my outfits. Blue on Monday, red on Tuesday, purple on Wednesday, leaving colorful smudges on every pillow, towel, and headrest in the house. Mom's white couch looked like a rainbow had died on it, and she had to explain to guests why everything in our house was stained with pastels. Her car's leather seats were permanently tinted pink from the time I wore magenta in the rain. I showed up to her office when she forgot her lunch, sporting tiny braids with ribbon woven through them that I'd spent six hours creating. Her co workers tried not to laugh as I hugged her in front of everyone, leaving her blazer covered in the baby powder I'd used to make the braids look distinguished. Her boss asked if I was going through something, and she had to smile and say she encouraged me to express myself. The man bun phase was particularly rough for her, as I grew it out just long enough to make the world's smallest bun that stuck straight up like an antenna. She had to sit behind me at church while people watched My tiny bun wobble during hymns. The pastor's wife asked if I was becoming Buddhist, and mom had to have a whole conversation about religious tolerance. Then came the frosted tips. Except I didn't go to a salon and used actual cake frosting at first because I misunderstood the term. Mom found me in the bathroom covered in vanilla icing, and even after I used real bleach, my tips were orange instead of blonde. She had to take me to get school photos looking like Guy Fieri's younger brother, and those pictures would haunt us forever. I invested in a crimping iron and started crimping random sections so my head looked like I've been partially electrocuted. Mom begged me to stop, but I reminded her she wanted interesting and nothing was more interesting than asymmetrical crimp. Her mother came to visit and asked why mom was letting me walk around looking like I'd survived a lightning strike. The oils came next. So much hair oil that I looked wet constantly and left grease stains on everything I touched. Mom had to replace three pillowcases and explain to the

I'm a family court clerk, and last week the medinas were divorcing and fighting over who gets to keep the house, claiming the other was too financially reckless to own property. Both kept presenting evidence. He bought a year supply of healing crystals for our cat. He bought a boat. We live in Arizona. She hired a life coach for her succulent plants. Mediator Betty looked like she needed a drink at 9 a m. I'd like to hear from your daughter, since she's listed as a witness. Lola walks in dressed like a tiny accountant, dragging two suitcases and a filing cabinet. She looked like she was moving in permanently. Mediator Betty stares at the luggage mountain. Lola, we're just having a conversation. With all due respect, ma'am, you haven't met my parents. Going to need evidence. Can you tell us about your parents money habits? Lola opens the first suitcase and pulls out a binder. I brought three years of receipts. Receipts? Yes, ma'am. Filed under evidence. My parents shouldn't have credit cards. Betty almost spits out her coffee. Excuse me. Lola opens to a page with colorful charts. I've been tracking their spending since I was 11, ma'am. What kind of spending? Let's start with exhibit A. Lola holds up a next statement. This is Mom's fourth treadmill. She buys a new one every year because this one will be different. They're all in the garage. We Call it the treadmill graveyard. Exhibit B. Dad bought a three thousand dollar espresso machine. He only drinks instant coffee, ma'am. He thought it would inspire him to upgrade. Exhibit C. Mom orders Doordash from the restaurant that's literally next door. Last month she paid forty seven dollars for a twelve dollar sandwich. The restaurant is 40 feet away. And exhibit D, or dad belongs to three different gyms because each one has that special machine. He pays one hundred twenty dollars a month total. He goes twice a month. That's six. $60 per workout. Betty is covering her mouth. Lola, how did you start handling the money? Someone had to pay the electric Bill, ma'am. They kept forgetting it wasn't on auto pay. Lola opens the second suitcase. This is Mom's online boutique phase. She bought wholesale designer handbags from sketchy websites. Our garage looks like a knockoff purse museum. She sold exactly three bags. How. How much did she spend? $8,000, made $75 back. The mediator turns to the mom Missus, Medina. They looked real in the pictures. Lola continues. Dad's no better. He bought a truck to flip it. He put $5,000 of modifications on it. Damaged LED lights underneath that only light pink. And an attached disco ball inside. It's now worth less than before he bought it. May I present exhibit E. Lola pulls out two jars from the filing cabinet. This jar contains all the warranties dad bought that we've actually used. It's empty. This jar contains receipts for every warranty he's purchased. 83 warranties totaling $4,200. You never know when you'll need them. Dad protests. Dad, you bought a 3 year warranty on a 12 dollar phone case. The warranty cost 15 dollars. Lola pulls out a credit card Bill. Mom has a storage unit for her Amazon returns she never returned. She's paying 150 dollars a month to store things she doesn't want. I'll return them eventually. Mom, some of these boxes are from 2,018. What about your father? Betty asks. Dad bought a fishing boat. He gets seasick. He's used it once and threw up. He had to be towed.

My aunt literally hid her purse in her car trunk when she saw me walking up to my grandparents 60th wedding anniversary party. Through the window, I watched my uncle whisper something to his wife and she immediately took off her diamond earrings and shoved them in her pocket. 28 years old and my family still treated me like I was about to rob them blind because I got arrested for shoplifting when I was 15. The whole extended family was there for the anniversary Celebration, which meant I got to experience the full spectrum of their paranoia and disgust. My cousin made a big show of counting the bottles in the liquor cabinet loud enough for everyone to hear while staring directly at me, just making sure we know what we started with. He announced to the room like he was doing everyone a favor. My mother pulled me aside and whispered that she'd already warned everyone to keep their medications locked up because we can't be too careful with your history. I haven't touched anything stronger than coffee in eight years, but she still introduces me to people as her troubled one who's trying to get back on track. My uncle took it to another level when I walked past the room where they piled everyone's coats and he literally stood guard in the doorway blocking my path. The bathroom is the other direction. He Said with this smug little smile that made me want to scream. The anniversary dinner was even worse because they stuck me at the overflow table in the kitchen with the kids under 10, even though there were empty seats in the dining room. One of the teenagers asked why I was sitting with them, and my aunt loudly explained that sometimes adults need to provision 2, which got a huge laugh from the other room. While everyone else ate off my grandmother's China, I got a plastic plate because apparently I couldn't be trusted with anything breakable. My uncle kept walking through to check on things, which meant staring at me like I might pop get the salt shakers while his wife counted the silverware drawer right in front of me. Then my uncle decided to move my grandmother's antique mirror to the garage because he didn't trust me around something that valuable. He was carrying it through the dining room, making another speech about family heirlooms and personal responsibility when he tripped over his own grandson's toy truck and went straight through the sliding glass door. The mirror shattered and a huge shard went straight into his thigh while smaller pieces sliced his arms and neck. Bloods started spurting everywhere in these rhythmic pulses, and everyone just stood there screaming while he turned white and started losing consciousness. My aunt was freaking about calling 9, 1 1, but fumbling with her phone and dropping it in the blood While my mother fainted and my cousin vomited on the carpet, I jumped over the kitchen table and slid through the blood to get to him while ripping off my belt in one motion. Nobody touch anything and someone get me clean towels, vodka from the freezer and super glue from the junk drawer. Now I barked while using my knee to apply pressure above the wound. The femoral artery was nicked and he had maybe three minutes before he bled out. So I used my belt as a tourniquet while everyone stood there frozen. Another cousin finally brought supplies while I worked to stop the bleeding from his neck with one hand and maintained pressure with my knee. When the emts burst through the door seven minutes later, one of.

My best friend Claire was dying and needed me to make her a promise that would destroy my marriage. We were sitting in the hospice room while her three kids colored in the hallway when she grabbed my hand and asked me to adopt them after she was gone. Her boys were 11 and 9, and her daughter had just turned seven. Their dad had overdosed two years earlier, and with Claire's parents dead and her sister in Germany, there was nobody else. I wanted to say yes immediately, my husband had already told me that if I even considered taking them, we were done. Our son Caleb was 12 and severely autistic, requiring constant supervision that consumed our entire lives. My husband worked nights so I could work days, and we tagged each other like wrestlers because Caleb couldn't be left alone for five minutes without potentially hurting himself. We hadn't been on a date in three years or had a conversation that wasn't about therapy, schedules, or medications. Adding three traumatized kids would push us past our breaking point, and he had made it clear he would leave before letting that happen. But Claire was the only person who showed up when Caleb was diagnosed while everyone else disappeared. She brought groceries when I couldn't leave the house and watched him during meltdowns so I could shower, and never acted like we were A burden. The social worker visited the day after Claire died, and the visit went exactly as I expected. Caleb had a meltdown when she arrived and spent 40 minutes hitting himself while I tried to calm him down. My husband stood in the corner with arms crossed while the social worker took notes and asked how we would manage three additional children when we were clearly overwhelmed. He laughed out loud at that question and walked out, slamming the door so hard the picture frames rattled. The kids were in emergency foster placement for 72 hours, then would be separated into different homes unless family stepped forward to take them. The oldest had started wetting the bed and refusing to eat, while the middle boy wouldn't speak and just sat humming and rocking. The little girl kept asking when Mommy was coming back from heaven. My husband found me crying in Caleb's room and delivered the ultimatum I had been dreading since Claire asked for my promise. If you do this, I'm filing for divorce and seeking primary custody of Caleb because you're being irresponsible with his care. The words came out flat and mechanical, the way he processed anything too heavy to feel. Part of me understood, because Caleb would suffer if we tried integrating three grieving children into our controlled routine. But the oldest had memorized every Pokemon and could talk about them for hours, which would connect with Caleb's identical obsession. The middle child moved like A ghost and wouldn't disturb Caleb's need for predictability, while the little girl understood different meant special because Claire had taught her that these weren't random foster kids, but children who knew our house and called me Auntie with nobody else who even knew their middle names. The foster family called that night because the little girl wouldn't stop screaming and the oldest had tried running away twice looking for my house. The little girl's wailing came through the phone, begging for her mommy or me or anyone who smelled familiar. While the foster mother asked if I could fix this over the phone. My husband watched from the doorway as I lied that everything would work out when we both knew the system would swallow them whole. You can't save everyone, he said after I

Growing up, my brother Andrew could literally burn the house down, and mom would blame the matches. When he was 12, he actually did set our garage on fire trying to make a flamethrower. Mom's response was, boys will be boys. At least he's being creative. Meanwhile, I graduated valedictorian and she missed my ceremony because Andrew had a headache that day. Every morning, Andrew got gourmet breakfasts while I ate generic cereal. When report cards came out, my straight A's got a nod, while his C+ in math warranted a Celebration dinner because he really tried his best. Christmas mornings were the worst. Mountains of wrapped gifts for Andrew, practical stuff like socks and school supplies for me. When dad got cancer during my junior year, everything got worse. I was juggling AP classes, working at the library, and helping with dad's medications. Mom hired Andrew a private tutor so the stress wouldn't hurt his precious. The average I was staying up until 3:00am studying after spending hours cleaning up around the house. Dad passed two months before my graduation. Even then, mom barely acknowledged my valedictorian speech because Andrew was having a really hard time. He skipped the ceremony, entirely too emotional. So mom stayed home with him instead of watching me graduate. College was brutal. Despite dad setting up a fun for both of us, it mysteriously disappeared into medical bills. I scrambled for scholarships and loans while mom somehow found money to send Andrew to an expensive sports academy in Florida. He quit after three weeks because the vibe wasn't right. That program cost more than my entire freshman year tuition. I worked my behind off Dean's list every semester. Two part time jobs, living in a tiny apartment shared with three guys. Meanwhile, Andrew was home rent free, finding himself through expensive hobbies. Mom happily funded gaming setup worth $2,000 that's now collecting dust. Season tickets for his sports blogging phase that lasted two months. Fast forward 10 years. I'm killing it as a senior consultant. Finally paid off my loans, living in a nice apartment. Andrew is still at home at 28, trying to become a fitness influencer or whatever his latest phase is. Andrew started texting me about investment advice and business ideas. Mom calling more frequently, making comments about success for children, supporting their parents, sending me articles about family wealth management. I knew something was coming. Last Saturday morning, they show up unannounced. Mom pushes past me into my apartment, doesn't even wait for an invitation. First thing she does is look around like she's appraising the place. Nice setup you got here, she says, running her fingers along my coffee table. Must be doing pretty well for yourself. Andrew flops down on my couch like he owns it. Immediately pulls out his phone, doesn't even say hello. Then mom pulls out an actual spreadsheet. She sits down across from me and spreads it on my dining table like we're having a business meeting. I've been thinking about your family obligations. She starts. You owe me roughly $150,000 for raising you. Medical bills, school supplies, food, housing. I kept all the receipts. She's pointing to different lines on her spreadsheet. Completely serious. Plus, Andrew's got this amazing business opportunity. Fitness coaching app. Revolutionary concept. He just needs about $75,000 to get started. And with your connections, I'm sitting there listening to this insanity, thinking about all those years.

But now the truth came out. I was 22, just started my dream job as a mechanic, when my phone exploded with hate messages. My 16 year old cousin Sarah told everyone I've been sneaking into her room and got her pregnant. Nobody asked for my side. My mom screamed through tears that I was disgusting, asking how she raised such a monster. Dad just hung up on me. My sister Emma blocked me on everything without a word. Even my grandmother, who practically raised me after my parents divorce, hung up crying, saying she was too ashamed to talk to me. Sarah was the family princess. Straight A's, honor roll, church, youth group leader. Every Sunday, I was the high school dropout. Within 24 hours, the whole extended family had turned against me. My aunt posted these long Facebook rants about protecting our children from creeps hiding in our own family. My uncles were leaving voicemails, threatening to beat the hell out of me if they ever saw me again. Cousins I grew up with were sharing screenshots of our old photos with comments like, can't believe I trusted this creep. I waited every single day for police to show up with handcuffs. Every knock on my door made my heart stop. Every unknown phone number sent me into panic attacks, thinking it was detectives or lawyers. I lost everything, piece by piece. My job, At the auto shop because I couldn't focus. Kept making stupid mistakes, showing up late, calling in sick. My boss, Mike, finally sat me down after three months and said whatever was happening at home needed to stay there. But I was too broken to explain. Lost my apartment four months later when I couldn't make rent. Moved in with my buddy Jay Jake, who let me crash on his couch. But even Jake started asking weird questions when family never visited or called. Dude, where's your family? It's been six months and I've never seen a single relative. I made up lies about them living far away, being busy, having drama. Dating became impossible. How do you explain why your entire family disowned you? First girl I tried seeing asked to meet my parents after two months. I panicked and told her they passed in a car accident. She was so sympathetic it made me sick. Second girl saw through everything. When she noticed I had zero family photos in my apartment, no one to invite to anything. She asked Point Blank why I never talked about my family. When I couldn't give her a straight answer, she was gone by morning. Holidays destroyed me completely. Everyone else had somewhere to go, someone to call, someone who cared they existed. I drive past my old neighborhood and see all the cars in my parents driveway. Knowing they were all inside laughing and eating together without me. I finally moved 3 States away to Colorado and started completely over. New job at a different auto shop, new apartment, new friends who knew nothing about my past. For years, I lived like I had no family. Like I just appeared out of nowhere as an adult. Never dated seriously, because I couldn't risk anyone digging too deep into my background. Built walls so high, I forgot what it felt like to trust.

I slammed on the brakes and jumped out of my car. Nora, baby, what are you doing out here? She was shivering violently. And just her school clothes, no coat. Tears frozen on her little cheeks. Daddy locked me out. He said, I can't come back until you get home from work. My heart dropped. It was 9 p m. On a Friday. Jonathan knew I always worked late on Fridays. This wasn't an accident. How long have you been out here? Since you left this morning, she whispered. I scooped her up, feeling how ice cold her little body was, and carried her toward our front door. It was locked. I used my key. Fury building with every step. I found Jonathan exactly where I expected. Sprawled on the couch in his boxers and T-shirt, controller in hand, playing call of duty. The heat was cranked up to 75 degrees. Empty beer cans littered the coffee table. Why was our daughter outside for 12 hours? I tried to keep my voice calm. He didn't even pause his game. She spilled grape juice on my new controller this morning, I told her. Actions have consequences. I stared at him in disbelief. She's 6 years old, Jonathan. She spilled juice accidentally and you left her outside to freeze? Maybe next time she'll be more careful around my stuff. That's when I noticed Nora's pink backpack sitting by the front door. It was stuffed full, bulging at the seams. Her favorite stuffed bunny was sticking out the top. What's this? I pointed at the bag. Jonathan finally paused his game and turned to look at me. There was something cold in his eyes I'd never or seen before. I've been doing a lot of thinking today. While she was outside, he said slowly, this whole family thing isn't working out for me. Nor is too much work, too expensive, too loud. And honestly, I never wanted kids in the first place. The room started spinning. What are you talking about? I'm talking about you taking her and leaving tonight. I already had the locks changed while you were at work. You just got lucky I hadn't switched them out yet. I felt like I was in a nightmare. You're abandoning your own daughter? Nora was still clinging to me, her wet clothes soaking through my work blazer. She was listening to every word, her big brown eyes darting between us. Here's the thing. Jonathan stood up straight like this was all perfectly normal. She's not really mine anyway. I mean, yeah, biologically, whatever. But I never signed up for this dad life. You can have her. The casual cruelty in his voice made me sick. This was the man I've been married to for eight years. The man who used to read Nora bedtime stories. Jonathan, she's your daughter. You can't just watch Me. He picked up his phone. I already talked to my buddy Steven, who's a lawyer. Apparently, if I just voluntarily give up my parental rights, I don't have to pay child support either. Win, win. My hands started shaking, but not from fear. From rage. I pulled out my phone and speed dialled a number I'd hoped I'd never have to use. Hi, Christine, it's Caroline. Remember that emergency custody documentation we discussed months ago? File everything. Tonight. Jonathan's controller slipped from his hands. What are you doing? What you should have expected when you decided to mess with my daughter. I hit another number. Dad, it's happening.

Now they want me to fund their retirement. So my parents had been saving money for all three of us kids to go to college since we were babies. My older brother and sister both used theirs, went to the local state school, lived at home, worked part time jobs at target, in the mall for spending money. I'm the youngest, and I was different. While they were partying in high school, I was grinding. 4.0 GPA, valedictorian, captain of the debate team, studying every single night because I had bigger dreams than staying local. Senior year, I got a full ride scholarship to one of the top engineering programs in the country. Full tuition, room and board, everything covered. When I asked my parents if I could use my college fund for other stuff, maybe a car or to help with living expenses, they called a family meeting. They sat me down at the kitchen table with this whole serious lecture. The money was specifically saved for education expenses. Since your scholarship covers everything and you don't actually need it, we're not legally obligated to give it to you. It wouldn't be fair to your brother and sister who had to work part time jobs during school. I tried explaining that I'd worked way harder than either of them, that I'd sacrificed my entire social life, that I was saving them literally tens of thousands of dollars they'd plan to spend. My dad Just shook his head and said, that's not how this works. Two months later, they used my college money, the money they've been telling me was mine my whole life, to completely renovate their kitchen and take the whole family to Disney World. When I said I wouldn't be joining them on the vacation, my mom said I was being ungrateful and dramatic. Fine. The day after graduation, I moved out. My uncle got me a job as a welder's helper on a pipeline crew. These were hardcore blue collar guys making serious money in brutal auditions. They all thought I was insane to give up that kind of cash to go sit in classrooms. But I showed up every day at 5:00am, worked in 100 degree heat, got my hands destroyed, came home exhausted. The welder I was paired with actually gave me a two thousand dollar bonus at the end of summer because he'd expect I did me to quit after three days. But I stuck it out. Did that same routine for three summers straight. School year, perfect grades, great professors, amazing friends. Summer back with the pipeline crew, banking every dollar while my siblings were doing internships at coffee shops. I was making more than most adults. Got a co op position my senior year that LED to a job offer. Graduated with zero debt. Started traveling the world for work. Been doing it for 10 years now. No wife, no kids. Just building my career. And saving money like crazy. Then last month, I get this call from my dad. Hey, buddy. Your mom and I are thinking about retiring early. We know you're doing really well financially, and we were hoping you could help us out a little bit. I asked how much my brother and sister were contributing to their retirement fund. Long pause. Well, you know, they both have families now. Kids are expensive. They really can't afford to help out right now. I couldn't help but smile. Dad. That's

I smiled. Like the movie with Katniss Everdeen? No, silly. It's when we see who cries first from being hungry. I never lose anymore, but Millie still does. Her little sister, maybe five, was sitting in the corner, clutching her stomach. How long do you play play this game? I asked, keeping my voice light. My record is three days. Ava beamed with pride. Daddy marks it on the fridge chart. Millie only made it one day before she cried like a baby. My assistant, Jackie, shot me a glance. That's when I noticed how Ava's dress hung loose on her frame. That's impressive, I said, trying to keep my voice steady. Do you play this game a lot? Every week. Sometimes twice. If we've been bad, like when I forgot to clean my room, I had to play for four days. Four days is a really long time without food, I said, watching her stuff crackers in her pockets. What happens when someone loses? We have to wait longer. Daddy says only we kids need food every day. Millie whimpered from her corner. My tummy hurts all the time. Ava whipped around. Shut up! What's wrong with you? You'll lose. Do you want to wait another week? My hands stilled on the book I was preparing to read. That seems like a long time for the game. Not really. Theo Went nine days once, but then he fainted at school. The nurse got all weird about it. Now he's not allowed to play anymore. She said it was pity for Theo. Theo's your brother? Foster brother. He went to live somewhere else. Daddy said he was too weak for our family. Ava, when did you eat last? I asked casually, like we were discussing the weather. She counted on her fingers. Tuesday. Daddy says I'm getting stronger. It was Saturday. This child hadn't eaten in four days and was out of it. I noticed Millie's hair was thin, patchy in places. Her arms looked like twigs. And what about breakfast or snacks? I prompted gently. Oh, no, that's cheating. When we play The Hunger Game, it's nothing at all. Not even milk. Water is okay, though. Daddy's not mean. The way she said it, like allowing water made him generous, sent ice through my veins. Well, it's story time. Everyone eats, I said firmly, pushing the entire snack tray toward them. Different rules here. While the other children arrived, I watched Ava carefully portion out food to her sister, whispering, eat slow so you don't throw up. My stomach turned. They've done this before. Ava, I said quietly, during snack time, does your mommy play the Hunger Game, too? Sometimes, but she cheats. I caught her eating crackers in the bathroom once. Daddy made her play for a whole week after that. She kept crying and saying she was sorry. But rules are rules. I excused myself to get more supplies and called CPS for my office. I have two children here showing clear signs of systematic starvation, I whispered urgently. The older one hasn't eaten in four days and thinks it's a game. Back in the story room, I sat close to the girls during reading time. Ava leaned against me and I could feel her ribs through her dress. Do you play other games at home? I asked. During craft time, the strong game, Millie piped up. We stand with our arms up until someone drops them. Ava nodded. I lasted two hours yesterday. Daddy says we're building character. She showed me the underside of her arms. Bruises lined them where blood had pooled. Sometimes we play the quiet game in the cold shower. If you make noise, you stay.

I smiled. Like the movie with Katniss Everdeen? No, silly. It's when we see who cries first from being hungry. I never lose anymore, but Millie still does. Her little sister, maybe five, was sitting in the corner clutching her stomach. How long do you play this game? I asked, keeping my voice light. My record is three days. Ava beamed with pride. Daddy marks it on the fridge chart. Millie only made it one day before she cried like a baby. My assistant, Jackie, shot me a glance. That's when I noticed how Ava's dress hung loose on her frame. That's impressive, I said, trying to keep my voice steady. Do you play this game a lot? Every week. Sometimes twice. If we've been bad, like when I forgot to clean my room, I had to play for four days. Four days is a really long time without food, I said, watching her stuff crackers in her pockets. What happens when someone loses? They have to wait longer. Daddy says only we kids need food every day. Millie whimpered from her corner. My tummy hurts all the time. Ava whipped around. Shut up! What's wrong with you? You'll lose points. Do you want to wait another week? My hands stilled on the book I was preparing to read. That seems like a long time for the game. Not really. Theo went nine days once, but then he fainted at school and the nurse got all weird about it. Now he's not allowed to play anymore. She said it was pity for Theo. Theo's your brother? Foster brother. He went to live somewhere else. Daddy said he was too weak for our family. Ava, when did you eat last? I asked casually, like we were discussing the weather. She counted on her fingers. Tuesday. Daddy says I'm getting stronger. It was Saturday. This child hadn't eaten in four days and was proud of it. I know what is. Millie's hair was thin, patchy in places. Her arms looked like twigs. And what about breakfast or snacks? I prompted gently. Oh, no, that's cheating. When we play The Hunger Game, it's nothing at all. Not even milk. Water is okay, though. Daddy's not mean. The way she said it, like allowing water made him generous, sent ice through my veins. Well, it's story time. Everyone eats, I said firmly, pushing the entire snack tray toward them. Different rules here. While the other children arrived, I watched Ava carefully portion out food to her sister, whispering, eat slow so you don't throw up. My stomach turned. They've done this before. Ava, I said quietly, during snack time, does your mommy play the Hunger Game, too? Sometimes, but she cheats. I caught her eating crackers in the bathroom once. Daddy made her play for a whole week after that. She kept crying and Saying she was sorry, but rules are rules, I excused myself to get more supplies and called CPS for my office. I have two children here showing clear signs of systematic starvation, I whispered urgently. The older one hasn't eaten in four days and thinks it's a game. Back in the story room, I sat close to the girls during reading time. Ava leaned against me and I could feel her ribs through her dress. Do you play other games at home? I asked. During craft time, the strong game, Millie piped up. We stand with our arms up until someone drops them. Ava nodded. I lasted two hours yesterday. Daddy says we're building character. She showed me the underside of her arms. Bruises lined them where blood had pulled. Sometimes we play the quiet game.

When the doctor told me surgery or death, and my boyfriend drew told me to start digging my own grave. However, he'd soon come to regret it. I was sitting in the office after finally going in for the stomach pain I've been ignoring for months. This could have been prevented if caught earlier, he said, looking at my chart. When was your last checkup? Four years ago. I couldn't afford it. I have insurance, but I needed every penny for rent, bills, my boyfriend's art studio. The doctor frowned, tapping on a clipboard. I see. Well, the surgery will cost about $5,000 with your coverage. 5,000? I felt the air get knocked out from my lungs. Maybe next time, doctor. I can still handle it. He gave a worried look before signing the release papers. But three steps from the hospital door, I felt a sharp pain zapped through me. I dropped to my knees on the asphalt and coughed up blood. The security guard radioed for help, and they rushed me back on a stretcher. You're bleeding internally. If we don't operate soon, this could rupture. I frowned and gave them Drew's contact. Think he'd understand? Just this once? The nurse stayed with me while they prepped more paperwork. So you handle all the bills? She asked with a disgusted expression, after I'd explained our situation. Well, when drew makes it big, it'll All come back like an investment. The nurse couldn't help but roll her eyes at my answer. And how long has he been not making it big? Six years. And how many of these artworks has he sold? Nothing yet, but he's close to a breakthrough. His mentor says he has talent, but I think this time I might have overdone it. I work 60 hours a week, two jobs. I haven't bought new clothes in three years. I'd love to go to a salon one last time before, you know, I pass away, I said bleakly, laughing at my own terrible situation. You need to take care of yourself too, honey. She touched my hand gently. What does your partner contribute exactly? I opened my mouth and closed it. He contributes. He's following his passion. I'd like to show him my passion. My passionate fists, she mumbled to herself and smiled. All right, you rest up. She left the room, still clearly upset at my story, but it felt nice having someone worry about me for once. Drew arrived two hours later, looking annoyed. This is really bad timing. I have a studio session with my mentor. The doctor explained the situation again. The urgency, the cost. Drew's face lit up. Actually, this is perfect timing. What? I asked, shocked at his happy tone. We have exactly 5,000 saved, right? Well, my mentor knows a gallery owner, and I can finally book my first show. I stared at him. From the hospital bed. But that money is for my surgery. Yeah, but we could get a loan for that, right? This is my one shot, drew. I'm dying. He looked at me with a raised eyebrow and an expression that screamed, so what? I snapped. No, I said calmly. What do you mean, no? The heart monitor slowly started rising. Six years, drew. I've paid for your life for six years. And now when I plan on choosing myself for once, you tell me not to. But it's not just a gallery. It's my dream. I tried to fight back my tears, but couldn't hold them. Your dream over my life. All this time, I've just been some sponsor to your dream. An open bank account. As working 60 hours is easy. It's not. I'm tired. So tired, drew. I said I'd pay it all back. He yelled. I laughed. When? Well, when? My art gallery. If you had to choose now, what would it be? My surgery or your gallery? Drew stood there with his mouth gaping open, acting as if it was a difficult question. I can't believe you're making me choose. That's, um, gaslighting. Choose. Drew paced back and forth nervously. This isn't fair. My mentor said this gallery could really change everything for me. Uh, for us. I said, choose. I'll come check on you after my show. He took my wallet from my back and walked out. I sobbed.

Three years ago, when I first met my husband, Greg's mother, Mallory, she made her famous tuna casserole with crushed potato chips and mayonnaise that had definitely seen better days. The smell alone made my stomach turn. But she stood there watching me take that first bite with such hopeful eyes. I couldn't crush her heart like that. So I smiled, forced it down, and said it was delicious. That single moment of kindness became my prison. Now, three years into our marriage, edge, Mallory brings food over twice a week, always in those same vintage Tupperware containers she's had since the 70s. When she brings her surprise meatloaf that tastes like cardboard soaked in ketchup, I order meatloaf from the diner and carefully transfer it to her containers. I'm spending $200 a month just to maintain the charade. Things started unraveling two weeks ago when Mallory announced she was entering a cooking competition at the community center and wanted me to be her sous chef and taste tester. She's been coming over more frequently, sometimes unannounced, bringing practice dishes. Greg's been acting strange about it, too. Overly enthusiastic, constantly asking if I'm excited about spending more. I'm with his mother, watching me eat with this weird intensity. His eyes literally track every bite from fork to mouth, and he keeps asking, isn't it amazing? Don't you wish you could have this every day? My stomach Turns every time. Yesterday, he came home early and almost caught me transferring Thai food into Mallory's green bean casserole dish. I had to pretend I was just freshening up the presentation. My hands were shaking so badly, I nearly dropped the whole thing. He stood there for a full minute, just staring at me with a strange smile before saying, you really do love her cooking, don't you? But here's what's really odd. Greg's been having hushed phone conversations that end abruptly when I enter the room. Last week, I heard him say something about measuring the guest room and February move in date. When I asked about it, he said he was helping a coworker with furniture dimensions. He's also been weirdly insistent about us decluttering the spare bedroom, saying we need to make space. It's for new possibilities. Yesterday I found him in there with a tape measure and a notebook sketching what looked like furniture placement. When I walked in, he slammed the notebook shut and practically shoved me out, saying it was a surprise and I'd ruin everything if I kept snooping. Mallory's been dropping hints, too, asking about local doctors, the nearest grocery stores, whether our street gets loud quickly in winter. But if I ever tried to ask more questions, he'd shut me down instantly. Then one day, I woke up with food poisoning from this sketchy replacement Chinese food I had the day before and ran to the bathroom through the window. I saw Greg in the backyard on the phone, and his voice carry clearly in the morning. Quiet. Mom, I know you're excited about surprising her, but maybe we should tell her before my blood went cold. Tell me about what? He continued. I know I said February, but if you win this competition, it would be the perfect Celebration to announce your moving in. She loves your cooking so much. She'll be thrilled to have you here full time. Wait, moving in was my mother in law moving in, and my husband was just letting it happen? I stayed frozen, listening to him reassure his mother that I would definitely want her living with us, that I'm always saying how much I miss her between visits. The competition is tomorrow, and Mallory texted that she's bring

My coworker slides me $200 cash during lunch and whispers, I need you to be my boyfriend tomorrow. Just for four hours. It's my cousin's wedding. I almost choked on my sandwich. She's never talked to me about anything beyond spreadsheets and deadline complaints. Now she's offering me money to fake date her? She explains fast. Look, my whole family keeps asking why I'm still single. My mom calls every Sunday to remind me I'm 32 with no prospects. I just need someone normal to shut them up. Plus, you have that one good suit. The wedding's tomorrow at 2 p m. She promises another 200 after. You just have to hold my hand, laugh at my dad's jokes, and don't get too drunk. Easy money. Four hours of free food and pretending to like someone I already think is pretty cool. The cash would cover my car payment. Sure, why not? She looks relieved, like she was expecting me to say no, thank you. Seriously, you're saving my life here. Saturday morning, she picks me up in a BMW I didn't know she had. She's nervous, talking fast about the rules. We've been dating three months, met at work. That part's true. You love hiking. Because my mom will love that you went to State University. Don't mention your ex. Actually, don't mention any ex at all. She's gripping the steering wheel so tight, her knuckles Are white. Something's bothering her beyond normal. Fake date nerves. The venue is fancy. Way fancier than I expected. Valet parking, ice sculptures, a string quartet playing by the entrance. This isn't some backyard wedding. This is money. She grabs my hand really tight as we walk in, her palms sweating. Just stick close to me, okay? Some people here are complicated. We enter the cocktail area, and my chest tightens. I recognize faces in the crowd. This one guy by the bar is one of my ex's best friends, who always hosted those poker nights. This other guy is talking to someone near the fountain. He's my ex's friend from college who's always tagged with her in beach photos. Made me jealous every time. Then this girl walks by in a bridesmaid dress. She was my ex's roommate senior year. The one who told her I wasn't good enough. My stomach drops. These aren't random people. This is my ex's entire friend circle. Circle? Every person who watched our relationship explode. Hey, whose wedding is this exactly? I ask. She pulls me forward. My cousin Taylor's. Come on. Ceremony starting. Taylor. My ex's name is Taylor. We sit down in the fourth row. I'm scanning in the crowd, recognizing more faces. People who unfriended me after the breakup. I'm sweating through my good suit. Then the music starts. The wedding march. Everyone stands. The bride walks out. It's her. My ex. When I found in our bed with someone Else, two years ago. The one I was going to propose to. She's wearing the kind of dress she used to show me in magazines. My coworker squeezes my hand. You okay? You look pale. I can't speak. Can't move, can't breathe. Taylor looks beautiful, happy, glowing in a way she never did with me. The grooms, tall, everything. I'm not. After the ceremony, we're at cocktail hour. I'm Downing champagne like water, trying to stay calm. My coworker stays glued to my side, introducing me to aunts and uncles. This is my boyfriend. Three months now. He's wonderful playing the part, but dying inside. Then Taylor appears with the groom. Oh, my god, is that you? My coworker jumps in fast. Babe, you know the bride? Taylor's face cycles through emotions. Shock, confusion, something else. We. We dated years ago. Small world, my coworker says. Way too cheerful. We should get drinks sometime.

During a dinner celebrating us signing a lease on a brand new home, my wife dropped the bomb that she was quitting her job. I want to be a trad wife, she said out of the blue. I thought it was a joke until she pulled up her Instagram, where she had already made an extensive post about how amazing of a husband I was for agreeing to work two jobs to pay for the mortgage. The next morning, Katie quit her nursing job with no notice. By the end of the week, she'd gone full traditional. Wouldn't drive, wouldn't work, wouldn't make financial decisions. She also wouldn't answer the door for deliveries, claiming that was a man's job. So my expensive work equipment got stolen off our porch. she refused to sign for my certified mail from the IRS about a tax because traditional wives don't handle business matters. I got fined $8,000 for missing the deadline. Then my brother got into a severe car accident 40 minutes away. Single dad. His kids were at school and needed to be picked up. In two hours, he was unconscious and I was stuck in a mandatory meeting at work that I'd be fired for leaving. Katie, please, just this once, pick up the kids from school and drive them to the hospital. Traditional wives don't drive, she said, arranging flowers she picked from our garden. It's not feminine. They're 8 and 10 years old. They'll be standing outside school alone. Maybe their mother should have thought about that before divorcing your brother. My brother's kids waited outside their school until child services pick them up. The investigation lasted months. He nearly lost custody because of child abandonment while he was literally in a coma. I remember begging her to stop. She could be traditional and still use her frontal lobe, but nope, because two weeks later, our house caught fire. She was in the kitchen and left the stove on by accident. Extinguisher was literally in the corner next to her. But instead of grabbing it, she ran outside and called me. Traditional wives don't handle emergencies. That's the man's job. By the time firefighters arrived, half the kitchen was destroyed. 20,000 in damages. Insurance investigated why she didn't attempt to put out a containable fire, and our premiums tripled. That was when I finally snapped. You want traditional? Fine. She gleamed with excitement until I opened our banking app. I'm closing your access to our joint account. Her head snapped up. What? Traditional wives don't have their own bank accounts. They get allowances. My grandfather gave my grandmother $10 a week in 1960. Adjusted for inflation, that's $100 a month. That's insane. That's traditional. That evening, she was planning a Friday night out with the girls. Apparently, that's traditional. I'll need an Uber to downtown. Probably $30 each way. Traditional wives don't go to Bars without their husbands? That's inappropriate. It's just drinks with friends. My grandmother never went anywhere without my grandfather after six PM. Very traditional. She ended up canceling. Her father's 70th birthday was the next week, and her whole family had planned a surprise party for months. But when Saturday came, I had to work. I can't take you. I said, so you can't go. She had no car and missed it. Her father cried when he realized she wasn't coming. Her mother called her selfish. When Katie's grandmother was dying in hospice, Katie came to me crying, please, I need money for an Uber. Just this once. She's asking for me. Traditional wives don't handle money. I reminded her you said modern women's financial independence destroyed marriages. Remember your Instagram post? Her grandmother died a 30 minute drive away while Katie sat at home. Then her brother's wedding invitation arrived. Destination wedding in Mexico. Katie begged for her

I came into the emergency room clutching my abdomen. In the same hospital I once worked as chief of surgery. After two hours, I finally got to see Doctor Harm, who barely glanced up at me and sighed like I'd interrupted something by being here. Let me guess, he said before I could speak. You're 90 years old, ate dinner too late, and now you're panicking. On a scale of one to 10, how bad is your imaginary emergency? When I said eight, he actually laughed. Right. Everyone says eight. Real pain doesn't let you walk in here in your pajamas looking so put together. My pajamas were soaked with sweat from the pain. When did you last have your period? He asked with a smirk. When I said I was postmenopausal, he nodded like he'd solved everything. There you go. Hormones. They make women your age think every little cramp is a heart attack or appendicitis. You tried yoga? Maybe losing some weight? He typed something without examining me. I see a lot of hysterical women your age. Retirement gives you too much time to obsess over every little ache. I tried to explain that I knew my body, but he interrupted, ma'am, I have actual emergencies to deal with. Young man next door got stabbed. That's real medicine. Your psychosomatic belly ache can be handled by your GP on Monday. He started to leave, but I grabbed the rails of The bed, please. Something's wrong. I can feel it. He pried my fingers off one by one. This is drug seeking behavior. Are you here for pain pills? Because that's not happening. A nurse came in and harm told her loudly. Just anxiety. Probably wants attention. Her husband probably doesn't listen to her anymore, so she comes here for someone to talk to. He didn't know. My husband died two years ago in this very hospital. Don't waste resources on blood work. Give her some antacids and discharge papers. The nurse looked uncertain, but he snapped. Did I stutter, or do you want to be a doctor now, too? When I asked for a different doctor, he got nastier. You want a doctor shop? Classic drug seeking. I'm noting this in your file. He pulled up my chart on the computer. Oh, look, you've been here before. Frequent flyer. Lonely old women love the attention from young doctors. It's pathetic, but common. He didn't scroll down far enough to see my employment history at this hospital. The pain was getting worse and I doubled over, which made him roll his eyes dramatically. The performance isn't necessary. I've seen better acting from kindergarteners. He called another resident over. Watch this. Classic case of Munchausen's in the elderly. They Google symptoms and then pretend to have them. The president looked uncomfortable but stayed quiet. She probably lives alone. Kids don't visit, so she creates drama. I started describing my symptoms in medical Terms, hoping it would help. The pain is intermittent, positional with guarding in the upper quadrant. He cut me off. Oh, great. You watch Grey's anatomy and think you're a doctor now? Let me guess, you diagnose yourself on Webmd. He turned to the nurse. She's using medical words she doesn't understand. Probably reads medical forums all day. These board housewives always think they have whatever disease is trending on Facebook. When I stood up to leave and find another hospital, I collapsed from the pain. Instead of helping, he stood over me and said, this manipulation won't work. Get up. You're taking a bed from someone who actually needs it. He didn't help me up, just watched as I struggled. In my professional opinion, you need a psychiatrist, not an ER. Maybe some friends, hobby, anything besides wasting our time. He grabbed my arm roughly to pull me up, and I cried out, stop the theatrics! I'm documenting this as a psych case. You'll be lucky if insurance covers this visit when I'm done. He started dictating to his phone. Patient presents with fabricated symptoms, drug seeking behavior and hysteria typical of menopausal women seeking attention. He looked at me with disgust. Women like

My cousin Brianna sent out the most insane wedding invitation I've ever seen. Under the dress code, in bold letters, it said, no female guests. This includes family members, plus ones, and children. Male attendees only. I thought it was a typo until she called me personally. I know it seems harsh, she said, but I need my wedding day to be about me. Other women always steal attention. This is my solution. I tried reasoning with her. Brianna, your own mother can't come to your wedding. She'll understand. Besides, she always cries and makes everything about her emotions. Real reason came out after 20 minutes of talking. Brianna was convinced that her fiance, Jerome, would leave her for someone prettier. She'd caught him liking other women's photos online and decided the only solution was to eliminate all competition from her big day. The family was in uproar. Her mother sobbed for days. Her three sisters were devastated. Even Jerome's mother was banned. But Brianna wouldn't budge. She hired all male vendors. Male photographer, male caterers, male florist. She even found a male makeup artist to do her hair and makeup. Two weeks before the wedding, I got a call from Jerome's best man, Terrell. This is insane. He's. Jerome's trying to support her, but his mom is threatening to disown him. Can't you talk sense into her? I tried one more time. Brianna just said, either support my Decision or don't come to the reception. Yes, she was allowing women at the reception, just not the ceremony, because that made sense in her world. The day of the wedding arrived. I wasn't there, obviously, but Terrell live streamed it for the banned women in a group chat. The venue looked beautiful, but eerily empty. Thirty men sat awkwardly in a space meant for 200. No one knew where to look or what to say. Then came the professional. Brianna had no bridesmaids, so she walked alone. The music started, the doors opened, and in walked nobody. The music played for a full minute while everyone stared at the empty doorway. Jerome started sweating. The efficient looked confused. Terrell ran to check. He found Brianna in the bridal suite, locked in the bathroom, having a complete meltdown. Her male makeup artist had given her what she called drag queen makeup. Her hair was teased into a massive Buffon. She looked like she was competing in a pageant from 1987 without any women around to help fix it. She'd been trying to redo everything herself and made it worse. But that wasn't why she was really crying. Through the door. She admitted the truth. I've been so focused on keeping women away that I forgot this meant I'd have nobody to share this with. No mother daughter moment, no sisters helping with my dress. I'm completely alone on the most important day of my life. Jerome went to talk To her, we could hear him through Terrell's phone. Baby, this. It's crazy. You banned my mother? Your mother? What are we doing? I just didn't want you looking at other women, she sobbed. I'm looking at other women every day because you made this wedding into a circus! Everyone's talking about the bride who banned women, not the bride I'm marrying. You created the exact attention you were trying to avoid. She finally came out an hour later, makeup streaked, hair deflated. They did a quick ceremony with just the officiant, Jerome Terrell, and Brianna's father, who looked like he wanted to disappear here. The reception was even worse. All the band women showed up, but the atmosphere was ice cold. Brianna tried to act like nothing happened, but everyone knew. Her mother sat in the corner crying. Her sisters left after 15 minutes. Jerome's mother didn't even show up. The photographer, who'd only been hired for his gender, turned out to be terrible. Every photo was

We've been together two years. Last month, his college girlfriend Madison died from cancer at just 26. They'd broken up five years ago, but stayed friends on social media. I'd always felt a little weird about their friendship, but I trusted him completely. He was absolutely devastated when she passed. Took a week off work, barely ate anything. Just lay in bed scrolling through old photos of them together. I tried being supportive, making his favorite meals, bringing him tea, giving him space when he needed it. Then he started talking about her constantly. Madison always made the best lasagna from scratch with her grandmother's recipe. Madison would have absolutely loved this movie. She had such incredible taste in everything. Madison understood my twisted sense of humor better than anyone ever has or probably ever will. At first I thought it was completely normal grief. People reminisce about lost friends all the time, right? I figured he'd work through it naturally, but it escalated really quickly. He began comparing literally everything I did to Madison. When I cooked dinner, he'd mention how Madison's version was somehow better. When I laughed at his jokes, he'd say Madison's laugh was more genuine and musical. When I wore certain outfits, he comment that Madison had better style sense. It got really weird when he asked me to dye my hair blonde like Madison's had been. Said it would help him feel closer to those happy memories during this in readily difficult time in his life. I refused Point Blank. He got genuinely upset, accused me of being selfish and unsupportive during his grief. Said a truly loving girlfriend would understand what he was going through and try to help him heal properly. That hurt deeply, but I tried to stay patient. Everyone grieves differently, and I didn't want to be the terrible girlfriend who couldn't handle her boyfriend mourning a friend. Last week, I found him at two a m. Sitting at our kitchen table, writing intensely in a leather journal I'd never seen before, page after page about Madison. How she was his true soulmate and the only woman who truly understood his deepest soul. He wrote things like, I made the biggest mistake of my life letting her go, and I settled for someone lesser because I was terrified of real, assuming love. I was reading over his shoulder in the dark hallway when he finally noticed me standing there. He slammed the journal shut and got incredibly defensive. Said it was private therapy and I was serious, seriously violating his personal boundaries. The absolute final straw was yesterday evening. We're at dinner with his parents at their favorite Italian restaurant, when his mom casually mentions that Madison had sent her a lasagna recipe years ago. He immediately tears up and says, I'll never love anyone the way I loved her. She was absolutely Perfect in every single way imaginable. His dad looked completely horrified. His mom tried desperately changing the subject to the web.

And now that I'm rich, he demands that I give him our house and support him for the rest of his life. I was 15 when my parents died. No family ended up on the streets until a government program gave me housing and half minimum wage until 18. When that ended, I couldn't get work because I had no address. Finally got a job at a diner making almost nothing. That's where I met Cody, my now husband. He was a regular customer and we talked for hours. Six months later, I moved in with him. His dad hated me from day one. Called me worthless, said I'd drag his son down. I paid their rent, bills, groceries. Saved every penny for our future. Didn't matter. Daily insults, constant judgment. Street rat. He'd call me at dinner. My son deserves better than some homeless girl. Cody would defend me, but his dad would just laugh. She's using you, son. Mark my words. I worked doubles at the diner while Cody did construction. Every night I'd come home exhausted to more criticism. Still smell like grease. His dad would sneer, this is what failure looks like. The worst part? I genuinely tried to win him over. Cooked his favorite meals, cleaned the house spotless. Even bought him birthday gifts with money I could barely spare. Nothing worked. One Christmas. I saved for months to buy him a nice watch. He opened it, looked gusted, and said, I don't need charity from a charity case. Then he threw it in the trash right in front of me. Cody's friends would come over, and his dad would introduce me as the homeless girl Cody's wasting his time with. I'd sit there humiliated while everyone looked at me with pity. One night, we came home from a date, and he wouldn't let us in. Said he'd sold our clothes and stolen our savings. I won't support two losers who'll never succeed. We slept in my car that night. Cody cried. First time I'd ever seen him break down. I'm sorry, he kept saying. I should have stood up to him sooner. Got a tiny room near the diner. Cody found work. The room was so small, we had to take turns getting dressed. Ate a ramen for months, but we were finally free. We took a loan, opened our own small restaurant. After hours, Cody would cook while I waited tables. We'd work our day jobs, then run to our place until midnight. The first year was brutal. Barely breaking even, working 16 hour days, sleeping four hours a night. His dad would drive by sometimes just to laugh at us through the window. But slowly, customers started coming back. Word spread. Local food blogger gave us five stars. Lines started forming outside. We hired our first employee, a kid from The streets like me. Then another. Cody insisted we pay above minimum wage. Everyone deserves a real chance, he'd say. Years passed. That one restaurant became five, then 10. We built an empire. Cody proposed in our flagship restaurant. You turn my life around, he said. Let's make it official. His dad wasn't invited to the wedding. We had two kids, Sophia and Frederick. Cody turned into the most incredible father. I want to be everything my dad wasn't, he'd say while reading them bedtime stories. Our company went public three years ago. We're worth about 50 million now. Bought a mansion in the hills with a pool the kids love. Cody's mom visits sometimes. Divorced his dad years ago and finally admits he was always horrible.

But I went along with it and watched her and her lawyer embarrass themselves in front of the judge. We split custody fifty fifty when we divorced 3 years ago. Same salaries, same time with our 5 year old daughter, so no child support needed. That was the deal we both signed off on. But my ex got greedy. She quit her job to find herself enrolled in some online marketing course, then dropped out after two months when it got hard. Suddenly she's blowing up my phone demanding $200 monthly because I control my finances better than her. I laughed it off until her lawyer contacted me. Fine. I thought, let's play this game. Here's what she didn't know. I'm meticulous with records. Every receipt, every bank statement, every expense tracked to the penny. And color coded bed sheets. It's literally how I survived our messy divorce. Her lawyer filed the case without requesting my actual income. They just guessed based on my old job from two years ago and guessed wrong. They estimated I made 30% more than reality and had half my actual expenses. Basic mistake number one. Meanwhile, I'm gathering evidence like I'm building a criminal case. Stubs, rent receipts, grocery bills, medical co pays, our daughter's dance class fees, everything organized by date and category. As we approached court, my lawyer called with an update. Her attorney figured out She'd been lying about her financial situation and wanted to settle immediately. She doesn't want to go to court anymore, he said, barely containing his laughter. But my ex refused the settlement. She was convinced she'd win because judges always side with the mom. Court day arrives. Sitting there in my best suit, folder full of evidence, watching her strut in like she owns the place. The judge reviews both our financial statements side by side. I watch his expression change from neutral to confused to visibly annoyed. Plot twist after calculating everything properly, she actually had more disposable income than me. Way more. Her unemployment benefits, plus child tax credits, plus help from her new boyfriend, plus the side gig she forgot to mention. It all added up. The judge looked directly at her. Ma'am, you're asking him to pay support when you have $400 more per month than available income? Her lawyer literally face palmed and started shuffling papers like he was looking for an escape route. But it gets exponentially better. She'd submitted completely falsified bank statements as supporting evidence, claiming she only had $75 in total savings. The judge caught the deception immediately. Dates didn't match the statement periods, dollar amounts were clearly altered with correction fluid. The bank routing numbers were from a completely different financial institution. Ma'am, are you fully aware that knowingly submitting false evidence to this court constitutes perjury, which is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison? The Judge asked, his voice absolutely ice cold. My ex Heather went completely pale and start

So I got the perfect revenge. She crashed our cabin weekend claiming her Airbnb fell through. I knew it was BS the moment she showed up with a perfectly packed bag and a smug smile. My boyfriend Joseph felt bad for her and invited her to stay without even asking me. For three days straight, she kept creating these elaborate situations to make me look like the worst girlfriend ever. Like when she helped make dinner on Friday night. She volunteered to preheat the oven while I prepped ingredients. Everything seemed normal until I put our carefully marinated steaks in and they came out completely charred. She acted shocked when Joseph got mad at me for ruining our expensive dinner. Later, I noticed she'd secretly cranked the oven to 500 degrees. Saturday morning, she suggested we go hiking to this amazing waterfall she'd been to for. She gave me detailed directions to the trailhead while she rode with Joseph. Turns out she sent me to the wrong trail entirely. I spent two hours lost in the woods with no cell service while they bonded over waiting for me. When I finally found them at the actual trailhead, Joseph was visibly annoyed I'd kept them waiting. She just shrugged and said, oh, I guess I mixed up the directions. My bad. The manipulation got worse as the weekend went on. She kept doing this thing where she'd bring up inside jokes and memories from before I existed, making me. I feel like an outsider in my own relationship. Remember when we did this? And remember when we did that? Always with this little smile directed at me. She'd also accidentally brush against Joseph, constantly grab his arm when laughing, and find excuses to lean over him. During Saturday afternoon, we decided to go swimming in the lake. She conveniently forgot to pack a swimsuit and asked to borrow one of mine. The one she picked was my smallest bikini, and she made sure to comment loudly about how loose it was on her while adjusting it right in front of Joseph. Then she suggested we play volleyball in the water and kept accidentally bumping into me, making me lose my balance. The breaking point was Saturday night, we were all sitting by the fire when she pretended to be drunk and started crying about how much she missed the old days before I came along and changed everything. She was literally sobbing into Joseph's shoulder about how their friend group was never the same, how she felt like she was losing her best friend, and how things used to be so much. My boyfriend was actually comforting her, rubbing her back, and telling her nothing had changed between them. That's when I noticed something crucial. All weekend, she'd been taking tons of photos with Joseph's phone and hers, documenting every Moment. But I realized she was only capturing me when I looked terrible. Messy hair from hiking, unflattering angle while eating, caught mid chew, or when I was frustrated and arguing. Meanwhile, every single photo of her was perfectly posed and filtered. So while she was in the bathroom touching up her makeup for the 10th time that day, I grabbed her phone. She'd left it unlocked on the counter next to the sink. I scrolled through her camera roll and found the absolute worst photo she'd taken all weekend of herself. Double chin, eyes half closed, food stuck in her teeth, hair a complete disaster. It was from when she was laughing too hard at one of Joseph's jokes and snorting. I posted it to her Instagram story.

The speed that you're traveling, by the time you actually hit the water, it will be the same as if you were hitting concrete. This is called surface tension. Purpose tension is the reason why Olympic swimming pools have little sprinklers shooting into the water. It rattles up the water a little bit, allowing the divers to enter the water like this instead of like this. And I don't know about you, but regardless of how much I know about surface tension, it still seems like if my parachute malfunctions, I should still aim for the water. But no. Surface tension. Science, blah blah blah. However, regardless of how annoying surface tension is, without it, our lives would be miserable. How so? Let me explain. Imagine you're walking through your apartment with a glass of water. You trip and fall and spill the glass of water on the floor, creating a puddle. Surface tension is the reason why the puddle of water is only this big and not this big covering every surface area of ground on your apartment floor. Literally without surface tension, if you spilled a glass of water on the floor, it would travel all over the floor about two microns deep. Meaning every time you spilled water, it would literally be impossible to clean all of it up.

I was at my girlfriend's family dinner when her dad announced I had to participate in their family tradition for new boyfriends. What started as a simple test became the longest night of my life. I've been dating her for six months. She finally invited me to Sunday dinner with her parents. I was nervous, but excited to make a good impression. I brought flowers for her mom and wore my nicest shirt. Everything was going perfectly. Her mom was sweet, asking about my job and college plans. Her dad seemed friendly enough, talking about sports and making jokes. I was starting to relax when he suddenly got serious. We have a family tradition, he announced after we finished eating. Every boyfriend who wants to keep dating my daughter has to pass a little test. I laughed nervously. What kind of test? Nothing too crazy, he said with a smile that didn't reach his eyes. Just proves you're serious about her. My girlfriend looked uncomfortable but didn't say anything. Her mom kept clearing dishes like nothing was happening. I figured it would be some harmless dad joke or maybe answering relationship questions. Her dad disappeared into the kitchen and came back with a small glass filled with dark liquid. He set it in front of me with Ceremony. Family hot sauce, he explained. Made it myself with special ingredients. Every boyfriend drinks a shot to join the Family. The smell hit me immediately. It was like someone had liquefied pure fire and mixed it with vinegar. My eyes started watering just from being near it. Dad. My girlfriend started, but he held up his hand. Tradition is tradition. Unless he's too weak to handle a little spice. I looked around the table. Everyone was watching me like this was completely normal. I picked up the glass and took the shot. The pain was instant and overwhelming. My mouth felt like it was melting. Tears streamed down my face as I tried not to show how much it hurt. But I made it through. Good. Her dad nodded. But that was just the first test.

Expensive cars in the driveway and uniformed people walking around. This is where you grew up? I asked. She nodded, but looked embarrassed. This is why I don't talk about family stuff. Inside was even crazier. Three story ceiling, paintings that looked like they belonged in museums. Furniture you see in magazines. Her dad came out to meet us. Nice guy, but wearing a watch that probably cost more than I make in six months. He talked about family business like it was no big deal. Her mom showed me photos from their newest business location. Over these. During dinner cooked by a chef, her little brother complained about his sports car being in the shop. Her sister was planning some charity event. And there I was thinking, my girlfriend worked at a coffee shop to pay rent. After we went to bed in their guest room, bigger than my entire apartment. I asked her why. She never told me. She said her last boyfriend only stayed with her once he found out about the money. He kept asking her to buy him stuff and pay for expensive trips. Made her feel like a credit card to. When we met. You never tried to impress me with money or ask me to pay for Things you liked me for who I am, not what my family has. So I wanted to keep it that way.

How did you find out? I've been dating this girl for seven months. She seemed normal, maybe even struggling financially. She always wanted to split bills, wore simple clothes, drove this old car that made weird noises. When we went out, it was usually cheap places or free stuff, like hiking. Her apartment was tiny, one bedroom with yard sale furniture. She worked part time at a coffee shop and talked about saving money for rent. I felt bad because I made more than her, but she insisted on paying her own way. She never mentioned family much. They lived across the country and she didn't see them often. When I asked about holidays, she changed the subject. Then one day she got this phone call that changed everything. We were watching movies when her phone rang.

What kind of business? She looked at Me like she was deciding whether to tell the truth. He owns some companies. Like a lot of companies. The next week, she asked if I wanted to meet her parents. She seemed nervous. Kept saying they were different and I shouldn't judge her. We flew first class, which seemed weird because she always acted like money was tight when I mentioned it. Said her dad booked the tickets. At the airport, there was a guy in a suit holding a sign with her name. Not a taxi driver, but an actual chauffeur with an expensive black car. The drive took us through neighborhoods I'd only seen in movies. Huge houses with gate

By 9, I could forge their signatures perfectly and knew exactly how to calm her meltdowns. By 16, I scheduled her doctor visits and set alarms to give her medicine on time.

But I told them I couldn't leave Eve alone, not when she needed someone who understood her routines and could advocate for her at school.

All this time working to afford the best life for you two, and we haven't even been here to live it with you. Dad couldn't look at me when he finally spoke. Starting tomorrow, being here comes first. And for three beautiful months, they became the best parents. Dad Learned Eve's morning routine, mom attended parent teacher conferences, and they both showed up to her sophomore year orientation. Eve called me at Stanford listing every dinner detail they used. The smooth plates. Dad didn't mix her foods. Mom turned the TV volume to 16, not 17. They and photos of themselves at her art showcase. And Eve's smile in those pictures made the homesickness worth it. She even called one night. Very serious. I have a boyfriend, mom, and dad like him. He helps me at school. I felt grateful hearing her sound happy about normal teenage things. But when I came home two years later for her graduation, I realized she was living anything but a normal.

I was sitting in the ICU painting my granddad's nails when the nurses told me he only had days left to live. My parents died when I was eight, and he was the only family I had. That's when I felt a vibration on my inner thigh. It was a call from my best friend, Bianca. Hey, so what are you wearing to my birthday tomorrow night? Oh, I don't think I'll be able to come. I responded. I felt like a terrible friend for canceling so last minute, but I had no choice. Are you freaking serious right now? What will everyone think when my best friend isn't at my party? You have to come, Bianca. My granddad's dying. I kept it private, my gosh, she interrupted. Now you're making my birthday about you? My parents literally spent $9,000 on party supplies alone. Just admit you're jealous that you're broke and I'm turning 21 first. Luckily, I had AirPods in, so my granddad couldn't hear her BS, and I hung up. She started spamming me with texts that were even worse than her call, but I felt like a petty hoe that day, so I made a group chat of our entire friend group without her and sent every screenshot. Mia called immediately. Babe, I'm so sorry about your granddad. Also, Bianca's cancelled. But listen, I have an idea that's downright evil. Within an hour, my Granddad's hospice waiting room was filled with young girls determined to cheer him up. Girl Mia announced Bianca's birthday party. I want your grandad to be happy. My eyes welled up with tears as I realized every other girl in our friend group felt the same way. I wasn't even mad at Bianca for leaking my secret. That's when Tori jumped in. My mom owns that catering company. She'll donate everything for your grandad's final party. I'll make a Facebook event, said Sienna. Private at first, then public an hour before. Wait, said Jess, showing her phone. Bianca's already posting about her exclusive VIP list. She's bragging about how selective she's being. Perfect. Let's be even more exclusive. Celebrating Harold's beautiful life. Final gathering. The planning was intricate. We created shifts so. And I wouldn't be overwhelmed. I'll coordinate transportation for all his elderly friends. Ashley volunteered. My boyfriend's in a jazz quartet. They'll play for free. Additory. The group chat was fire. Everyone Bianca had invited was asking subtle questions. Not about her, but about my granddad. Hey, did you hear about Okey's granddad? Is it true he raised her alone? Was he really a war

The fifteen thousand dollar graduation trip to Europe I sent for Diego three months ago. The silence was deafening. My mom started fidgeting with her new designer purse, the one that mysteriously appeared last month along with matching shoes. My dad's gold chain suddenly felt heavier around his neck.

If you stole from your own son. That's when it all clicked. The sudden shopping sprees every weekend. My sister's new iPhone, iPad and MacBook. Family vacation to Cancun that I wasn't invited to. The kitchen renovation. Dad's new motorcycle sitting in our driveway. They'd stolen my graduation gift and spent it on themselves like it was Christmas morning. My sister Estania, who never worked a day in her life, was wearing earrings that cost more than my monthly gas station salary. Diamond studs that sparkled under the restaurant lights. She. I couldn't even look up from her plate, too busy admiring her fresh manicure. You gave them everything their entire lives, I said quietly, my voice shaking with years of suppressed anger. And they took The one thing meant for me. The one thing I actually earned. Grandma stood up, her chair scraping against the floor loud enough to make nearby diners turn. 20 years I've watched you favor Estania over Diego like he's invisible. I sent that money specifically for him. With a letter explaining every detail of the trip I planned. My mom's face went white as paper. We never got a letter, I swear. Because you threw it away after cashing the check that had his name on it. The restaurant felt silent, despite other diners around us. Even the waiters seemed to sense the drama unfolding at our table. I couldn't hold back anymore. This explains everything. Why you suddenly had money for mom's Botox appointments and weekly spa days. Why dad bought that Harley Davidson he's been wanting for years. Why Estania got her nose job and started posting

I delivered pizza to the same woman every night for three weeks before I finally realized that she was being murdered. She placed the exact same online order at six PM every day like clockwork. Medium pepperoni with extra cheese and one bottle of Coke. And she always included special instructions. That seemed way too personal for a pizza order. While I was trying to deliver smiles and the familiar comfort of a fresh baked pie, I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something horribly wrong in apartment 5D. At first her notes seemed innocent enough, saying things like have a blessed day or stay safe out there, which was actually pretty sweet compared to most customers. After two weeks of these daily deliveries, though, I realized something that made my skin crawl. The first letter of each word spelled out something completely different. One day it said hope everything looks perfect, which spelled help, and I thought maybe I was imagining things. The next day it said hurry up, Robert, terrific service, which spelled H U R T S. And I knew this wasn't a coincidence anymore because my name is actually Jeremy. This woman was trying to tell me something without being able to say it out loud. When I really looked at her for the first time, instead of just going through the motions, she seemed like she was dying in front of Me! Her skin had this grayish tint that reminded me of my grandfather before his kidneys failed and her hands shook so bad she could barely hold the pizza box. The special instructions kept getting more desperate with messages like drivers appreciate your service spelling D A Y S, which confused me until the next one said love every favorite topping spelling left and I realized she was telling me how much time she had. Another said seriously amazing various experiences spelling S A V E and many employees spelling M E. But what really convinced me was when she started writing on the cash tips.

She made me wait outside the bathroom every morning while she did her 45 minute skincare routine, straightening already perfect hair while I stood there with toothpaste dripping down my chin. When guys came over to study, she'd parade rue in her cutest outfits, telling them about my pizza face and how I used to eat glue in kindergarten. Natural beauty can't be bought, she'd tell her parents when I complained about needing dermatology appointment. Paris needs to learn that personality matters more than looks. The worst part? She'd leave her expensive products all over the bathroom. Half used bottles of retinol and vitamin C serums. She'd abandon then for the next trending thing. But somehow I was the one wasting money. London loved reminding me how I'd never get asked to prom. You'll probably die a virgin, she'd laugh. Some of us are just meant to be beautiful, High school ended, London went straight to working at the mall because she wanted to get to discovered as a model. Translation she thought her looks would carry her through life. She spent every paycheck on tanning packages and highlights, living for the weekend parties.

The school nurse called home. They both showed up and blamed each other for starving me. Dinner would be silent. We'd sit at the same table, but they'd cook separate meals. Mom made pasta, dad made sandwiches. They'd eat at the same time, stare straight ahead. If I wanted food, I had to ask both. Usually got told no by both. Ask your mother, ask your father. Circle of rejection. Birthdays were weapons. Mom would throw a party and not tell dad. He'd Come home to strangers in the house. Next year, dad would take me to Chuck E. Cheese without telling mom. She'd call the cops reporting a kidnapping. The cops knew our address by heart. Officer Desanto brought my 10th birthday present. A journal. You're gonna need therapy, he said. I stopped wanting birthdays by age 10. Then they started communicating through me. Tell your mother I paid the water Bill. Tell your father he's three days late. I was 11 years old, delivering divorce threats across the dinner table. By 12, I was writing their hate messages down because they wanted documentation. I have three notebooks full of their messages to each other through me. When I was 13, mom started dating. She'd bring men home while dad was in the house.

When I was 12, my mom married Richard, a pediatric surgeon who seemed perfect on paper. He moved us into his massive house, bought me the latest iPhone, and always bragged about having a stepson. I remember thinking how lucky I was, especially when he take me to his hospital and let me shadow him while he worked with kids. But everything changed when my little brother Tommy was born. Richard became obsessed with making Tommy a medical prodigy. He'd force him to study anatomy flashcards instead of playing with toys. By age 4, Tommy could name every bone in the human body. But he'd never been to a playground. I started noticing bruises on Tommy's arms. When I asked, Richard said they were for surgery. He'd make Tommy practice sutures on oranges for hours, squeezing his wrist until it bruised if his stitches weren't perfect. My mom worked night shifts as a nurse, so she rarely saw what happened. When I told her, Richard convinced her I was jealous of Tommy's special education. He even showed her videos of Tommy perfectly reciting medical terms, saying, see? He loves learning. One night, I heard Tommy crying in the study. I found Richard forcing him to memorize surgical procedures, clapping his face each time he made a mistake. Tommy was shaking, holding an ice pack to his cheek. That's when I started recording everything on my phone. For three months, I gathered evidence videos of Richard screaming at Tommy for mispronouncing medical terms, photos of bruises, audio of Tommy begging not to do more training. I even caught Richard threatening to break Tommy's fingers if he didn't complete his practice sutures. The worst was when Tommy got a B+ on his kindergarten science test. Richard locked him in the basement medical lab for hours, making him practice procedures on

I'm 18, and my mom left me alone on my birthday to take her new husband and his kids to Disney World. You're too old for family trips anyway, she said, while packing matching Mickey Mouse shirts for everyone but me. See, my mom remarried when I was 15 to this guy Dave, who came with two bratty kids. From day one, they treated me like an intruder in my own home. The kids got the master bedroom upstairs, while I was banished to the basement. Family game nights. I wasn't invited. Christmas morning, they opened presents while I watched from the kitchen. Mom completely transformed into this new person, desperate to prove she was the perfect stepmom. Every weekend was about Dave's kids. Soccer games, birthday parties, shopping trips. Meanwhile, I worked part time at a grocery store just to buy my own food, because somehow the family grocery budget never included me. But here's the thing. My grandmother left me this house when she passed two years ago. The will was crystal clear. The house goes directly to me. At 18, mom was just supposed to be the temporary caretaker until then. Except she conveniently forgot to mention this little detail to Dave when they got married. I discovered this when I started digging through Grandma's old papers in the attic and found the will. I contacted the lawyer who handled Grandma's estate. Your mother was supposed to inform you about this inheritance when you turned 16, he explained. She's been legally obligated to maintain the property for you, not make major changes without permission.

Look, when I was 12, I wasn't exactly known for making good life decisions. My crowning achievement up until that point was hiding in the bathroom for an entire gym class and convincing everyone I'd been locked in by accident. So when I forgot to do my history homework, my brain naturally went, time for a bold lie. I went with the classic my dog ate my homework. Now, normally, this should have been a quick exchange. Teacher rolls eyes, I get a zero, life moves on. But my teacher, Mrs. Reynolds, was built different. She didn't even blink. She just folded her arms and said, bring me proof. Proof? I froze like I just been caught trying to smuggle a raccoon into an airport. I, I stammered out an okay and sat back down, my heart pounding. Since when do teachers fact check homework excuses all day? I was panicking at lunch. I told my best friend Derek. He immediately said, easy, just have your dog chew it up tonight. Which, yes, is logical. But my actual homework was steam and untouched in my bag. If I use that, she'd know I was lying. So naturally, I went full CIA black Ops mode. Step one, I printed a fresh copy of the homework so there was no trace of my handwriting. Step 2, I covered it in peanut butter. Not a little. I'm talking a thick smear that could Glue a toddler to a wall. Step three. I called in the star of the operation, my dog, Kevin. Now, Kevin is not a small dog. He's a 90 pound golden retriever who thinks paper is just seasoning for whatever food is on it. At first, he sniffed the page suspiciously. Then, chaos. He shredded it, drooled on it, and somehow managed to embed one of his own hairs into the pulp.

Last night I realized it's a real murder that happens tomorrow. And he's the killer. For three years, every single night, my eight year old son, Ethan has insisted on the exact same bedtime story. Not from a book. He wants me to tell it from memory. If I change even one word, he screams until I start over. Tell me about the red door house, he always says. So I tell him. Once there was a yellow house with a red door at 47 Maple street. Inside lived Mrs. Carpenter, who made cookies every Sunday. She had three cats, muffin, buttons and snowball. One night, a little boy knocked on her red door exactly seven times. The story continues the same way. Every time. The boy asks for water, Mrs. Carpenter lets him in. He goes to her kitchen, takes a knife from the third drawer, and does something I always describe vaguely as a bad thing that made Mrs. Carpenter go to sleep forever. Then he leaves through the back door, counts to 100, and goes home. I thought I made it up. Some half asleep nonsense I created three years ago when Ethan wouldn't stop crying. But he latched onto it, demanding it word for word every night. Last night, after I finished the story, Ethan asked something new. Daddy, is 47 Maple street far from here? There is no 47 Maple street. But it's Just a story. Yes, there is. I looked it up on your phone. It's only six blocks away. My blood went cold. I grabbed my phone and searched. He was right. 47 Maple street existed six blocks from our house. A yellow house with a red door, according to the real estate listing owner, Dorothy Carpenter. I stayed up all night researching. Dorothy Carpenter was 73, lived alone, had three cats. According to her Facebook, the cat. Cats names made me drop my phone. Muffin buttons and snowball. This morning, I drove past her house. Yellow with a red door, exactly as I've been describing for three years. But I've never seen it before. We moved here only three years ago, and I never go that route. I called in sick to work and spent the day trying to rationalize this. Maybe I'd seen it subconsciously. Maybe Ethan had heard about it somewhere. But then I found something that destroyed any rational explanation. In my closet, buried in a box of old papers, I found a journal. I didn't remember keeping my handwriting, but I had no memory of writing it. The first entry was dated four years ago, before we

When I woke up, the plane was empty. Flying terrified me. I'd avoided it for 23 years until my sister's wedding in California forced my hand. The airport statistics didn't help. 86 commercial accidents last year, according to the departure board display. My hands shook. Boarding pass to the flight attendant. She had perfect white teeth and that practiced airline smile. Welcome aboard, sir. Seat 14A. Right down the aisle. I found my window seat and tried to calm down. Deep breaths. The cabin filled with passengers, families, business travellers. A crying baby in row six. Normal people doing normal things. Flying was routine for them. During take off, my chest felt like it would cave in from the pressure. When the plane hit turbulence and dropped suddenly, I yelled. A kid behind me giggled before his mom shushed him. My face burned with embarrassment. But after an hour, I started to relax. The flight attendant, her name tag said Rebecca, brought me water and asked if I was okay. First time flying, she said kindly. You're doing great. I watched movies on the screen, played simple games on the remote. The fear faded into boredom. Maybe flying wasn't so terrible after all. Around hour three, they dimmed the cabin lights to blue. Most passengers tried to sleep in the cramped seats. I decided to do the same. Anything to make time pass faster. That's when I heard the whispers. Soft Voices speaking just below the hum of the engines. My drowsy mind couldn't make out the words, but something felt wrong about the rhythm. The cadence was too regular, like chanting. I fell asleep anyway. I woke up to silence. Complete, absolute silence. No engine noise, no air circulation, no passenger sounds. I rubbed my eyes and looked around the cabin. Every seat was empty. Not just empty. They look like nobody had ever sat in them. No blankets, no pillows, no personal items. The overhead bins were closed. Even the baby's car seat was gone. I stumbled into the aisle, my heart hammering. Hello? I called out. Rebecca? Anyone? My voice echoed strangely in the empty space. I checked the bathrooms, the galley, every row of seats. Nothing. I pressed my face to a window and saw we were still flying. Dark sky, stars, the faint outline of clouds far below. I was alone on a plane at 30,000 feet. I ran toward the cockpit, but the cabin just kept going. Row after row of empty seats, all identical. The blue

Now I know why we moved so much when I was a kid. I don't usually celebrate birthdays anymore, but this year my dad surprised me with a package that showed up at my apartment door. Inside was a USB drive with a note in his messy handwriting. Emma's Home Movies, 1995 to 2000. Happy Birthday, sweetheart. I was excited because I barely remembered anything from when I was little. We moved around constantly when I I was a kid, and dad always said it was because of his job in construction, but we never stayed anywhere longer than two years. Most of our old photos got lost during one of the moves. I plugged the drive into my laptop and found dozens of video files organized by year. The quality was terrible, typical 90s camcorder footage. But seeing my younger self was amazing. I watched myself learning to walk, playing in various backyards, blowing out birthday candles in different houses. But something felt off in every video. We seem to be living in really nice houses with expensive furniture and big yards, way nicer than anything a construction worker could afford. I texted my dad asking about it, but he didn't respond. Then I got to the videos from 1997, when I would have been about 4 years old. The first clip showed me playing in a beautiful kitchen with marble countertops, while the woman's voice off camera encouraged Me. But it wasn't my mother's voice. Mom had died when I was two, and dad raised me alone after that. Who's that good girl? The woman said. Emma. Such a good helper. I paused the video. The woman sounded middle aged, kind. Nothing like the babysitter's dad occasionally hired. Watching and saw glimpses of her shadow moving around, but the camera never showed her face. The next video was dated three weeks later. Same kitchen, but now I was sitting at the table, crying, while Dad's voice tried to comfort me from behind the camera. It's okay, sweetheart. The nice lady had to go away. We're going to live somewhere new now. A chill ran down my spine. The timeline was adding up to something horrible. I jumped to 1998. New house, different kitchen, but the same pattern. Another woman's voice talking to me, teaching me to tie my shoes. Emma, you're getting so big. Soon you'll be starting kindergarten. Then three weeks later, the same scenario. Me crying, dad comforting me. Talk about moving again.

But the contract was weird. No photos allowed, no discussing work details, mandatory on site housing. It's just NDAs and corporate stuff, he told me over the phone after his first week. Monsters here are insane, though, Blake. Like, movie quality realistic. I can't believe they're just costume. He called me every Sunday for two months. Always excited, always raving about how authentic everything looked. Then the calls got shorter. Stranger. Blake, you know how some actors are just naturally gifted? He asked during what would be our last conversation. Like they become the character completely. Some of these guys never break character. Ever. That was three weeks ago. Yesterday. I got a text from his number at 3:00am. They're not costumes. Don't come looking for me. Tell mom I'm sorry. I drove to Darkwood Park immediately. The receptionist, a pale woman with hollow eyes, said Ethan had quit without notice, no forwarding address. When I asked to speak with management, she just stared at me until I left. But I didn't leave. I parked outside the employee housing complex behind the park and waited. At sunset, workers started trickling out. Some looked normal, tired. Carrying backpack, chatting on phones. Others moved differently, mechanical, like they were concentrating on walking upright. One of the normal workers, a girl, maybe 19, approached my car. You're looking for someone, aren't you? She whispered, glancing nervously at the other employees. Her name was Whitney. She worked there four months. Your brother trained me, she said.

Last week, I found out the horrifying reason why. My dad has been feeding people in our basement for as long as I can remember. Every night at exactly 8:47, he would grab the leftover dinner, walk downstairs for 20 minutes, then come back up with an empty plate. I used to think this was completely normal until I realized how messed up it actually was. When I was 6, I asked my mom about the voices coming from downstairs. She just lit another cigarette and said, your father handles the basement handle upstairs. Her hands were shaking the whole time she said it. I could tell she was scared, but I didn't know why. The basement door was always locked with this huge deadbolt. I tried opening it once when I was eight, and my dad caught me. His face went completely white. He told me to never go down there because they weren't ready to meet me yet. But I could hear them. A little girl singing, A baby crying at three in the morning. Christmas was the weirdest time because my dad would bring two sets of presents. One pile for me and another armload that disappeared downstairs. I'd hear kids screaming with excitement while I opened my gifts alone upstairs. Mom would just chain smoke by the window, staring at nothing. When I turned 12, everything changed. The singing stopped. No more laughter, no more voices. Just Complete silence. But dad still brought food down every single night. He'd come back up faster, though, looking sick. Mom started drinking wine for breakfast. Convinced my best friend Trevor to sleep over that weekend. Maybe if someone else was there, dad would finally explain what was going on.

I thought it was cute at first, you know, made me feel like she really thought things through. But Last Saturday, I asked her something that's been eating at me since. Why did you marry me? I was expecting some romantic answer about how much she loves me or how I make her laugh or whatever normal couple stuff. She looked at me dead serious and said, because you asked. I thought she was joking, so I laughed it off, but then I pushed a little more. Okay, but, like, what made you say yes, though? And this woman, my wife of three years, looks me straight in the eye and says, because I trust your judgment. I just stared at her. What the hell does that even mean? So I asked her to explain, and she went into full professor mode. She told me love isn't enough to marry someone. That when she was in college, she was head over heels for this guy named Tyler, who was basically a walking disaster. Good looking, charming, but had no goals, no t shirts and energy drinks.

Losers get the basement. My younger brother, Marvin, pushed his food around his plate. My sister Bianca wouldn't even look up. We've been doing this for three months since we moved to this house. The basement had exposed pipes. heat. And spiders that dropped from the ceiling at night. Bianca won last month with her debate trophy. Dad continued, pulling out his notebook. So she keeps the room unless one of you beats her achievements this month. The chicken tasted like cardboard in my mouth. This is insane. Other families don't do this. Mom smile tightened. Other families raise weak children. We're raising winners. That night, Bianca came to my basement corner, where I'd hung sheets for privacy. I'm sorry, she whispered. Didn't wanna win, but sleeping down here made me sick last time. It's not your fault, I said, but the words felt hollow. Marvin had already stopped talking to both of us. The next morning, dad posted the point chart on the refrigerator. 10 points for A's, 20 for sports victories, 15 for volunteer hours, even five points for who said good morning first. I watched Marvin set his alarm for 4:00am. Just to beat us to the by week two, Bianca started hiding my homework. I found it crumpled in the trash after getting a zero. Marvin put a dead spider in my backpack during lunch, making me scream in front of everyone. We stopped eating together. Stop helping each other with assignments. Three kids living in the same house, acting like enemies. Look at that competitive spirit! Dad beamed one morning after Marvin and Bianca physically fought over who got to take out the trash for points. Mom took photos like it was something to be proud of. My grades started slipping from the stress. I couldn't sleep in the freezing basement constantly.

Last month, he actually said, and I quote, I just don't know what I'd do with a girl. When I asked him what he meant, he got all defensive and said he was just worried about teenage years and dating and stuff, but something felt off. We didn't do a gender reveal with Connor because Jake kept changing his mind about when he wanted to find out. We ended up learning it was a boy like three weeks before I gave birth, and Jake literally cried tears of joy in the doctor's office. So two weeks ago, Jake said maybe I should just go to my appointment alone and find out without him. He said he was too nervous and would rather wait for the party.

He hasn't aged a single day. When I started teaching third grade at Rosewood Elementary, I thought I'd seen everything. But nothing prepared me for Ryan. He showed up on the second day of school clutching a class assignment sheet that said, Room 12, Mess Carter. Ryan Blackwood. I didn't remember his name on my roster, but kids get enrolled late all the time. Ryan was 8 years old. Blond hair, green eyes, small scar above his left eyebrow. Quiet kid who always sat in the back corner. Wore the same red hoodie every day. At the end of third grade, Ryan's parents apparently decided he needed to repeat the year. Academic struggles, they said. Weird, because Ryan was one of my brightest students. Fourth year of teaching, same thing. Ryan showed up again, clutching that assignment sheet. Same red hoodie, same corner seat. Still 8 years old. Fifth year, same Ryan. Same assignment sheet, same eight year old face. Sixth year, I started taking photos. Ryan in September looked identical to Ryan from five years ago. Same height, same baby teeth, same everything. Seventh year, I confronted the principal, showed her the photos. That's not the same child, she said. This year's student is Robert Blackwood, Ryan's younger brother. I looked at the photos again. Name on this year's assignment sheet had changed to Robert Blackwood in my hands. Eighth year, was Richard Blackwood. Same face, same scar. Same red hoodie that never faded. Ninth year brought Russell Blackwood. I started documenting everything. Every year, a new Blackwood boy who looked precisely like Ryan from five years ago. But in year 10, something changed. This year's assignment sheet read Ronald Blackwood. But when I looked at his face, his green eyes had no pupils, just solid green, like marbles. His skin had a waxy, artificial texture. During recess, he sat perfectly still for 30 minutes. Didn't move, didn't blink. Other kids played around him like he wasn't there. Ronald, are you okay? I asked. He turned his head toward me with a mechanical click. I'm fine, Miss Carter. His voice sounded hollow, like it was coming from inside a tunnel.

Some bridges need burning. My sister demanded I sleep with her husband to give them a baby because she was infertile. Rachel had always been the golden child, who once faked a cancer scare to steal attention at my wedding and later sued her bridesmaid for getting pregnant before her big day. She got dad's business connections and mom's jewellery collection while I scraped by with community college loans, then married rich and spent her days posting filtered photos or telling my seven year old daughter she was too fat for dance class. When I miscarried last year, she posted about it on Facebook before I could tell anyone, adding prayer hands, emojis and everything happens for reason while collecting sympathy likes. But now, after five years of her trying to conceive a baby, family suddenly meant everything to her. Her obsession with natural conception had cost them hundreds of thousands of dollars on fertility crystals and moon ceremonies. She refused IVF, calling it artificial poison, and wouldn't consider adoption because she needed to know her child's genetics. During Sunday dinner, she stared at my kids with tears streaming down her face, gripping her husband's hand until her knuckles turned white. That's when mom leaned over and whispered, you know, you have such beautiful children, and you and Rachel share the same DNA. And then two weeks later, the spa day invitation. That should have been my first warning, but I thought maybe she wanted To reconnect. Instead, I walked into her living room to find mom already there, both of them wearing matching silk robes and expectant. We have the perfect solution, Rachel announced, gesturing for me to sit between them. You're going to sleep with Dave and give us a baby naturally, the way nature intended. She said it like she was asking to borrow a cup of sugar, while mom nodded along like this was discussing vacation plan. I couldn't believe I was actually considering it. And Rachel didn't spare a second in sending me ovulation tracking apps and insisting I take fertility tests at her private clinic. She wore me down with daily phone calls and surprise visits, always with mom as backup. But then I found myself sitting in her marble bathroom letting her inject me with hormones. She had me taking supplements that made my skin crawl and my emotions swing wildly. My husband slammed doors and accused me of being insane for even considering it. I moved to his parents house. Well, I just kept hoping she come to her senses. Everything changed the day I was holding laundry and heard her on the phone with her best friend laughing about something. Dave asked for an open marriage last year, she said. My hands froze on a tiny pink shirt. This kills two birds. He gets his variety.

Three years ago, my coworker and I got married in Vegas for a work visa. The plan was brilliant. I needed to stay in the country. He needed my health insurance for his daughter's surgery. Quick courthouse wedding, two years of fooling immigration, then a quiet divorce. We high fived after signing the papers like we just pulled off a heist. We had. The first year was pure performance art. We memorized each other's birthdays, allergies, childhood pets. I Learned he takes his coffee with three sugars. He Learned I sleep on the left side. Immigration interviewed us twice. We passed by knowing things real couples probably didn't. We'd studied each other like a test. His daughter Emma called me daddy's friend even though I was at every soccer game. We had rules. No dating others for two years. Too risky. Separate bedrooms when no one was watching. Joint bank account for show. Separate finances for real. We wore our rings to work and family events. Took them off at home. Mine lived on my keychain, his in his gym bag. Year two, the lines blurred. I started making his coffee without thinking he'd already be on the left side of the couch, leaving my spot open. Emma started calling me by my name instead of daddy's friend. When she got sick. I drove them to the E R. At 3 a m. Without him asking. Stayed for seven hours. That Wasn't for immigration. We joke about our divorce party we throw in. Six months, made a Pinterest Board of freedom cakes. His mom kept asking when we'd give her grandchildren. We'd laugh and say, after the divorce, when she couldn't hear. She never knew it was fake. Still doesn't. Eight months ago, I was offered a job in London. Dream position, triple salary. I said yes immediately. The marriage was almost over anyway. That night he cooked dinner. Real dinner, not our usual takeout. So you're leaving? He said, not looking up from the cutting board. After the divorce

Daddy? My teenage daughter started getting mysterious phone calls every afternoon. And I thought it was just normal teenager stuff. But then I noticed the pattern. Every day at 3:30 p m, her phone would ring with an unknown number. She'd immediately stop whatever she was doing and answer. On the first ring, her whole demeanor would change instantly. Voice dropping to a whisper, shoulders hunching forward, quickly walking to her room. When I. I asked who was calling, she'd just say, nobody important and close her door. Her behaviour started changing in other ways, too. She stopped hanging out after school. No more drama club meetings. No more study groups at the library. She'd rush home every single day, anxiously checking her phone every few minutes until that call came through. My husband thought I was being paranoid. She's 15. Girls have secrets. This is completely normal behaviour. But my mom instincts were screaming that something was seriously wrong. I started paying closer attention to these calls. She'd be on them for hours. Sometimes I could hear her through the door, speaking so quietly I couldn't make out words. But the tone was strange. Gentle, patient. Almost like she was comforting someone. No giggling like when she talked to friends. No complaining like when she talked to us. Just this soft, careful voice I'd never heard her use before. One afternoon, I was folding laundry outside her room when I heard her say something that made me freeze. I love you too, dad. See you tomorrow. Same time. My blood ran cold instantly. Her father was literally downstairs watching TV. Who was she calling? Dad? I knocked on her door immediately. She opened it, phone already hidden behind her back. Her face was red, eyes puffy, like she been crying. Everything okay, sweetie? I asked, trying to keep my voice casual. Fine, mom. Just talking to a friend about homework. But I saw her call log notification still glowing on her smartwatch. 2 hours and 43 minutes. What? Homework discussion lasted almost

I picked up my daughter Zoe from school Tuesday afternoon, and when I leaned over to kiss her forehead like I always did, she jerked away. Don't, dad. Miss Novak taught us that when you get kissed, the person's DNA stays inside you for seven years, like you're infected. She said, we're collecting other people's gross stuff and can't ever get it out. Her eyes welled up. Mom kissed me goodbye this morning. Does that mean I have her gross DNA stuck in me now? My hands tightened on the steering wheel. I teach AP biology at the high school across town. And not only was this scientifically false, it was psychologically damaging. That evening, I sent Miss Novak a polite email explaining that I was Zoe's father and a biology teacher, and that DNA from saliva breaks down within hours, not years. Her reply came quickly. Mr. Coleman, it was a simple lesson on DNA and germs. You know, how kids can traumatize things. Wouldn't worry about it. I tried to brush it off, figuring maybe she just misspoken or Zoe had misunderstood. But then Wednesday morning, Zoe refused breakfast, and when I asked why, she pushed her bowl away and said, yesterday Miss Novak was crying in class. She kept talking about this guy she used to date, like, three years ago. She said she can still feel his gross DNA inside her from when They kissed him and she called him a walking contamination or something. I nearly choked on my coffee. She's discussing her ex boyfriend with 12 year olds. Zoe nodded miserably. She was actually crying, dad. She said guys like Brad just want to infect girls with their DNA and then leave them. It was really weird. By Thursday, the parent group chat explode. Multiple children had come home terrified of physical contact. One mother wrote that her daughter wouldn't hug her uncle anymore because Miss Novak said men spread more DNA than women. Another parent said their son was dehydrated because he refused to use the water fountain after Miss Novak said drinking from it was basically like kissing everyone who used it before you, collecting years of their DNA in your mouth. First thing Friday morning, I met with Prince Vazquez alongside three other concerned parents. We presented our concerns about Miss Novak, discussing her personal dating life and teaching false science. The principal reviewed her file and found two previous complaints.

My sister Gwen told mom I was a domestic terrorist for taking 20 minute showers before school. And mom believed her. Gwen used to be cool when we were younger.

She start acting like a house was her personal hotel and everyone else was just in her way. First it was the TV. She changed all the streaming passwords so only she could log in. Even told our twelve year old brother to grow up when he wanted to watch cartoons on Saturday morning while she binged Love Island all day. Now, apparently, my bathroom was her territory, too. I tried to be considerate, I really did. I'd set my alarm 10 minutes earlier so I could be done before she woke up. I kept my shampoo and stuff in a basket so everything was clean and organized and she wanted to use it. And still she complained. Gwen told our parents I was hogging the bathroom every morning, even though I showered an hour before she woke up. She complained that the steam from my hot showers made the bathroom more moldy and toxic and gave her asthma. But it was summer, so I only took cold showers. Mom scolded me, telling Me to be more considerate of my sister. But that only made her lies older. She started setting her alarm for 6:00am just to me in the bathroom. Then she'd tell our parents I woke her up. So mom scolded me again, texting, be quieter next time. Your sister needs sleep. The lie that really got me into trouble was when Gwen claimed she lost her dream job at a marketing firm because I hogged the bathroom that morning. I finished my shower when I heard her phone blaring job interview today over and over. But Gwen was dead asleep. Now, I could have let her miss it, you know, especially after everything she done. But I still tried to wake her up. I shook her shoulders, turned on the lights, even pulled off her blankets. Nothing worked. When she finally did wake up, she had 20 minutes to get to her interview. She came home sobbing, mascara running down her

Three months after my wife died from cancer, my mother in law started going after me. She'd been staying with us to help with my nine year old daughter, Megan. And at first I was thankful, but then. And Megan came to me, twisting her hands together and said, daddy, why does grandma keep asking when we're selling the house and moving somewhere cheap? That should have been my warning sign. The real trouble began when she called CPS herself, telling them I was neglecting Megan and leaving her home alone while I slept all day from depression. The case worker, Miss Lane, showed up with her clipboard already out and her pen clicking. And two days later, my mother in law filed for emergency custody. I tried explaining I work from home, but Lane just kept her eyes on her notepad, scribbling away. And my chest got tight watching her write down whatever story she'd already decided was true. My lawyer, Tom, was the only one who believed my side of things. When I brought him the custody papers, I watched his eyebrows shoot up as he spread them across his mahogany desk, pointing to different sections where my mother in law had brought up the life insurance trust fund three times in documents that were supposed to be about Megan safety. Why would she keep mentioning money and papers about keeping Megan safe? Tom tapped the papers with his Pen and said we needed to look deeper into her motivations. That's when pieces started falling into place. Bought a leather journal and started tracking everything. After Miss UNT. Lane's second surprise visit, the pattern was obvious. Once I started writing it down. Lane would show up unannounced with her clipboard, and somehow my mother in law's silver car would appear within minutes. Every single time, she'd step out with her hand pressed over her heart. Playing the worried grandmother perfectly. Tom's investigator changed everything when he slid that Manila folder across the desk. My mother in law owed $200,000 in tax liens. The dates made my stomach drop. Filed just two months before

Carson was the biggest eighth grader anyone had ever seen. He looked like he spent time in prison and was pitching, not catching G, if you know what I mean. The kid was six feet tall with arms thicker than my legs. Meanwhile, Georgie was maybe 90 pounds, soaking wet, with these skinny arms that look like twigs. His left arm was in a homemade sling made from an old T-shirt. I stared at the money, thinking this had to be some kind of joke. Nobody in their right mind would pay someone to fight Carson.

My perfect daughter had 10,000 followers and was making money from ads while destroying girl girls lives over normal body changes. I couldn't believe this was my child. Three days later, Janet grabbed my arm at work with trembling hands. Her daughter had tried to end herself, leaving a note about the pregnancy shaming page. That night at dinner, Peyton's laugh made me flinch. She shoved her phone at me. Look at this girl claiming she just had a big lunch. It's so obviously a baby bump. My stomach dropped. It was Janet's daughter. I watched my child giggle at a girl who nearly died and felt something break inside me. For a whole week, I stayed up late studying how Peyton destroyed these girls. I made my own anonymous account and followed the same gossip pages she did. Every night after she went to bed, I'd scroll through her Posts learning exactly how she used those red arrows and shocked emojis. Her birthday was coming up and I knew she'd post from that Italian place she loved. When she posted birthday feast food baby that night my heart was pounding. I screenshot everything and opened the editing app. My hands trembled circling her stomach just like she'd done to dozens of girls. I typed popular volleyball player hiding pregnancy. Why else use the word baby and hit post at the exact time she always posted for maximum damage? I sat on my bed refreshing the page and watching my

My daughter was invited to a classmate's birthday party at a bowling alley. The event was an all girls party, and from what I could tell, there were about 17 girls in attendance. He arrived about five minutes late and walked in at the same time as another classmate, Betty. Due to a bit of a line, it took about 10 minutes for both girls to get their bowling shoes and head toward the reserved lanes. The hostess had booked three adjacent lanes. Like most bowling setups, each pair of lanes had a shared seating area with curved benches. When we got there, I noticed that lanes one and two already had several girls names programmed. On lane three, an adult male, someone I didn't recognize, was programming names into the system. When Annie approached the group, she was told to go to lane three. I greeted a few parents and noticed Annie walk away. I asked where she was going, and she said she'd been told to go find a blue bowling ball because it was lighter. I checked and realized the ball she was heading toward was actually 14 pounds. I went to find a lighter one and brought it back to her. A parent nearby asked if I was bowling. I said, no, just helping Annie get the right ball. At that moment, the dad of another girl, Called out to Betty that her name had been added to lane 2, and the birthday girl's mom, Dana, the hostess, came over. I asked her if Annie could be added to either lane one or two, assuming that all the girls would be mixed across the three lanes. Dana told me Annie was on lane three. I was surprised, so I walked over to look. Sure enough, Annie's name was on lane three. The only people bowling there were Annie and the adult male along with

Dude, you gotta help me, he said between sobs. Mom's in the hospital, and they're saying if we don't pay these bills right now, they're gonna stop her treatment. My stomach dropped.

I admit it. I messed up. I had forgotten my phone was on silent, and so for two hours straight, I sweated my butt off on Smash Bros. At my friend's house and forgot to text my girlfriend Cindy back. So when I finally saw her, 15 missed calls, she was furious. I need to know you're actually where you say you are, she said. But I already sent you my location and a picture of us on the coach. It's not enough. What if there are girls hiding behind you on the couch? Or what if it's just an old picture? I'm not stupid. From now on, when you're out, we video call so I can see. Or you can wake up single the next day. She hung up, practically foaming at the mouth. The first few calls were painfully awkward. I'd have to go around the house, introduce each of my friends to her, basically give her a house tour to show it's all clear before she hang up. And randomly call again in the next hour or so to make sure I didn't change locations or invited over girls to my friend's house. After a few days like this, everyone was going crazy over her rule. My friend Jeff pulled me to the side with a concerned look. Dude, honestly, if she's gonna act crazy, you gotta do it, too. That's when it came to me. A brilliant idea. The next time I was at Jeff's house, I answered Cindy's call in my best David Attenborough voice. Here we observe the male human in his natural habitat. Approaching the buffalo wings with caution, I slowly turned the camera towards my friends, who immediately caught on and started acting like wildlife. In the background, dinner was pretending to be a gazelle and Jeff was chest beating like a gorilla. Very funny, Cindy said, rolling her eyes at us. The next Friday, we took it further. I answered the call holding a microphone, reading out a fake weather forecast, while Jeff held up a map glued to a pizza box. Currently, we're experiencing a high pressure system of Mario Kart moving through the living room area, I announced. Temperatures are rising as we travel through Rainbow Road. Now back to you, Cindy. Stop being weird.

We adopted Jalen when he was 8. His birth mom was my younger sister who overdosed when he was 6, and his dad was nowhere to be found. I was 32 at the time with no kids of my own, and my husband Mike was completely on board. We figured we'd give Jalen the stable home he deserved after bouncing between foster homes for two years. Ellen was this quiet, serious kid who'd seen way too much for his age. He'd flinch whenever we raised our voices, even if we were just calling him for dinner from the other room. It took months before he'd laugh at my terrible dad jokes or let us hug him without going stiff. But slowly, he started opening up. He'd help Mike in the garage on weekends, asked me to pack extra snacks for school, started calling us mom and dad around his 10th birthday. For years, everything was perfect. Helen made good grades, played baseball in middle school, had friends over for sleepovers. We never hid his adoption from him, but he seemed completely settled with us. When he turned 16, I taught him to drive in our old Honda Civic. Mike took him fishing every summer. We were a real family. But then his senior year, something changed. Jalen started asking more questions about his birth family. Where they lived, if he had any siblings, what happened to his dad, I tried to be honest but gentle, telling him what little I knew. His birth mom had struggled with addiction, bounced around a lot, made poor choices. His dad had left when Jalen was 3 and never came back. One day in February, Jalen came home from school acting weird. He kept checking his phone during dinner and barely touched his food. When I asked what was wrong, he said some guy named Carlos had messaged him on Instagram, claiming to be his older half brother. My stomach dropped. I knew Carlos existed, but had hoped he'd never surface. Carlos was 19, lived about three hours away, and according to Jalen

There's a massive golden breadstick mounted on the wall like the freaking holy Grail. Now, a normal, functioning adult would see this and leave. But not me. Nope. I see a tower of pizza boxes on the kitchen island and think maybe it's just one of those quirky HOA things. So I grab a slice, sit down, and start eating. That's when papa Tony shows up.

On championship night, I was 5 feet 6 inches and 145 pounds as a high school freshman. The size of a decent seventh grader. My dad's jeans had cursed me with a body better suited for cross country than contact sports. But I didn't wanna run in circles. I wanted to play football. Coach Morris looked at me like I was roadkill when I showed up for tryouts. 30 seconds into my first drills, I heard it. Wilson, what are you doing here? The chess club meets in the library. The team erupted in laughter. Kept my mouth shut. Finish the drill. You're gonna get yourself killed out here, kid. Coach said afterward, why don't you try something else? Maybe track? I looked him straight in the eye. I wanna play. He sighed. Fine. You can be equipment manager, help with practice. Maybe in a few years, if you grow. So that's what I did. I washed jerseys, fixed helmets, set up cones and filled water bottles while the actual players got to play. After everyone left, I'd run the same drills they did. I set up tackling dummies and hit them until my shoulders ache. I studied playbooks like they were sacred tech. Junior year, I grown two inches and added 20 pounds of muscle. Still small, but solid. I tried out again. This time I didn't just run drills. I demolished them. My 40 yard dash was second fastest on the team. My route running was precise. My hands never dropped a pass. Not bad, coach admitted. But this isn't a practice drill. This is varsity football. Those guys across town would snap you like a twig. He put me on special teams. The Suicide Squad. Just bodies to throw at kick returns. First game of the season, I flew down the field on kickoff, weaving through blockers twice my size, and made a tackle that echoed through the stadium. The crowd erupted. Coach ignored it, called it lucky. Then I did it again the next game. And the next. By mid season, I forced two fumbles on kick returns. Fans started chanting will, son! Will, son! Whenever kickoff came. Except for Brandon Reeves, our star quarterback and the coach's godson. 6 foot 3, college scouts at every game. Arrogance as big as his arm. He made it his mission to.

It just makes perfect sense when you really think about it. I'm standing there confused. When she continues without missing a beat. Emma's going to move in next month with Dave, and they'll start.

My family discovered I was good with kids when I was 14 and babysat my cousin once. That single afternoon turned me into their unpaid nanny for the next 12 years. My sister would drop off her toddler for just an hour while she ran to target. One hour became three, then six, until she'd stroll back with fresh acrylic nails, a Starbucks Frappuccino, and zero apologies. I remember sitting on my bedroom floor surrounded by broken crayons and goldfish crackers, realizing I'd missed my entire shift at the local coffee shop because of her lies. Then my brother discovered the family gold mine. Midnight texts became routine. Emergency babysitting needed. The twins, regular sitter canceled. Of course, the emergency was always tickets to concerts, bar crawls, or weekend getaways with his girlfriend. I Learned to sleep with my phone on silent. College should have been my escape, but my family had other plans. My sister would show up unannounced at my dorm, sometimes driving four hours just to dump her kids on me for entire weekends. He cost me my first serious girlfriend when she called during our anniversary dinner screaming about a fake emergency. I watched her look at me across that candlelit table and say she couldn't compete with my family's chaos anymore. After graduation, things got worse. My parents, claiming they wanted to help me settle in, secretly made copies of My apartment keys and distributed them to my siblings like VIP passes. I dragged myself home from my marketing job exhausted from client presentations, only to find my living room transformed into a daycare center, toys scattered everywhere, juice boxes leaking on my white couch, and kids I hadn't even agreed to watch. My boss pulled me aside after I missed my third important presentation.

One. I had an Android phone which had a Google Cards feature option that could notify you like 15 minutes to home if you were out. I thought this feature was annoying and useless, so I kept the feature off. After several months of no card notifications, one night I'm at home and a card pops up saying 35 minutes to home, pinning me at a random intersection on the other side of town. Let's call it First Street in Story Avenue, I think. That's weird. I'm not even way over there. I don't even know where that is. I've never been to that area. I go to my card setting to turn it back off, but it's already turned off. That's weird. The next night the same thing happens. 35 minutes to home from 1st Saint Story. What the. Still definitely not over there. Check cards feature and the notifications are still turned off, so no idea why I'm getting a notification. A few days later, a friend and I are out running errands and he misses his intended exit, so he takes the next one. Once on the streets, I ask where are we? I've never been over here. a car to our right tries to turn left and crashes right into us. Messed up the wheel turning system, so we pulled forward to the curb to call a tow truck. We had our kids in the Car. So I called my sister to pick us all up. When my sister asks me for the location, I look up at the street signs. First Street and Story Avenue. 2 in college, I delivered pizzas to make money. I had a delivery that should have taken about 20 minutes. When I returned to the store, the manager asked me what had taken so long. I asked him what he meant, and he pointed to the computer, showing I had been gone for an hour and seven minutes. I don't remember delivering the pizza, only turning into the store when I was returning. 20 years later, I still have no idea what happened. Three. I had a dream of some kid that I had never seen before, dancing at a busy party. He was wearing a blue shirt, black pants, had Bieber hair, and there was a purple strobe light on the wall behind him. Wake up, think to myself, huh, what an odd dream, and carry on with my life. Several years later, I was at my cousin's wedding reception, chilling and hanging out with a different cousin. Music comes on and we start jumping up and down. And then I realized that I was reliving the dream. Same clothes, same hair, same purple lighting in the background. 4 A few months before my first car accident, I dreamed about it happening. Everything from the sounds to the placement and the smell was the same. The thing is, The girl driving tried to get me to find a different ride because she didn't want to do any extra driving that day. And after the crash I told her about my dream and she said she had the same one the night before and that's why she didn't want to drive. Freaky. 5 I once was woke up by a phone call from my GF. At the time she was at her friend's house, which I didn't know about until the phone call. We figured out our plans for the day. Told her that I was gonna lay around for 15 minutes to wake up a bit. I'd have a shower and head over to get her. I just laid down, started to fall asleep. Then the phone rang about 15 minutes after the last phone call. It was her calling from her friend's house again. Convo was the same word for word, so I played along. Then when it was done, she was wondering why I was laughing. I told her we just had this convo 15 minutes ago. She disagreed and I figured was pulling my leg. Later that day I checked my calls, only had one from that number. And she showed me her friend's phone. Same, only one call made. 6 I knew someone that fell asleep drunk on a three story flat roof which they rolled off of during the night. The doctors said the main reason he didn't break anything was that his Body was in such a state of relaxation from the booze induced coma he was in that he pretty much just bounced off the concrete.

One, at my job recently, a woman claimed I had promised her something for free when in fact all I did was offer her a significant discount. She came in demanding it for free and I refused. She said she had a recording of me saying it was free. I don't know what her endgame was, but on the off chance I had messed up what I said badly enough, I would honor it, I asked her to play me the recording. She refused because I was being difficult. She actually had the nerve to ask for my boss's number so she could complain about me not honoring a product for free valued at around $400 and thought they would actually side with her. 2. I created a binder for a hotel my company owns with forms and templates. I highlighted and wrote explanations on everything. About a month later, I go to the property to assist with some things and the GM brings out the binder and says, yeah, I just put this together as a tool for us here. I immediately tell him, no, you didn't. I made that and gave it to you. His face went white as he tried to recover saying, well, I added a few things. He didn't love the faces of my colleagues when I went back to the office and told them all three. When I worked at a fast food place, I Had someone call in during the opening shift while we were still prepping everything for the day. He tells me he was just there and that the service was terrible and his order was wrong. I asked him when exactly he came in. He said about half an hour ago. I said, oh, that's weird because we don't even open for another 45 minutes. He just hung up without a word. 4, my ex wife told my kids I didn't pay child support regularly. I was able to lay out each and every receipt for three years showing each payment made on time or early. But I wouldn't say triumphant. There are no winners in divorce. 5, my friend's favorite is from when working at Mickey D's. She was on drive drive through and a guy came through complaining about the ice cream he got earlier. That's when everyone who worked there came to the drive through window to see. Friend casually lets them know they haven't had a working ice cream machine in four months. Six, at an auto shop, angry customer ahead of me was shouting, we've been here more than two hours. The shop manager gets out a piece of paper. We printed the work order you signed less than 30 minutes ago. Seven, I was waiting at a red light behind a red BMW. I saw that its bumper was kind of messed up. The light turns green and he starts going and I slowly accelerate. Like any normal human. Then he slams on his brakes and I do the same. Don't hit him at all. He reverses into my car and turns on his hazards and pulls into the shopping complex near us. We exchange information. I am absolutely calm. Later at small claims court after rejecting his claim with my insurance, he goes, yes, your honour, this rear ending left me with 5,000 in damage including paint and 1 thousand in emotional distress as I have needed physical therapy. Judge looks at me and you say you have video of this incident. Me. Yes, I do, sir. And I hand the CD to the bailiff. The dash cam clearly shows his fraud. Judge, so is that you in the video? Him. Um, he literally got arrested and had to pay me 5,000 in damages. Get a dash cam, people. 8. I had a customer once call and say she had bought these ice cream sandwiches the week before and they were all freezer burned. She was super aggressive and was yelling. So I very politely confirmed the exact product she bought. She yelled, yes, that one. That's what I've been telling you. And I said, miss, we discontinued those six months ago. She stuttered a bit and hung up. I was 19. It was my first job and it was so satisfying.

One, when he was little, my younger son wouldn't try and wake you up if he needed something. He'd do that creepy thing kids do where they just stand there looking at you until you wake up. Well, I wake up at about 1:00am in a dark bedroom and see the black silhouette of a young kid standing right next to the bed. Golly, that's scary. Then he asked, hey, dad, Wanna play Rock Band 2? Waking up to my husband yelling, get out of my house. A man broke into my house and crawled in bed with me. Turns out he was in the house for a couple of hours. According to my door camera, my husband was asleep on the couch, came to bed and found the guy on the bed beside me asleep. Also, I accidentally left my door unlocked when I lived in this studio apartment in Philly. I woke up and it felt like someone was watching me. You know that feeling. Then I heard a shuffling noise and turn the lights on. There was a guy in a hoodie standing at the foot of my bed. I screamed. It was a young drunk dude that I literally had to push out. He seemed confused, but I'll never know what his intent was. I've never left my door unlocked since 3. Once I woke up to go to the bathroom, got up, smack something, slap me in The face. Turns out it was my entire right arm. Completely numb. Nearly scared the piss out of me and concerned me greatly afterwards. Has not happened since. 4. Back when I lived alone in an apartment, I used to wake up to just about anything. Never woke up more terrified than the night when I woke up to the sound of my toilet flushing. To this day, I can only assume that a ghost just couldn't hold it anymore. Five, I woke up and my dad's alarm clock was going off through the wall. He was a really light sleeper and he always turned it off immediately. It had been going off for several minutes and I think I knew before I got to his room that he was no longer with me. It was just so incredibly out of character for that alarm to be going off like that. He went in his sleep with a blanket still completely undisturbed. And I think I felt some small comfort at that, even though I was just a kid. 6, I once woke up to an earthquake at 4:00am. I lived in a house over the ocean on stilts, so my house was rocking like crazy. It was my first earthquake. And for some reason my brain first thought that someone was robbing me. I grabbed a machete and ran outside shirtless in my underwear. Neighbors next to me looked at me alarmed and started laughing. 7, my partner waking. Me up during a camping trip. He woke me to gather all our gear and our dogs into our truck ASAP. Lightning we had spotted six hours earlier in the day had sparked a wildfire. We got out as ash and sparks were falling around us. When we reached the top of the ridge surrounding our camp, we got out to look and watch the fire eat our entire campsite. We're so glad we called in the strike when we saw it. We met fire crews on our way out. The fire burned for like a week. One of the fires in Oregon in 2020, the Lakeview Paisley Fire 8, a bed bug infestation. I had had them for weeks and had no idea what they were. I would see one or two here or there and I'd just squash them, wonder what they were and move on. One morning, I woke up early and found quite a few of them on my bed. I started looking more closely and realised that the creases of the mattress were infested with them. Then I started to do some research, Learned that I had bed bugs, felt my soul leave my body, then began the process of getting rid of them. They're a psychological horror experience I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy. Five years after the fact, and I still get paranoia attacks at a random speck in the sheets or mysterious red marks in the morning.

What did you do in 9th grade? I got the teacher everybody wanted for biology. Except one morning our entire class could hear her outside the room getting chewed out by our assistant principal for being late on grading. We also knew she had lost her sister the week before, so she was having a really rough time. A few minutes into teaching, she started explaining something about our final exam and the guys next to me were passing notes. They usually did it every time she turned around, but this time she saw them. She usually wouldn't have cared, but she thought it was something about her. So she walked over and asked to see it. Kid shook his head without saying anything. So she basically reached into his pocket to grab the note. She started reading it in front of the class and said, I left it in the garbage bin in room W12. It's all there with the. And stopped herself before reading the rest out loud. She looked down at the boy, clearly having read something bad and didn't know what to say. Her face was pale and not knowing what to do. She grabbed them both and literally yanked them out of the room. We all sat there confused for a half hour wondering what that note said. There were police at our school and they asked our whole route to come to the office. They questioned everybody about It, but nobody knew anything. And by the time they let us go, they had sent everybody home. We later found out that the note said there was a key to the office in that garbage bin along with a loaded gun. Both of them denied writing it and said they didn't know who it was for. So they decided to fire our teacher for creating a school wide panic and expelled our entire row.

When I was in ninth grade, I got stuck with our school's worst teacher, who was infamous for trying to make a Muslim girl take off her headwear to prove she wasn't wearing headphones in class. There were a lot of students who got away with cheating by wearing headphones during tests, so she was constantly checking. Since then, she didn't do anything too bad until we had to take our final exam at the end of the year, and she stood up to walk around the room. It was really hot that day, so I wore a lighter shirt. I also happened to have type 1 diabetes, so you could see my insulin pump. That day, my blood sugar was low, so I turned my pump on and walked into class. We were almost done taking the test, and she stood up to walk around the room. I was honestly focused on just passing until I heard her walk straight up behind me. In that moment, two things happened. She grabbed my paper off my desk and told me I failed, and I felt her grab the pump on my waist. I just sat there in shock as she walked away and had no idea what had just happened. However, it wasn't until I noticed she was holding Scissors that it clicked what she had just done. She seen the wire hanging off My waist and assumed I had headphones in. When I looked down, the tube was cut. After a few seconds, my pump started beeping very loudly and everyone started looking at me. A few people sitting around me saw what happened and were in shock. She came over and when she realized what she did, I watched her face turn pale. She had messed up big time and had no idea what to do, and neither did I. She told me to go to the nurse, and on the way there, I started getting. I made it there. Could feel myself starting to pass out. The nurse called 9 1 1 and I had to go to the hospital. But since that day, I actually started wearing headphones in class because none of the teachers would try anything.

It started at Thanksgiving when my cousin wouldn't shut up about me being single. She kept asking why I never brought anyone home, making these fake concerned faces at the dinner table. So when she said, I must be dating someone special, I just nodded, gave him a name right on the spot. Daniel said he was busy with work. My family ate it up. But then Christmas rolled around and my mom started asking when she could meet Daniel. My aunt kept texting about setting an extra place at dinner. I was stuck. That's when my roommate Becca suggested her coworker, Daniel, who owed her big time for covering his shifts. She showed me his Instagram, tall brown hair, actually decent looking. He agreed to one dinner as a favor. The problem, he didn't just show up and fake smile through dinner. He brought flowers for my mom, asked my dad about his woodworking hobby and somehow knew my grandmother collected vintage tea cups because I'd mentioned it once when building the fake story. He even laughed at my little brother's terrible jokes about robots. My family was obsessed. After that first dinner, my mom kept inviting him back, Easter brunch, my cousin's graduation party, random Sunday dinners. Daniel never said no. He text me beforehand asking what to bring, if anyone had allergies, stuff like that. He started sending my brother updates about basketball. Scores. My dad asked him to help fix our back porch. The worst part was how natural it felt. We drive to my parents house together and he'd ask about my day like we actually dated. He remembered my coffee order, knew I hated mushrooms, grab my jacket when I got cold. During family game night, he'd automatically pick me as his partner. We had inside jokes that weren't even planned. One night after my aunt's birthday party, we sat in his car outside my apartment in complete silence. Everyone had spent the whole night saying how perfect we looked together, how lucky I was. My grandmother even pulled me aside to say Daniel was a keeper. The whole car ride home, I kept stealing glances at him, wondering what he was thinking. I started rehearsing speeches in my bathroom mirror, practice bringing it up casually over coffee. But every time I opened my mouth, nothing came out. How do you tell someone you caught feelings for a fake relationship? Everything changed at Christmas dinner. My aunt announced she'd been looking at wedding venues for us. She found the perfect place for next fall. Daniel laughed it off perfectly, made some joke about her getting ahead of herself. But later that night, he texted me, we can't keep this up forever. You know, that message hit me like a truck. I realized he was ready to end this whole thing and I wasn't, not even close. Instead of texting back, Or giving him some weird speech. I invited him over for dinner at my place, cooked his favorite pasta dish, the one my mom always made when he came over, set the table with actual candles, not just the overhead light. After we finished eating, I was washing dishes and he was drying them, just like we did at my parents house. That's when I finally said it. I know this whole thing started as pretend, but it doesn't feel fake.

So when she said, I must be dating someone special, I just nodded, gave him a name right on the spot. Daniel said he was busy with work. My family ate it up. But then Christmas rolled around and my mom started asking when she could meet Daniel. My aunt kept texting about setting an extra place at dinner. I was stuck. That's when my roommate Becca suggested her coworker, Daniel, who owed her big time for covering his shifts. She showed me his Instagram, tall brown hair, actually decent looking. He agreed to one dinner as a favor. The problem, he didn't just show up and fake smile through dinner. He brought flowers for my mom, asked my dad about his woodworking hobby and somehow knew my grandmother collected vintage tea cups because I'd mentioned it once when building the fake story. He even laughed at my little brother's terrible jokes about robots. My family was obsessed. After that first dinner, my mom kept inviting him back, Easter brunch, my cousin's graduation party, random Sunday dinners. Daniel never said no. He text me beforehand asking what to bring, if anyone had allergies, stuff like that. He started sending my brother updates about basketball. Scores. My dad asked him to help fix our back porch. The worst part was how natural it felt. We drive to my parents house together and he'd ask about my day like we actually dated. He remembered my coffee order, knew I hated mushrooms, grab my jacket when I got cold. During family game night, he'd automatically pick me as his partner. We had inside jokes that weren't even planned. One night after my aunt's birthday party, we sat in his car outside my apartment in complete silence. Everyone had spent the whole night saying how perfect we looked together, how lucky I was. My grandmother even pulled me aside to say Daniel was a keeper. The whole car ride home, I kept stealing glances at him, wondering what he was thinking. I started rehearsing speeches in my bathroom mirror, practice bringing it up casually over coffee. But every time I opened my mouth, nothing came out. How do you tell someone you caught feelings for a fake relationship? Everything changed at Christmas dinner. My aunt announced she'd been looking at wedding venues for us. She found the perfect place for next fall. Daniel laughed it off perfectly, made some joke about her getting ahead of herself. But later that night, he texted me, we can't keep this up forever. You know, that message hit me like a truck. I realized he was ready to end this whole thing and I wasn't, not even close. Instead of texting back, Or giving him some weird speech. I invited him over for dinner at my place, cooked his favorite pasta dish, the one my mom always made when he came over, set the table with actual candles, not just the overhead light. After we finished eating, I was washing dishes and he was drying them, just like we did at my parents house. That's when I finally said it. I know this whole thing started as pretend, but it doesn't feel fake.

She returned 6 years later to find I'd divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2 3 years, max. Change the locks. She left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation. To our eight year olds, that first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home, and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decision. It's no more walking on eggshells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curveball. Our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year two brought unexpected changes. Without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I've been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd forgotten how to enjoy My children. Year three changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partner ship could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually, she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her bonus mom. Their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes, and tucked them in at night. Year five was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and be being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year six, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward. After three Years of zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from the living room. Through the window, we watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she own

It started when my sister Chloe came home crying because her boyfriend Jake dumped her. She's 25 and I'm 17, but she always acts like she's the victim in every situation. This time was different, though. She kept saying Jake was horrible and cruel. But when I asked what happened, she got all shifty. He said he broke up with her out of nowhere and kicked her out of his apartment. But then she mentioned she still had keys to his place because she forgot to give them back the next day. She left early in the morning and came back with this huge golden retriever. I recognized him immediately. It was Buster, Jake's dog. Jake love that dog more than anything. When his grandpa died last year, Buster was the only thing that helped him through it. I asked Chloe why she had Buster and she got this weird smile on her face. She said Jake didn't deserve to keep him since he broke her heart. Then she said something that made my stomach drop. She told me she was going to take Buster to the vet tomorrow to put him down as payback for what Jake did to her. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. This dog was completely healthy and happy, just confused about being in a new place. Buster kept looking around for Jake and whining by the door. It was heartbreaking. I told Chloe she was being insane and she couldn't just kill someone's dog because she was upset. She laughed and said Jake should have thought about that before he decided to hurt her. Then she said if I told anyone, she'd make sure I regretted it. That night I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about Buster and how scared he must be. Around 2:00am, I heard Chloe on the phone with someone probably making the vet appointment. I knew I had to do something. Then next morning, Chloe left for work and told mom she was taking Buster for a walk later. Mom didn't know the whole story. Chloe just said Jake asked her to watch his dog for a few days. As soon as both then were gone, I called Jake. He picked up on the first ring and sounded terrible. I told him Chloe had Buster and was planning to put him down today. He went completely silent for like 10 seconds, then started freaking out. He said he'd been looking everywhere for Buster and thought maybe he got out somehow. I told Jake to come over now while Chloe was at work. He was at our house in 15 minutes. When he saw Buster, he literally started crying. Buster went crazy with excitement, jumping all over him and licking his face. I opened the door and Jake carried his dog out to his car. Before he left, Jake told me what really happened with Chloe. She Didn't just get dumped. She cheated on him with his best friend, Marcus. When Jake found out, he broke up with her and told her to move out. She stole Buster on her way out and left Jake's spare key on the counter so he thought she was being mature about the breakup. A few hours later, Chloe came home and went straight to look for Buster when she couldn't find him. She started screaming my name. She found me in my room and absolutely lost it. She called me a traitor and said I had no right to interfere in her business. Then mom came home and asked what all the yelling was about. Chloe told her I let some guy steal her dog. She made it sound like I just gave away her pet to a random stranger. Mom looked.

They didn't even host it, but they still say, oh my God, our party was so fun. They're not even popular. Everyone is just scared of them.

Popular girls are like NPCs with main character syndrome. Total idiots, loud and everywhere. Follow for more daily rants.

My 82 year old grandma Dorothy discovered Amazon Prime last month. This woman who still doesn't trust ATMs and hides cash in cookie tins somehow figured out one click ordering. It started innocently. My cousin set up her account so she could order sunflower seeds for the cardinals in her yard. First delivery, 40 pounds of bird seed. Perfect. Second delivery, 80 pounds of bird seed just in case. Third delivery, an inflatable hot tub. Grandma, why did you buy a hot tub? I didn't buy hot tub. I just pushed button. But since it's here, she set it up in her small backyard. Soon her neighbors, Mrs. Johnson, Mrs. Miller and Mrs. Green, all in their 70s, started coming over for joint therapy sessions. They sit in the hot tub fully clothed because as grandma says, bikinis are for teenagers. Fourth delivery, a karaoke machine for hot tub nights. Now every Thursday evening, four elderly women sit in a hot tub belting out Elvis and Dolly Parton songs at top volume. Fifth delivery, 120 cans of Vienna sausages. It was bargain such deal. Grandma, you don't even like Vienna sausages but raccoons do. She's now feeding every raccoon in the county. Premium sausages. 6 delivery, a drone. Why do you need a drone? To spy on squirrels from kitchen she flew at once. It's now stuck in Mr Johnson's oak tree. He's convinced it's government surveillance and sprays it with The garden hose every morning. Seventh delivery. A 70 inch TV. Old TV. Too small. Grandma, your old TV was 60 inches. Yes, too small. Hard to see Judge Judy. She watches Judge Judy at volume 90 and yells advice at the screen like she's a co judge. The breaking point was delivery number eight. Motorcycle helmet. Grandma, you don't have a motorcycle? Not yet. Not yet. That's when I checked her Amazon cart. She had a Harley Davidson saved for later. I changed her password immediately. Why ruin my fun? Because you almost bought a motorcycle. It had good reviews. Now she has to call me Lana to order anything. But she found a loophole. She Learned Instacart. Last week, 50 watermelons showed up at her door. They sell by watermelon, not by pound. Deal of lifetime. She handed out watermelons to neighbors, delivery guys, even the UPS driver. Our street looks like a farmers market. Yesterday she called Lana. What's cryptocurrency? Why? Man on Facebook says I can turn watermelons into Bitcoin. Grandma, no, but he wears suit and picture looks smart. I rushed over. She was about to invest in something called Agricoin. Grandma, it's a scam, he said. I'm genius investor called me Warren Buffett of Ohio. She pouted then perked up. Lana, while you're here, help me set up TikTok. Mrs. Miller says. I could be influencer. Her username is now at hot tub grandma. 82. She has 20,000 followers in three weeks. Her top Video feeding Vienna sausages to raccoons while singing Dolly Parton. Comments are all. Protect this woman at all costs. She reads every comment through giant reading glasses and replies, bless your heart.

Every Thursday for three years, I told my wife Becca the same thing. I'm going to hang with the boys tonight, be back around midnight. Truth is, I was driving to the cinema to watch movies alone because I just needed some me time. But then two months ago, my movie ended abruptly and I came home two hours earlier than planned. When I turned onto our street, there was a black infinity in our driveway. My heart stopped as I watched back all the footage from our doorbell camera and saw a man getting out of the car and walk hang up like he done it before. Becca opened, before he could ring, they kissed the kind where her hand went to his neck. My stomach dropped. I wanted to burst through that door and confront them, but I decided on the spot that that would be too kind. I need did to do something else, something that would destroy her. So I drove around until 12:30 and walked in with a story about Tony getting drunk. Becca was showering. Hey, babe, how was your night? Good. You know how it is. Then next two Thursdays, I kept my routine but park down the street at 8:30 to watch. At the same time, the same car pulled up. I zoomed in on the ring footage and that's when it hit me. The man was Mark. Mark who supposedly moved to Seattle. Two years ago, my knees were shaking, but I took screenshots and sent them to my lawyer to further build my case. When I was confident enough that I had everything basically set up, I dropped a bomb. Becca was going on about her fake plans for when I left for boys night when I randomly blurted out, you know who I miss? Mark. That guy and I used to have so much fun before he moved to Seattle. Her fork stopped halfway to her mouth just for a second. Yeah, Mark was great. You guys still text though, right? Sometimes. The next morning she woke up different with this nervous energy. She made some phone calls behind closed doors. And since it was Thursday during lunch, she texted, what time are you heading out tonight? She never asked before, so I knew the comment about Mark got her probably 7:30. Why? Just wondering. The guys doing anything special? Same old after work. She was cooking in full makeup. You look nice, I said. Just felt like making an effort for you to come home to. But she kept checking her phone and setting it down, then pick getting it back up at 7:15. She practically pushed me out. Don't want you to be late. Tell everyone I say hi. I drove to my regular spot down the street where I watched them, but this time there was no car that showed up. And at 9:15, Becca's own car pulled Out I followed her. First stop, O'malley Sports Bar, where she thought I'd be. She walked in confidently, then came out five minutes later looking confused, checking her phone, scanning the parking lot. Then she got back in her car. Her second stop, the dugout, another sports bar. Through the windows, I watched her walk the entire place, moving table to table, even checking the bathroom entrance area. She showed her phone to a waitress who shrugged. Back to the car, more frantic phone checking. Third stop, Buffalo Wild Wings. She stayed longer, this time, 15 minutes. I could see her at the bar talking to the manager, showing him something on her phone, probably my pic. He shook his head, pointed to their mostly empty tables. Thursday wasn't exactly prime sports bar night. Fourth stop, the dive bar where Tony actually used to drag us. She went straight to the bartender. I slipped in through the side door, ducked into the hallway by the bathrooms, heard her say every Thursday night, group of guys, probably five or six of them loud. One of them looks like this. The bartender studied her phone. Thursday's our slowest night. I definitely remember a regular group. Sorry. She left looking frustrated, sat in her car for five minutes typing furiously. Then she drove to the a m. C theater. I gave her a 10 minute head start, then walked in through the side entrance. She was at the concession stand talking to the Teenage manager showed her phone again. He pointed toward the theaters. She went to check each one. Open doors, scanning the sparse Thursday night crowds. I went back to my car. 20 minutes later, she emerged looking defeated, sat in her car for another 10 minutes. Through her rear window, I could see her on the phone gesturing with her free hand, probably calling Mark, probably saying she couldn't find me anywhere. That maybe I knew that Thursday nights might not be safe anymore. She even drove by two more bars on the way home. Quick stops, desperate checks. When I got home at my U full time, she was on the couch with wine, trying to look casual, but her leg was bouncing. How was your night? Studying my face. Good. Same as always. Yeah. Where exactly did you guys go? Oh, Malley's. Why? Her jaw clenched. No reason. Just curious. Was it busy? Pretty dead, actually. Who all was there? Haven't heard their names in a while. The usual.

She gave us 12,000 for the roof last year, no questions asked. My stomach dropped. There was no roof repair. I'd seen the receipts myself. They'd used my money for Landon's gambling debts. How much this time? Mom asked. 50,000, Landon said casually, maybe 60 if we play it right. Tell her the cancer came back. Cancer? They were going to fake cancer to steal from me. I backed away slowly, my mind racing. The cancer scare from two years ago, the one that made me liquidate my retirement fund to pay for experimental. Had that been fake, too? I thought about all the times I'd helped. A car accident that wasn't covered by insurance. Landon's business that needed startup capital. Mom's dental work, Dad's back surgery. $57,000 over five years. All because I thought I was being a good daughter. Every family gathering, they raised me for being so generous. Behind my back, they were laughing at how easy I was to manipulate. I got in my Car and drove straight to the bank. I'd like to close all my accounts, I told the teller. All of them. Miss every single one. And I need cashiers checks for the full amount. documentation of every transaction I've made to these three people over the past five years. That evening, Landon called, right on schedule. Hey, sis, can you come over tomorrow? Mom has some news about her health. His voice had that practiced concern, the same tone he'd used for every fake emergency. Sure, I said sweetly. I'll bring the whole family something special. I spent that night making copies of everything. Bank statements, medical records I'd helped to pay for. Receipts from Landon's failed ventures. Five years of financial manipulation, all documented. The next day, I

Logan had been complaining for weeks that I hovered too much. When we went out at his company's holiday party, he pulled me aside near the coat check. Listen. Tonight, can you just not be so attached to me? My coworkers think it's weird how you're always by my side. Just mingle on your own. For once, I smiled sweetly. Of course, babe, I'll give you tons of space. Really? You're not upset? Not at all. You want independence at parties? You got it. The party was at this upscale rooftop venue, open bar, DJ, the Works. Logan immediately ditched me to bro out with his work buddies, leaving me by the entrance. Perfect. I walked straight to the bar where his boss, Thomas, was getting drinks. Emily, where's Logan? Oh, he wanted space. Tonight, I'm flying solo. Thomas looked confused at his own company party. He says I'm too clingy, didn't want me cramping his style. Thomas's wife, Diane overheard. He left you alone. How rude. No worries. I'll just entertain myself. And I did. I ended up in a fascinating conversation with the CFO about cryptocurrency. Then the head of HR pulled me into their group to settle a debate about true crime podcasts. I was having a genuinely great time. An hour in, I caught Logan's eye across the room. He was with his bros but kept glancing over As I laughed with his supervisors, then the DJ started playing salsa music. This gorgeous guy from accounting, Javier, asked if I could dance. I'd love to. We tore up that dance floor. Turns out Javier was a semi professional dancer. He spun me, dipped me the whole nine yards. Proud form to watch. Logan appeared suddenly. Hey, maybe we should, oh, am I being too clingy? I asked mid spin. No, I just, great. Then you won't mind if I keep dancing. Javier dipped me dramatically. The crowd cheered. Logan retreated to the bar Downing whiskey with his confused buddies. Later, the CEO's wife pulled me aside. You're Logan's girlfriend. We need to talk. She dragged me to her table full of executives wives. They immediately adopted me, pouring champagne and gossiping about everyone. Logan usually brags about you non stop. One said, where is he? He needed guy time. Apparently I hover. They exchanged looks. Men are idiots, the CEO's wife declared, raising her glass. Toasted to that. Logan kept trying to approach, but every time he got close, someone else would pull me into conversation. His female co workers wanted workout tips. The it guys needed restaurant recommendations. Even the janitor asked for relationship advice. Everyone loved me except Logan who looked increasingly miserable. Then came the speeches. CEO grabbed the mic thanking everyone for their hard work. Special shout out to Emily for bringing such amazing energy tonight. Logan, you're a lucky man. Everyone clapped looking Around for Logan. He was sulking by the bathroom. Where's Logan? The CEO asked into the mic. He wanted space. So when yelled laughter erupted, the CEO's wife grabbed the mic. Well, his loss. Emily's been the life of the party. More cheering. Logan's face went red. Around midnight, the party was winding down. I was.

She returned 6 years later to find I divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years Max. Change the locks. She left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation to our 8 year olds. That first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decision missions. No more walking on eggshells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curve ball our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year 2 brought unexpected changes without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I've been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd forgotten how to Enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partner ship could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught sky to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her Bonus Mom, their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes and tucked them in at night. Year 5 was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. Their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year 6, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward after three years. Of zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp in the living room. Through the window, we watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck, pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she owned the place. Eleanor was packing the twins lunches for.

Ask around. Nobody has ever. Three, raw eggs are mostly fine for you. It's not impossible, but you're highly unlikely to get salmonella from eating them. The reason you shouldn't eat raw cookie dough is the raw flour, which is actually dangerous, not the raw eggs. Four, paper wasps. They're incredibly docile. Every year they build a nest above my back door. Even if there's dozens of them swarming around, they won't bother you if you don't bother them. They're fascinating creatures to observe. You can actually feed them by hand by dipping your finger in syrup, honey or anything sugary. They'll lick it right off. Five years of coexisting with them and I have yet to get stung. Plus, having their nest over the door deters burglars. 5, nuclear power, the safest energy source humanity has ever known. Fun nuclear fact, if you swam near the surface of a nuclear containment pool with actual glowing radioactive spent fuel rods in the bottom, you would receive less radiation than if you just stood out in the sun. 6, not that I would know, but apparently and scientifically, taking LSD in a reasonable dose and many other psychedelics, it is almost no risk for physical or mental addiction harm, according to Medical and psychological studies. On the other hand, there are a lot of potential benefits regarding mental health, especially if you compare it with legal stuff like cigarettes or alcohol, which are both one of the most harmful substances in existence. But most people think psychedelics are on the same level as real hard stuff such as meth or heroin just because they only classify in legal and illegal. This is no advice, just my opinion based on a ton of research. 7, eating food that's a bit past the sell by date. 8, msg. And it's so good. Put that on your eggs.

What is wrong with September? It's only been 11 days and the world is completely off its fucking rocker. Charlie Kirk was killed in front of his family. David was found with a body in his car. A Ukrainian girl was stabbed on the subway. And now Elon Musk isn't even the richest man on the planet anymore. Like, can we chill for one second? First, Charlie Kirk got shot during a speech in Utah. He was literally in front of his wife and kids when a bullet entered his artery through his neck. The scene was so bloody and gruesome, it's insane. A Ukrainian girl gets stabbed on a train in Charlotte. She escaped a literal war, came here to be safe and still got killed because this planet has zero peace. Then D4D has a whole body in his car, like not a metaphorical one, an actual human body in a bag in his trunk. And this dude just casually performed like he didn't have a horror movie in his backseat. What the hell? And even outside all of that, Elon Musk is no longer the richest person in the world, losing his top spot to a rival tech CEO, showing how unstable everything feels right now, even at the highest levels. It's like every time I open my phone, reality speed runs another tragedy. Like, bro, it's been 11 days. September just started. I thought my only problem this month would be math class, but no, apparently It's full blown world collapse. Society isn't just cooked, it's burnt to ash.

I was halfway through Saturday morning spin at Cycle Soul Clenching to keep my tampon inside of me when I noticed the blonde girl in front of me facetiming my boyfriend of four years. Can't wait to see you tonight, beautiful, he whispered. I vomited in my mouth. I can't believe we've been dating for three months already. She responded like, hello, Britney. Our instructor who always wore the cutest sets saw me crying and immediately cut her playlist. Hey, hon, are you doing okay? That's my man. I pointed at the screen where Blake was now shirtless making breakfast. The entire studio went silent, 25 girls in coordinating workout sets just staring. The blonde girl immediately hung up and turned around. Wait, girl, I'm so sorry. I swear I didn't know. Every single girl started climbing off their bikes. Someone handed me a liquid IV. Someone else had tissues, the good ones with lotion. Another girl was already fixing my mascara with her emergency makeup kit. Four years, Natalie shrieked. This absolute trash man has been with her for four years. The blonde Isabella looked like she was gonna throw up her green juice. I met him on Bumble and he said he just got out of something casual. Casual. The entire room erupted. They found his Instagram and followed in seconds. The most recent photo was literally a picture of us holding hands by the beach with the caption L O m L this absolute queen with sleeve tattoos and perfect and liner just said call his sister speaker now my hands were shaking as I found Ellie's contact. She spoke first hey babe how's been? Did you try that new protein smoothie place? After Ellie my voice voice cracked Blake's facetiming another girl they've been together for three months the silence was louder than when a boy starts showing you his camera roll on the first date girl, don't play are you being effing for real right now? I turned on Facetime and showed myself crying my eyes out and that's when she started shouting I'm getting my mom and we're coming right now don't effing move she hung up and I just stared at my phone like okay, Ellie kind of ate oh, this is about to be good someone whispered Isabella and I were clutching each other's hands neither of us blaming each other the entire class was hyping me up and telling me I deserve better teenager in the corner came up to me and said girl even while crying your skin is glowing let that crusty man go back to picking girls who are actually in his league the class leader Bethany shouted your hot girl era starts now now even the quiet girl said girl you were really gonna give that receding hairline your best years that one made me laugh and y'all when that door flew open it was like Real Housewives Met Crazy Rich Asians. Ellie strutted in with her Balenciaga bag. Mrs. A. Leek in her Saturday costar fit but make it fashion. Her Aunt Linda, who I didn't even know was coming, had her Cartier sunglasses on indoors. Where is she? Mrs. Leek's voice could have cut diamonds. She saw me, saw Isabella. I watched her perfectly microbladed brows go through the five stages of grief in real time. Ellie, call your brother now, mom. Maybe we should now. The way Ellie's acrylics clicked on her phone screen was aggressive. What? Blake's annoyed voice came through the speaker. Get your butt down to cycle soul.

So I did exactly that and watched her world crumble. She watched me get down on one knee five times and said no every single time. Eight years together, I've been playing husband since year two, paying her car note, keeping her on my insurance, covering most of the rent while she found herself through three different careers. She had this whole routine down, tears in her eyes, hand on her heart, then some perfectly rehearsed excuse, we're not ready. Let's wait till we're more stable. Timing isn't right. Then came proposal No. 5, and she finally showed me who she really was. I'd gone all out this time, convinced myself that maybe the problem was I hadn't made it special enough. I rented out her favorite restaurants, rooftop, hung string lights everywhere and invited all our friends and family there. The whole production cost me three months salary, but I thought it'd be worth it when she finally said yes. My girlfriend stood there in the dress I'd bought her, surrounded by everyone we knew, and she didn't even let me finish the speech, just shook her head with this pitying smile like I was a dog that wouldn't stop bringing her the same stick. Back at our apartment that night, I finally broke, asked her straight up if she loved me. Why did she keep doing this? Her whole face changed in an instant and the mask came. Completely off. It's my choice when I accept a proposal, she said. Voice ice cold. You don't get to pressure me with your timeline. You're my boyfriend, so act like one. Stop trying to be my husband when I haven't even accepted your proposal. Know your place. No, my place. After eight years of building a life together, I was supposed to know my place. Those words rewired something in my brain. Eight years of playing husband while she kept me a boyfriend status because it was convenient for her. She wanted me to act like a boyfriend. Fine. I give her exactly what she asked for. But boyfriends don't pay their girlfriends bills. Boyfriends don't share bank accounts. Boyfriends don't sacrifice their futures for someone who won't even wear their ring. I started my new boyfriend only poly see the next morning while she was at her yoga class. First, I sold the ring to a dealer for 12 grand, enough to cover what I spent on her car this year alone. Then I called Verizon and removed her from my phone plan. By the time she got home from yoga, I changed every password and moved my money from our joint account. She didn't even notice until lunch when her phone died mid phone call. Babe, my phone's not working, she texted from her laptop, annoyed but not worried. Call Verizon. It's being weird. An hour later, they said I'm not on the account anymore. Then the panic. Started creeping in. What did you do? I responded, I'm being your boyfriend and not your husband, just like you said. She actually laughed at first, thinking it was some kind of joke. She came home that night acting extra sweet. Made my favorite dinner and tried to cuddle on the couch. Okay, you made your point, she said. Kissing my neck. I'll think about what you said. Now fix my phone. I moved to the guest bedroom instead. The next morning, she couldn't log into Netflix. Then Hulu died.

When I turned 15, my mom went from strict to straight up paranoid. One night after dinner, she plopped down next to me with this weird smile and said she was installing a family safety app on my phone. I watched her tap away, giving herself access to everything. My location, photos, texts, even my drafts on social media. It's just to keep you safe, honey, she said, handing my phone back like nothing had changed. But everything had changed. It felt like having a stalker who lived in my house. At first I tried to be cool about it. Maybe it would calm her down, right? Wrong. Things got insane fast. She text me in the middle of conversations asking who I was with. Comment on memes I haven't even posted yet because she was reading my drafts. The worst part? She started replying to my friends pretending to be me. My buddy Jake texted asking if I wanted to hang out, and my mom replied, sure. Sure thing, buddy! With way too many exclamation points. Jake called me laughing, asking why I was texting like a soccer mom. I had no idea what he meant until I checked my messages. Then came the day that broke me. I was in history class when Mrs. Wilson pulled me aside. Looked uncomfortable as hell. Liam, your mother called the school. She's concerned about some message you sent about Me. My stomach dropped. I knew exactly what she meant. I texted my best friend Kyle the night before, joking about how our history teacher's haircut looked like she stuck her finger in an electrical socket. It was just good friend stuff, not meant for anyone else. But my mom had read it and called the school to complain about my private joke. I wanted to disappear into the floor. By lunch, Kyle wasn't talking to me. Neither was Jake. Word got around that my mom was reading everything, and suddenly nobody wanted to text me anymore. Some kids even blocked me. It was like my social life had a disease. And the disease was my mom. That night, I stared at my phone, feeling trapped. But then I noticed something. The tracking app worked both ways. It log every time someone access the account. I spent hours studying those logs, and what I found made my skin crawl. My mom wasn't just checking my phone during the day. She was logging in 1 a m, 2 a m, even 3 a m. She was forwarding my messages to her laptop. She was screenshotting my photos. She was living inside my phone 24 7. So I came up with a plan. I created a fake friend named Daniel, made up this whole persona, gave him a backstory. Even found some random photos online to use as his profile pic on a group chat with myself.

Logan had been complaining for weeks that I hovered too much. When we went out at his company's holiday party, he pulled me aside near the coat check. Listen. Tonight, can you just not be so attached to me? My coworkers think it's weird how you're always by my side. Just mingle on your own. For once, I smiled sweetly. Of course, babe, I'll give you tons of space. Really? You're not upset? Not at all. You want independence at parties? You got it. The party was at this upscale rooftop venue, open bar, DJ, the Works. Logan immediately ditched me to bro out with his work buddies, leaving me by the entrance. Perfect. I walked straight to the bar where his boss, Thomas, was getting drinks. Emily, where's Logan? Oh, he wanted space. Tonight, I'm flying solo. Thomas looked confused at his own company party. He says I'm too clingy, didn't want me cramping his style. Thomas's wife, Diane overheard. He left you alone. How rude. No worries. I'll just entertain myself. And I did. I ended up in a fascinating conversation with the CFO about cryptocurrency. Then the head of HR pulled me into their group to settle a debate about true crime podcasts. I was having a genuinely great time. An hour in, I caught Logan's eye across the room. He was with his bros but kept glancing over As I laughed with his supervisors, then the DJ started playing salsa music. This gorgeous guy from accounting, Javier, asked if I could dance. I'd love to. We tore up that dance floor. Turns out Javier was a semi professional dancer. He spun me, dipped me the whole nine yards. Proud form to watch. Logan appeared suddenly. Hey, maybe we should, oh, am I being too clingy? I asked mid spin. No, I just, great. Then you won't mind if I keep dancing. Javier dipped me dramatically. The crowd cheered. Logan retreated to the bar Downing whiskey with his confused buddies. Later, the CEO's wife pulled me aside. You're Logan's girlfriend. We need to talk. She dragged me to her table full of executives wives. They immediately adopted me, pouring champagne and gossiping about everyone. Logan usually brags about you non stop. One said, where is he? He needed guy time. Apparently I hover. They exchanged looks. Men are idiots, the CEO's wife declared, raising her glass. Toasted to that. Logan kept trying to approach, but every time he got close, someone else would pull me into conversation. His female co workers wanted workout tips. The it guys needed restaurant recommendations. Even the janitor asked for relationship advice. Everyone loved me except Logan who looked increasingly miserable. Then came the speeches. CEO grabbed the mic thanking everyone for their hard work. Special shout out to Emily for bringing such amazing energy tonight. Logan, you're a lucky man. Everyone clapped looking Around for Logan. He was sulking by the bathroom. Where's Logan? The CEO asked into the mic. He wanted space. So when yelled laughter erupted, the CEO's wife grabbed the mic. Well, his loss. Emily's been the life of the party. More cheering. Logan's face went red. Around midnight, the party was winding down. I was.

It started at Thanksgiving when my cousin wouldn't shut up about me being single. She kept asking why I never brought anyone home, making these fake concerned faces at the dinner table. So when she said, I must be dating someone special, I just nodded, gave him a name right on the spot. Daniel said he was busy with work. My family ate it up. But then Christmas rolled around and my mom started asking when she could meet Daniel. My aunt kept texting about setting an extra place at dinner. I was stuck. That's when my roommate Becca suggested her coworker, Daniel, who owed her big time for covering his shifts. She showed me his Instagram, tall brown hair, actually decent looking. He agreed to one dinner as a favor. The problem, he didn't just show up and fake smile through dinner. He brought flowers for my mom, asked my dad about his woodworking hobby and somehow knew my grandmother collected vintage tea cups because I'd mentioned it once when building the fake story. He even laughed at my little brother's terrible jokes about robots. My family was obsessed. After that first dinner, my mom kept inviting him back, Easter brunch, my cousin's graduation party, random Sunday dinners. Daniel never said no. He text me beforehand asking what to bring, if anyone had allergies, stuff like that. He started sending my brother updates about basketball. Scores. My dad asked him to help fix our back porch. The worst part was how natural it felt. We drive to my parents house together and he'd ask about my day like we actually dated. He remembered my coffee order, knew I hated mushrooms, would grab my jacket when I got cold. During family game night, he'd automatically pick me as his partner. We had inside jokes that weren't even planned. One night after my aunt's birthday party, we sat in his car outside my apartment in complete silence. Everyone had spent the whole night saying how perfect we looked together, how lucky I was. My grandmother even pulled me aside to say Daniel was a keeper. Whole car ride home, I kept stealing glances at him, wondering what he was thinking. I started rehearsing speeches in my bathroom mirror, practice bringing it up casually over coffee. But every time I opened my mouth, nothing came out. How do you tell someone you caught feelings for a fake relationship? Everything changed at Christmas dinner. My aunt announced she'd been looking at wedding venues for us and she found the perfect place for next fall. Daniel laughed it off perfectly, made some joke about her getting ahead of herself. But later that night, he texted me, we can't keep this up forever. You know, that message hit me like a truck. I realized he was ready to end this whole thing and I wasn't, not even close. Instead of texting Back or giving him some weird speech. I invited him over for dinner at my place, cooked his favorite pasta dish, the one my mom always made when he came over, set the table with actual candles, not just the overhead light. After we finished eating, I was washing dishes and he was drying them, just like we did at my parents house. That's when I finally said it. I know this.

So I did exactly that and watched her world crumble. She watched me get down on one knee five times and said no every single time. Eight years together, I've been playing husband since year two, paying her car note, keeping her on my insurance, covering most of the rent while she found herself through three different careers. She had this whole routine down, tears in her eyes, hand on her heart, then some perfectly rehearsed excuse, we're not ready. Let's wait till we're more stable. Timing isn't right. Then came proposal No. 5, and she finally showed me who she really was. I'd gone all out this time, convinced myself that maybe the problem was I hadn't made it special enough. I rented out her favorite restaurants, rooftop, hung string lights everywhere and invited all our friends and family there. The whole production cost me three months salary, but I thought it'd be worth it when she finally said yes. My girlfriend stood there in the dress I'd bought her, surrounded by everyone we knew, and she didn't even let me finish the speech, just shook her head with this pitying smile like I was a dog that wouldn't stop bringing her the same stick. Back at our apartment that night, I finally broke, asked her straight up if she loved me. Why did she keep doing this? Her whole face changed in an instant and the mask came. Completely off. It's my choice when I accept a proposal, she said. Voice ice cold. You don't get to pressure me with your timeline. You're my boyfriend, so act like one. Stop trying to be my husband when I haven't even accepted your proposal. Know your place. No, my place. After eight years of building a life together, I was supposed to know my place. Those words rewired something in my brain. Eight years of playing husband while she kept me a boyfriend status because it was convenient for her. She wanted me to act like a boyfriend. Fine. I give her exactly what she asked for. But boyfriends don't pay their girlfriends bills. Boyfriends don't share bank accounts. Boyfriends don't sacrifice their futures for someone who won't even wear their ring. I started my new boyfriend only poly see the next morning while she was at her yoga class. First, I sold the ring to a dealer for 12 grand, enough to cover what I spent on her car this year alone. Then I called Verizon and removed her from my phone plan. By the time she got home from yoga, I changed every password and moved my money from our joint account. She didn't even notice until lunch when her phone died mid phone call. Babe, my phone's not working, she texted from her laptop, annoyed but not worried. Call Verizon. It's being weird. An hour later, they said I'm not on the account anymore. Then the panic. Started creeping in. What did you do? I responded, I'm being your boyfriend and not your husband, just like you said. She actually laughed at first, thinking it was some kind of joke. She came home that night acting extra sweet. Made my favorite dinner and tried to cuddle on the couch. Okay, you made your point, she said. Kissing my neck. I'll think about what you said. Now fix my phone. I moved to the guest bedroom instead. The next morning, she couldn't log into Netflix. Then Hulu died.

It was 2:00am on a Tuesday and I had work in the morning. But this kid next door had been screaming for three straight hours. Not just normal baby crying, but these gut wrenching wails that made my skin crawl. I tried putting pillows over my head, closing all my windows, even playing loud music through my headphones. Nothing worked. Never met my neighbours properly. They'd moved in about six months ago. This young couple with a baby. The guy seemed okay, always nodded when he saw me getting my mail. The woman looked exhausted every time I saw her, which honestly didn't seem that weird since new parents always look like zombies. But this crying was different. It wasn't stopping and it was getting worse. Around 2:00am, I heard what sounded like furniture being moved around violently. Then a woman's voice shouting something I couldn't make out. That's when I started getting worried. I walked to my window that faced their apartment and tried to see what was going on. Their blinds were mostly closed. I could see shadows moving around frantically. The baby was still screaming, but now it sounded muffled, like someone had closed a door or something. I debated for like 20 minutes whether to call the cops. I mean, what if it was nothing? What if they were just having a rough night and I was being that annoying neighbour Who calls the police over everything? But something felt really wrong. The way the woman had screamed, the furniture noises. Now the baby sounded different, more desperate. So I called 9 1 1. The operator asked me what my emergency was, and I felt stupid saying it, but I told her I thought something might be wrong next door because a baby had been crying for hours and I heard what sounded like a fight. She said they'd send someone to do a welfare check. I figured they'd knock on the door, see that everything was fine, and I'd probably never make eye contact with my neighbors again out of embarrassment.

I mean, in just Virginia alone, over 80 kids have been kidnapped in just the past two weeks. I mean, that comes out to about six or seven kidnappings per day. What the fuck is going on? I mean, more importantly, who the fuck is kidnapping all these kids? I mean, fuck, they must have turned the flash into a child predator. And it's not even just the flash. I mean, this motherfucker had to have teamed up with fucking bad, man. Like, there's no way these kids are disappearing this fast and without a trace. Now, a growing theory right now is that ice cream trucks are being used to kidnap these kids. Now if you just look it up in the TikTok search bar or just online in general, you'll see a bunch of videos of ice cream trucks recently being just a no, too suspicious. I mean, there's videos surfacing right now of ice cream trucks being out as late as eleven PM. An ice cream truck at night? Yeah, uh, no thanks. I choose life. I'm gonna be honest though, if ice cream trucks are actually being used to kidnap these children, I mean, it's just natural fucking selection at this point. I mean, we are in the big 2025. I mean, who in their right fucking mind is still going up to ice Cream trucks, especially at night time. It's like, come on, buddy, is your fucking brain located in your fucking ass? I will say, though, I was driving to my friend's house the other night, and I saw a suspicious ice cream truck on the way there, and, you know, I didn't. I didn't really think anything of it. Then on the drive home around 10 p m, I saw another, and I still didn't really think anything of it. Then I saw another, and I was like, okay, what in the true crime documentary is going on right here?

She returned 6 years later to find I divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years Max. Don't change the locks. He left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation to our 8 year olds. That first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decisions. No more walking on eggs shells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curve ball in our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year 2 brought unexpected changes without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I've been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd forgotten How to enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake cookies and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her Bonus Mom, their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes and tuck them in at night. Year 5 was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year 6, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward after Three years of zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from the living room. Through the window, we watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck, pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she owned the plate.

Logan had been complaining for weeks that I hovered too much. When we went out at his company's holiday party, he pulled me aside near the coat check. Listen. Tonight, can you just not be so attached to me? My coworkers think it's weird how you're always by my side. Just mingle on your own. For once, I smiled sweetly. Of course, babe, I'll give you tons of space. Really? You're not upset? Not at all. You want independence at parties? You got it. The party was at this upscale rooftop venue, open bar, DJ, the Works. Logan immediately ditched me to bro out with his work buddies, leaving me by the entrance. Perfect. I walked straight to the bar where his boss, Thomas, was getting drinks. Emily, where's Logan? Oh, he wanted space. Tonight, I'm flying solo. Thomas looked confused at his own company party. He says I'm too clingy, didn't want me cramping his style. Thomas's wife, Diane overheard. He left you alone. How rude. No worries. I'll just entertain myself. And I did. I ended up in a fascinating conversation with the CFO about cryptocurrency. Then the head of HR pulled me into their group to settle a debate about true crime podcasts. I was having a genuinely great time. An hour in, I caught Logan's eye across the room. He was with his bros but kept glancing over As I laughed with his supervisors, then the DJ started playing salsa music. This gorgeous guy from accounting, Javier, asked if I could dance. I'd love to. We tore up that dance floor. Turns out Javier was a semi professional dancer. He spun me, dipped me the whole nine yards. Proud form to watch. Logan appeared suddenly. Hey, maybe we should, oh, am I being too clingy? I asked mid spin. No, I just, great. Then you won't mind if I keep dancing. Javier dipped me dramatically. The crowd cheered. Logan retreated to the bar Downing whiskey with his confused buddies. Later, the CEO's wife pulled me aside. You're Logan's girlfriend. We need to talk. She dragged me to her table full of executives wives. They immediately adopted me, pouring champagne and gossiping about everyone. Logan usually brags about you non stop. One said, where is he? He needed guy time. Apparently I hover. They exchanged looks. Men are idiots, the CEO's wife declared, raising her glass. Toasted to that. Logan kept trying to approach, but every time he got close, someone else would pull me into conversation. His female co workers wanted workout tips. The it guys needed restaurant recommendations. Even the janitor asked for relationship advice. Everyone loved me except Logan who looked increasingly miserable. Then came the speeches. CEO grabbed the mic thanking everyone for their hard work. Special shout out to Emily for bringing such amazing energy tonight. Logan, you're a lucky man. Everyone clapped looking Around for Logan. He was sulking by the bathroom. Where's Logan? The CEO asked into the mic. He wanted space. So when yelled laughter erupted, the CEO's wife grabbed the mic. Well, his loss. Emily's been the life of the party. More cheering. Logan's face went red. Around midnight, the party was winding down. I was.

It started when my sister Chloe came home crying because her boyfriend Jake dumped her. She's 25 and I'm 17, but she always acts like she's the victim in every situation. This time was different, though. She kept saying Jake was horrible and cruel. But when I asked what happened, she got all shifty. She said he broke up with her out of nowhere and kicked her out of his apartment. But then she mentioned she still had keys to his place because she forgot to give them back. The next day, she left early in the morning and came back with this huge golden retriever. I recognized him immediately. It was Buster, Jake's dog. Jake love that dog more than anything. When his grandpa died last year, Buster was the only thing that helped him through it. I asked Chloe why she had Buster, and she got this weird smile on her face. She said Jake didn't deserve to keep him since he broke her heart. Then she said something that made my stomach drop. She told me she was going to take Buster to the vet tomorrow to put him down as payback for what Jake did to her. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. This dog was completely healthy and happy, just confused about being in a new place. Buster kept looking around for Jake and whining by the door. It was heartbreaking. I told Chloe she was being insane and she couldn't just kill someone's dog because she was upset. She laughed and said Jake should have thought about that before he decided to hurt her. Then she said if I told anyone, she'd make sure I regretted it. That night I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about Buster and how scared he must be. Around 2 a. M. I heard Chloe on the phone with someone, probably making the vet appointment. I knew I had to do something. Then next morning, Chloe left for work and told mom she was taking Buster for a walk later. Mom didn't know the whole story. Chloe just said Jake asked her to watch his dog for a few days. As soon as both of them were gone, I called. Jake picked up on the first ring and sounded terrible. I told him Chloe had Buster and was planning to put him down today. He went completely silent for like 10 seconds then started freaking out. He said he'd been looking everywhere for Buster and thought maybe he got out somehow. I told Jake to come over now while Chloe was at work. He was at our house in 15 minutes. When he saw Buster, he literally started crying. Buster went crazy with excitement, jumping all over him and licking his face. I opened the door and Jake carried his dog out to his car. Before he left, Jake told me what really happened with Chloe. She didn't just get dumped. She cheated on him with his best friend, Marcus. When Jake found out, he broke up with her and told her to move out. She stole Buster on her way out and left Jake's spare key on the counter so he thought she was being mature about the breakup. A few hours later, Chloe came home and went straight to look for Buster. When she couldn't find him, she started screaming my name. She found me in my room and absolutely lost it. He called me a traitor and said I had no right to interfere in her business. Then mom came home and asked what all the yelling was about. Chloe told her I let some guy steal her dog. She made it sound like I just gave away her pet to a random stranger. Mom looked.

Like I swear if I hear that shit one more time I'm gonna lose it. It's like this goofy ass trend spawned out of thin air cause where the fuck did it come from? Who the hell started this bullshit? I literally don't get the meme at all. This shit is just two fucking numbers. And this shit low key reminds me of when everyone ran around saying 21 years ago, except this is worse. At least with 21 we knew it was from that dumb little vine. With 6 7 they just pulled a number out their ass and made it a lifestyle. Like I swear I'll be in class and the teacher will be like who wants to read the next paragraph? And Dylan all the way in the back just yells out 6 7 and the whole room dies like Kevin Hart just walked in. Meanwhile I'm questioning if I need to go back to kindergarten and relearn math. And the worst part? It's contagious. You start hating it, but after hearing it all day you catch yourself doing it too. At this point I'm convinced 6 7 doesn't mean a damn thing. It's just TikTok brain rot at its peak. You dumbasses could have picked any number, but now y'all went with 6 7 and now we're all stuck living in the 6 7 cinematic universe. So yeah, fuck whoever made that bullshit and if I see it again I'm gonna kill myself making out

And you know, he created a TikTok page he got the mangoes and a barber shop haircut that cost a quarter. But man, brain rot is getting worse. It's to the point where we review Bomb places with brain rot meme. At first I felt bad for the owner getting bombed by us generation, but later on he's getting it and I don't even feel bad anymore. Like, come on, just appreciate the free 5 stars. But one thing I don't really find it funny is that one dude was part of the review bombing squad and he gave the barber shop one star.

A decomposing body was found in the back of David's car? This dude was carrying TikTok in 2022 with in the back of My Mind song, but now he's too busy carrying dead bodies. Apparently, the car had been towed a couple days prior, but after a couple days, the residents started complaining that one of their cars had almost like a fishy Gucci type of smell. So they opened up the trunk of one of the cars that was a Tesla that was under the name of David. And David, you should know lions don't do drills inside of Teslas, bro. They're not good at keeping smell. And they have cameras, bro. You can at least have wrap the body up better, bro. I would know. Before the car was impounded, it was abandoned on Hollywood Boulevard for about 5 days, not stolen like everybody thinks it is. So I know this might hurt to hear. It might hit y'all in the heart, but David might have just committed romantic homicide. Apparently, Bro's on tour, but it's only a matter of time before bro gets tackled on stage like Ray Rice did his wife and gets taken to jail. Speaking to the police department, though, please don't arrest David, Bro. We need his songs for invincible Season 4. Bro. This is more important than the Body, Gang. This is more important, bro. I need good music on that season 4.

A girl got stabbed on the subway and no one helped her. A decomposing body found in D4V D's car. A man was beheaded at Dallas motel. Charlie Kirk getting shot and killed at a university. And all on top of that, the 9 11 was 24 years ago today. As much as I hate Charlie Kirk and his decisions, no one deserves to get killed. Imagine what his wife and kids are feeling right now. His children can't grow up with their dad. His wife is now a single parent. I genuinely hate Charlie, but I can't imagine how his family is handling this right now. And apparently they witnessed it. The way the blood came out of his neck was genuinely traumatizing. The way his body went limp immediately was horrifying. But anyways, moving on to the D4V d situation. He's been on tour for like, what, a month now? He hasn't been in LA for like a month. And the body hadn't decomposed enough for it to be in that car for so long. The body was in there for three days and the police haven't even made him a suspect. And plus, he had a concert like yesterday, I'm pretty sure. But yeah, moving on to the girl that was stabbed, she was literally minding her business before she got stabbed. And as soon as she got stabbed, everyone was so Calm, like, hello, she needs help. There was literal blood dripping on the floor. I don't have much information on the other situations, but the fact that this is all happened in a week is honestly scary. Like this month has just started. What's going on?

Everybody starts running. And there are conflicting reports on whether or not the assailant, the one that attacked Charlie, is in custody or not. Right now, we just don't have a lot of information.

None of us here really agree with Charlie's views, but he's still a human being. He has family that cares about him. And this is just awful, and this is not what we should be doing. Let's be really respectful during this time. It doesn't matter if you're red or you're blue. We need to come together because this is Violence, and violence is not okay

She returned 6 years later to find I divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years Max. Don't change the locks. She left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation to our 8 year olds. That first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parent decisions. No more walking on eggshells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curve ball our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year 2 brought unexpected changes without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I've been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd forgotten how to Enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her Bonus Mom, their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes and tucked them in at night. Year 5 was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. Their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year 6, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward after three years of Zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from the living.

Two women in our accounting department got pregnant at almost the exact same time. Jessica found out first and was super excited, showing everyone her ultrasound photos and talking about baby names during lunch breaks. Three weeks later, Amber announced she was also pregnant, due just two weeks after Jessica. Everyone was thrilled. The whole office was buzzing about having two babies so close together. Both women submitted their maternity leave paperwork right away, since we needed time to arrange coverage for their positions. Jessica went on leave first. When her daughter was born, everything seemed normal. Then Amber went into labour early, about a week before her scheduled leave was supposed to start. That's when things got weird. Our payroll system flagged an error. When I tried to process Amber's leave, it said someone had already filed maternity leave under her name and Social Security number. I figured it was just a computer glitch, so I called our IT department. They pulled up the records and found something impossible. According to our system, Amber had already been on maternity leave for three weeks. But she'd been working the whole time. She was literally at her desk yesterday. I started digging deeper and found the original leave request filed under Amber's name. It had her Social Security number, her employee ID, everything. But the submission date was from a month ago, right when Jessica Had filed hers. Something was seriously wrong here. I pulled the security footage from the day the duplicate paperwork was submitted. At 6:47 p m, after most people had left, Jessica was sitting at Amber's desk, using her computer. She spent 43 minutes there printing documents and filling out forms. But it got worse. Way worse.

Because it looks like you're getting paid every Friday for the past three months by someone whose contact name is literally Sugar daddy Mike with money bag emojis. He turned his phone toward me showing the evidence. Are you seriously doing that kind of work? Without telling me, I grabbed my phone back, my face burning red. Jake, I swear to God it's not what you think. Mike is my boss at the pet sitting company. He stared at me like I'd grown a third leg. Your boss pays you through Venmo and you call him Sugar Daddy Mike? I realized how absolutely insane this sounded, but it was the truth. The company payroll system has been broken for months. Mike pays all the employees through Venmo. And I saved his contact as Sugar Daddy Mike as a joke because he's always buying us coffee and treats for the dogs. Jake was not buying this explanation at all. That's the most ridiculous cover story I've ever heard. Look, I'll prove it. I called Mike right there in our kitchen. He answered on the second ring with his Usual cheerful voice. Hey, and you're not scheduled until this afternoon. Everything okay? I put him on speaker. Mike, my boyfriend thinks we're having some kind of inappropriate relationship because of how you pay us and how your name shows up in my phone. Mike burst out laughing. Oh, no, not again. This happened with my daughter's boyfriend last month. He thought she was cheating on him with her sugar daddy Mike. He explained to Jake that his payroll company had been hacked six months ago, so he'd been paying everyone through cash apps. Jake still looked skeptical. But why Sugar Daddy Mike? Mike laughed even harder. Because I spoil my employees and the pets rotten. Free coffee every day, premium dog treats, bonuses for good work. The girls started calling me Sugar Daddy Mike because I'm always buying supplies and treating them like family. He invited Jake to come by the office to meet the team. You can meet the other four dog walkers who probably also have me saved as Sugar Daddy Mike in their phones. I could see Jake starting to believe the story, but he was still embarrassed about jumping to conclusion. This is why you should have just told me you had a job, he muttered. After we hung up with Mike, Jake apologized profusely. I should have just asked you directly instead of making assumptions. But then he got curious about other things. Wait, if you're only making $250 twice a month, how are You paying for all those expensive dinners you've getting delivered? My stomach dropped because I've been hoping he wouldn't notice my Doordash habit. That's a different situation, I said, trying to change the subject. But Jake was already connecting dots. Please tell me you're not actually doing sugar daddy stuff on the side to pay for food. I just waved it off and tried to ignore him for the rest of the day. The next day, I brought Jake to the pet sitting office to meet Mike and prove my story. He was exactly what you'd expect, 50 something guy in dog hair covered clothes who immediately offered us both coffee and dog treats to sample. See, he said to Jake, total sugar daddy behaviour but completely innocent. The other employees confirmed that they all had similar contact names for Mike and that he was basically the most generous boss ever. Last month he paid for my dog's vet Bill when I couldn't afford it, one co worker said. Jake felt terrible for assuming the worst and bought lunch for the whole pet sitting crew as an apology. I watched too much true crime, he explained to Mike. When I I saw those payments, my mind immediately went to the darkest possibility. Mike laughed it off and said it happened more often than you'd think. My wife gets suspicious, looks at the bank when she deposits checks made out to Sugar Daddy, Mike's Pet Care. That night, Jake finally relaxed. Convinced everything was fine. But when I checked my phone before bed, another 500 dollar transfer came in. The message read, good job. He bought every word.

You mean to tell me that someone was infected with the plague in 2025? Like, how do you even let that happen? This isn't a cold. This isn't allergies. This is the plague. That's the kind of word you should only read in a museum plaque. Not here on a Tuesday morning news update. And the way the news says it is always so casual. A rare case of the plague was reported this week. Rare, bro. Rare should mean never again. That's not supposed to be in circulation. That's like saying, oh, yeah, someone caught smallpox on their lunch break. They'll hit you with, don't worry, it's treatable now. Okay, cool. But imagine being the one person who goes to urgent care with a fever and the doctor walks in wearing a bird mask and carrying a bag of leeches. That's not medical attention. That's a medieval horror show. Like think about how cooked we are if the plague can just pop back up. We've got a I rockets to Mars and somehow we're still fighting the same disease that wiped out half of Europe. That's not progress. That's a rerun. Every headline feels less like news and more like a countdown. First, it was Covid tearing everything apart. Then wildfires turning skies orange. Now the plague shows up. Tell me this doesn't feel like end credits.

It started at Thanksgiving when my cousin wouldn't shut up about me being single. She kept asking why I never brought anyone home, making these fake concerned faces at the dinner table. So when she said, I must be dating someone special, I just nodded, gave him a name right on the spot. Daniel said he was busy with work. My family ate it up. But then Christmas rolled around and my mom started asking when she could meet Daniel. My aunt kept texting about setting an extra place at dinner. I was stuck. That's when my roommate Becca suggested her coworker, Daniel, who owed her big time for covering his shifts. He showed me his Instagram, tall brown hair, actually decent looking. He agreed to one dinner as a favor. The problem, he didn't just show up and fake smile through dinner. He brought flowers for my mom, asked my dad about his woodworking hobby and somehow knew my grandmother collected vintage tea cups because I'd mentioned it once when building the fake story. He even laughed at my little brother's terrible jokes about robots. My family was obsessed. After that first dinner, my mom kept inviting him back, Easter brunch, my cousin's graduation party, random Sunday dinners. Daniel never said no. He text me beforehand asking what to bring, if anyone had allergies, stuff like that. He started sending my brother updates about basketball. Scores. My dad asked him to help fix our back porch. The worst part was how natural it felt. We drive to my parents house together and he'd ask about my day like we actually dated, remembered my coffee order, knew I hated mushrooms, would grab my jacket when I got cold. During family game night, he'd automatically pick me as his partner. We had inside jokes that weren't even planned. One night after my aunt's birthday party, we sat in his car outside my apartment in complete silence. Everyone had spent the whole night saying how perfect we looked together, how lucky I was. My grandmother even pulled me aside to say Daniel was a keeper. The whole car ride home, I kept filling glances at him, wondering what he was thinking. I started rehearsing speeches in my bathroom mirror, practice bringing it up casually over coffee. But every time I opened my mouth, nothing came out. How do you tell someone you caught feelings for a fake relationship? Everything changed at Christmas dinner. My aunt announced she'd been looking at wedding venues for us, that she found the perfect place for next fall. Daniel laughed it off perfectly, made some joke about her getting ahead of herself. But later that night, he texted me, we can't keep this up forever. You know, that message hit me like a truck. I realized he was ready to end this whole thing and I wasn't, not even close. Instead of texting Back or giving him some weird speech. I invited him over for dinner at my place, cooked his favorite pasta dish, the one my mom always made when he came over the table with actual candles, not just the overhead light. After we finished eating, I was washing dishes and he was drying them, just like we did at my parents house. That's when I finally said it. I know this.

So I changed the locks, canceled every privilege in my name and told their father pick up was tonight. No one argued. I'm Tom, 35, and I've been married to Lisa for 18 months. She has two kids from her first marriage, Marcus, 17, and Sophia, 15. Their biological father lives about 40 minutes away and sees them maybe twice a month when he feels like showing up. When Lisa and I got together, I genuinely wanted to be the stepdad I never had growing up. My own father walked out when I was 12, so I knew what it felt like to need a father figure. I thought being a good stepdad meant being the yes man, always supportive, always generous, always understanding. New school clothes? Sure, no problem. Concert tickets for Sophia's favorite band, of course. When Marcus wanted the latest gaming setup, I dropped $800 without blinking when he crashed my car last month after staying hang out past curfew. I didn't even make him pay the 500 dollar deductible. But respect, that was a completely different story. It started with small things. You're not our real dad became their go to response whenever I asked them to do basic household tasks. When I'd ask Marcus to take out the trash, he'd say, I only listen to actual parents. When Sophia left dishes piled in the sink for days, she'd shrug and say, my mom didn't tell Me to clean them. Lisa would have talks with them about respect and they'd apologize and behave for maybe a week. Then we'd be right back to the same pattern. The breaking point came last Friday. I decided to leave work early to surprise Lisa with dinner plans for our anniversary weekend. I pulled into the driveway around 3 in the afternoon and immediately knew something was wrong. There were cars I didn't recognize park on our street and I could hear music blasting from inside the house. I walked through my front door to find about 20 teenagers having a full blown party in my living room. Red solo cups everywhere. The coffee table pushed against the wall. Kids I'd never seen before eating food from my kitchen. My house was completely trashed. Broken lamp, mysterious stains on my white couch, empty bottles scattered everywhere. Marcus was in the center of it all, acting like the king of the castle when he saw me. He didn't even look embarrassed, just annoyed that I'd shown up. Party's over, I said loudly. Everyone out now. The music stopped. Kids started grabbing their stuff and heading for the door, but Marcus didn't move. Clean this mess up immediately, I told him once the house was empty. He actually laughed. You can't tell me what to do. You're not my father. This is my house, Marcus. My couch that's ruined. My lamp that's broke. Can no. Sophia interrupted, appearing from the kitchen. It's Mom's house, too. We live here. We only take orders from real family, not from some guy mom married. That's when I noticed something that made my blood run cold. The door to my home office was wide open, and I always kept it locked. I walked over and immediately saw that my safe was open. My emergency cash envelope, the one where I've been saving money for Lisa's surprise birthday trip to Hawaii, was completely empty. $2,000 gone. I turned around slowly. Where's my money? Marcus shrugged with this smug expression. What money? I don't know what you're talking about. $2,000 from my safe. The safe that was locked this morning. Prove we took it, Sophia said with a smile. That made me realize this wasn't just disrespect anymore.

She returned 6 years later to find I divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years Max. Don't change the locks. She left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation to our 8 year olds. That first night was brutal. Sky, Taylor kept asking when Mommy was coming home and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decisions. No more walking on eggshells around her moods. Things. Year 1 was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curve ball in our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year 2 brought unexpected changes without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids'grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I've been so focused on fixing my marriage that I've forgotten how To enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor, I only helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught sky to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her Bonus Mom, their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes and tucked them in at night. Year 5 was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year 6, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward after Three years of zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from the living.

If you really loved me, you'd wanna fix this. I looked at her calmly. You want me to fight for our marriage? Yes, obviously. Okay. I pulled out my phone and called her best friend, Janet, the twice divorced one who'd been coaching her. Hey, Janet, it's James. Quick question. Do you think my wife should stay married to someone she regrets being with? My wife's face went white. That's what I thought. Thanks for the honest advice. I hung up and looked at my wife. Janet says, you should definitely leave me. Congratulations. Your advisor just made the decision for you. She started crying. That's not what I wanted. Funny because three months ago you said Janet's advice was the best thing that ever happened to you. But I wasn't done. I called Crystal next 1 who spends weekends bar hopping crying about how all men are trash. Crystal, hey, my wife's been telling me about your amazing Single life. Should she join you? Live that authentic truth with you guys. Talk about. Through the phone, Crystal's voice got quiet. Well, I mean, maybe you two should work it out. Work it out. But you told her marriage was a prison last Tuesday. At least that's what she came home saying. I put the phone on speaker so my wife could hear Crystal back pedal. I was just venting about my own situation. I didn't mean. Oh, so when you said dump his ass and live for yourself, you were just venting. Silence. Then I called Debbie, the twice divorced one living with her parents at 35. Debbie, great news. My wife's finally ready to take your advice about leaving me. When can she move in with you and your mom? Move in. I, there's not really room here. But you said independence was worth any sacrifice. My wife was pale watching her support system crumble in real time. After I hung up, she whispered, they were just trying to help, help. Debbie's eating cereal for dinner because she can't afford groceries. Crystal hasn't had a second date in two years. Janet's on antidepressants because she's so lonely. You don't understand their situations. I understand perfectly. Three miserable women convinced you to throw away a good marriage so you could be miserable with them. She sat down hard. But they said I deserved better. Better than what? A faithful husband who works two job so you can go To yoga class. Better than someone who's never lied to you or cheated. The silent stretch. They said marriage kills your soul. Whose soul got killed? Mine listening to you repeat your poison every night. Or yours because you let strangers reprogram you. She started crying again. I don't know what I want anymore. I do. You want their approval more than my love? You got it. The irony, her friends are now panicking, realizing they pushed too hard. Janet called later begging me not to divorce her because she didn't really mean it. Crystal.

My life has been a living hell since they found my channel and it's getting worse every day, all because of one group of girls. Like it started with hate comments and putting pictures in my locker, but the final straw was when they came into school and handed me a T-shirt of my channel asking if I could sign it since I'm so famous. And bro, her friends acted like this was the funniest thing they've ever seen. But I wasn't gonna just let this slide now. So I did some digging and found all their social media channels and saw that they're actually trying to blow up on TikTok themselves, just not with much success. So since they wanna be famous, I'll make them famous by exposing everything they said all in this video, then sending it to their parents, future college, and blowing this video up from millions to see.

For 17 years, I lived with two different fathers. The perfect employee who preached about his perfect marriage and strong kids, and the man who made mom sob herself to sleep for buying the wrong coffee brand. Mom Learned to time grocery shopping before his Thursday bowling league when he'd be rushed. Once she forgot, dad discovered generic pasta instead of name brand. You're too stupid to even shop, right? No wonder you never amounted to anything. He made her return every item while he watched, then quizzed her on prices to prove she was wasting his money. She cried in the car afterward. That weekend's company barbecue. I do the shopping because the wife gets overwhelmed by choices. His co workers laughed at how understanding he was. My brother walked past Dad's home office during a virtual meet. Invisible for just two seconds, dad kept smiling, discussing collaborative workspace culture. The second he clicked leave meeting, he cornered my brother. You made me look like I can't control my own house. The belt came out. Two weeks of complete silence followed. My brother stopped eating, stopped talking at school. Teachers thought he was just shy. I saved money from my part time job for college application fees, knowing he'd never support it. He found them anyway. You think you're better than me? He burned them in the kitchen sink while I watched. Later, his boss Asked about my plans. She's applying everywhere. We stay up late working on essays together. I nodded and smiled, knowing I'd missed every deadline. Two fathers. Only we knew which one was real. Then my dad announced, the CEO is coming to dinner on Saturday. After ten years grinding for senior VP, a 1 hundred thousand dollar promotion, it came down to this. The CEO was famous for his values based leadership. He'd fired executives for screaming at waitstaff. I passed over vps for bad parenting in public. Now he wanted to see Dad's home life personally. With a three hour dinner. One mistake, dad hissed, and I'll make you regret it forever. But dad had never maintained his perfect act at home for more than 20 minutes. Phone calls, easy, quick. Doorway chats, no problem. But three hours in his kingdom, where he trained us to fear him. That's never happened before. Watched Mom's hands shake, my brother shrink into his chair. For 17 years, home was where dad dropped his mask. Saturday, he'd have to keep it on for three whole hours. There was no way, right? We all prepared like our lives depended on it. Practiced conversations, rehearsed dinner etiquette. Cleaned until the house looked like a magazine spread. I helped mom cover the bags under her eyes. My brother practiced speaking in full sentences. Again. Dad was a wreck. Pretending to be calm. He'd bark orders, catch himself, force a smile. Remember, we're a happy family. He'd say through gritted teeth, the vein in his forehead pulsing. Saturday arrived and the doorbell rang. Showtime, Dad whispered, transforming into the man his co workers knew. A warm smile with a firm handshake. Welcome to our home. The first hour was perfect. Dad told charming stories. We laughed at the right moments. Mom served flawlessly. But I watched dad carefully. Saw his jaw clench when my brother took too long answering a question. I noticed his knuckles whitening when mom laughed too loudly at the CEO's joke. I watched that familiar vein start to pulse. By hour, two cracks appeared. His smile became strained, his laugh forced. He was gripping his wine glass so tight, I thought it might shatter. This was the longest he'd ever had to pretend in his own home. And it was killing him. I didn't have to do anything. I just had to wait. Then it happened. During dessert, mom served the sea

Congratulations. That's called being a human. Look, I get it. Mental health awareness is hella important. It's amazing that people are talking about it more openly now. But here's the problem. Scrolling through hashtags at 2:00am is not the same thing as a professional evaluation. Google is not your therapist. ID Labs, tests are not your psychiatrist. And that one influencer who talks about their symptoms in a story time, definitely not a doctor. When everyone just casually slaps a label on themselves, it waters down the real struggles people actually face. Like someone living with legit OCD is out here battling life every day. And then some dude is like, oh my God, I'm so OCD. I color code my closet. No, you're not OCD. You're just organized, my guy. And even with depression, just because you're feeling a little sad one week does not mean you have depression unless you're diagnosed. I don't wanna hear it. You're free to self pity in private. But self diagnosing is probably one of the most selfish and attention seeking things you can do. Faith out.

It started at Thanksgiving when my cousin wouldn't shut up about me being single. She kept asking why I never brought anyone home, making these fake concerned faces at the dinner table. So when she said, I must be dating someone special, I just nodded, gave him a name right on the spot. Daniel said he was busy with work. My family ate it up. But then Christmas rolled around and my mom started asking when she could meet Daniel. My aunt kept texting about setting an extra place at dinner. I was stuck. That's when my roommate Becca suggested her coworker, Daniel, who owed her big time for covering his shifts. He showed me his Instagram, tall brown hair, actually decent looking. He agreed to one dinner as a favor. The problem, he didn't just show up and fake smile through dinner. He brought flowers for my mom, asked my dad about his woodworking hobby and somehow knew my grandmother collected vintage tea cups because I'd mentioned it once when building the fake story. He even laughed at my little brother's terrible jokes about robots. My family was obsessed. After that first dinner, my mom kept inviting him back, Easter brunch, my cousin's graduation party, random Sunday dinners. Daniel never said no. He text me beforehand asking what to bring, if anyone had allergies, stuff like that. He started sending my brother updates about basketball. Scores. My dad asked him to help fix our back porch. The worst part was how natural it felt. We drive to my parents house together and he'd ask about my day like we actually dated, remembered my coffee order, knew I hated mushrooms, would grab my jacket when I got cold. During family game night, he'd automatically pick me as his partner. We had inside jokes that weren't even planned. One night after my aunt's birthday party, we sat in his car outside my apartment in complete silence. Everyone had spent the whole night saying how perfect we looked together, how lucky I was. My grandmother even pulled me aside to say Daniel was a keeper. The whole car ride home, I kept filling glances at him, wondering what he was thinking. I started rehearsing speeches in my bathroom mirror, practice bringing it up casually over coffee. But every time I opened my mouth, nothing came out. How do you tell someone you caught feelings for a fake relationship? Everything changed at Christmas dinner. My aunt announced she'd been looking at wedding venues for us, that she found the perfect place for next fall. Daniel laughed it off perfectly, made some joke about her getting ahead of herself. But later that night, he texted me, we can't keep this up forever. You know, that message hit me like a truck. I realized he was ready to end this whole thing and I wasn't, not even close. Instead of texting Back or giving him some weird speech. I invited him over for dinner at my place, cooked his favorite pasta dish, the one my mom always made when he came over the table with actual candles, not just the overhead light. After we finished eating, I was washing dishes and he was drying them, just like we did at my parents house. That's when I finally said it. I know this.

Charlie Kirk getting shot and killed at a university. And all on top of that, the 9 11 was 24 years ago today. As much as I hate Charlie Kirk and his decisions, no one deserves to get killed. Imagine what his wife and kids are feeling right now. His children can't grow up with their dad. His wife is now a single parent. I genuinely hate Charlie, but I can't imagine how his family is handling this right now. And apparently they witnessed it. The way the blood came out of his neck was genuinely traumatizing. The way his body went limp immediately was horrifying. But anyways, moving on to the D4 V D situation. He's been on tour for like, what, a month now? He hasn't been in LA for like a month. And the body hadn't decomposed enough for it to be in that car for so long. The body was in there for three days. The police haven't even made him a suspect. And plus he had a concert like yesterday, I'm pretty sure. But yeah, moving on to the girl that was stabbed. She was literally minding her business before she got stabbed. And as soon as she got stabbed, everyone was so Calm. Like, hello, she needs help. There was literal blood dripping on the floor. I don't have much information on the other situations, but the fact that this is all happened in a week is honestly scary. Like, this month has just started. What's going on

Because last night I was just scrolling, and a random person texted me saying, you should check out the ducky filter. And like the curious little George I am, I looked up the ducky filter, and I saw a little duck on the screen, and it said, tap the screen. And what did I do? I tap the dang screen. And when I say I scream so loud, I mean I tea. Because how is TikTok allows something like that? I threw my phone across the room so fast, not even the flash could save my phone in time.

My high school made all the boys holding their pee because someone wrote hi on the wall in Sharpie. Monday morning, we all showed up to find a sign taped to the boys bathroom door, closed until further notice due to vandalism. The girls bathroom was still open, of course, but our school only had one bathroom for boys in the entire building because it was an old school built in the 60s when they apparently thought teenage boys never needed to pee. Principal Carpenter made an announcement during 1st period, due to the disrespectful graffiti found in the boys restroom, this facility will remain locked until someone comes forward with information about who did it. The entire male population of our high school groaned at the same time. The crazy part was what the graffiti actually said. My friend Peyton had seen it Friday before they locked everything up. Someone had written hi in tiny letters on the bathroom stall. Not a curse word, not a drawing, just hi, I in black Sharpie about the size of a quarter. By lunch, the situation was getting desperate. Guys were asking teachers for hall passes to go to the nurse's office just to use that bathroom. But the school nurse caught on quick and started turning people away unless they were actually sick. Some guys tried using the staff bathroom but got detention for that. A few desperate souls walked To the gas station across the street during lunch. But security started watching for that, too. We tried talking to Principal Carpenter. Reasonably group of five guys went to his office to explain that punishing 300 boys for one tiny word was insane. He sat behind his big desk with his arms crossed. Actions have consequences. When the vandal comes forward, everyone gets bathroom privileges back. By Wednesday, things were getting bad. Guys were dehydrated from not drinking water all day. The basketball team couldn't practice properly because half the players were holding it in. Parents started calling to complain. The carpenter wouldn't budge. He sent out an email saying this was a lesson in collective responsibility. That's when Dean Patterson had his brilliant idea. He was this quiet kid.

The last one will shock you. His body language gives him away. He sneaks, glances at you, but quickly looks away when you notice. His feet or body are often pointed toward you. He plays with his hands, adjust clothes, taps foot when you're around. TikTok knows someone who has feelings for you, but it's too afraid to tell you it's the second person. When you click share and more, he gets nervous around you. His voice cracks or he stumbles over words. When talking to you, he finds small excuses to be near you. He shows up where you are more often than coincidence allows. He remembers the little things. Comment I hate when and let your keyboard finish the sentence. Even if he doesn't talk much, he notices details about you, like your favourite snack, something you said weeks ago. He pays attention in ways others might overlook. He interacts differently with you than with others. He may be loud and confident with friends, but quiet around you. He engages online more than in person. He texts, comments, or likes your posts, but is quieter face to face. He's more relaxed when there's no direct eye contact. Before the last fact. Please like the video and follow or you might never see me again. His friends know something. They tease him when you're around.

She returned 6 years later to find I divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years Max. Change the locks. She left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation to our 8 year olds. That first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decisions. No more walking on eggshells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curve ball when our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year 2 brought unexpected changes without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids'grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping. I realized I've been so focused on fixing my marriage that I've forgotten how to enjoy my Children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her Bonus Mom, their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes and tucked them in at night. Year 5 was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and be being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year 6, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward after three years of Zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from the living room. Through the window, we watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck, pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she owned the plate.

My wife Stephanie, waited until we were eating dessert at Cassie and Paul's house to drop this on me. We should swap partners every Thursday, she said, and I literally watched her put her hand on Paul's thigh under the table. I saw it. Cassie saw it, too, and her face went blank. What? I asked because I honestly thought I heard her wrong. Partner swapping. We date each other's spouses. Said it like she was talking about switching cars for the weekend. Paul kept staring at his plate and wouldn't make eye contact with me. It's already decided, Stephanie said. Thursday nights, you take Cassie out, Paul takes me. I felt my chest get tight. When did they decide this without me? This is insane, I told her. Then she leaned in close and whispered, room 2:37 last Tuesday when you were at work. My whole body went numb. She was telling me she'd already cheated and now wanted my permission to keep doing it. So are you in or not? She asked louder. I looked at Cassie, and she was crying without making any sound. Fine, I said. Let's swap partners. Stephanie smiled like she just won something, but. And I noticed Cassie had stopped crying completely. That should have told me something right there. When the first date night came around, Stephanie spent forever getting ready. She put on this red Dress I'd never seen before that she'd been hiding in our closet. Paul's car was already running in our driveway when I left. I brought Cassie white roses because I remembered she mentioned liking them once. Her hands shook when she took them. Paul? Never. She started, then stopped. At dinner. She pushed her food around and barely ate anything. You okay? I asked. Paul's been different, she said quietly. For months, even before. Then she stopped talking again. I reached over and touched her hand. Before what? Nothing. Forget I said anything. But then her phone lit up with Stephanie's name, and she turned it face down immediately. When I got home that night, Stephanie was already there. Her hair was all messed up and her lipstick was smeared on the wrong side of her mouth. How is Cassie? Good. It was Paul. Then she started telling me everything they did. The hotel room, the balcony, what they did against the wall. She kept getting louder with each detail. Stop, I told her. Why? Don't you wanna know? No. Her face got all twisted up. Well, I'm telling you anyway. She kept going with more details while I pulled out my phone and texted Cassie, thank you for a lovely evening. Stephanie saw my screen and threw her wine glass at the wall. It shattered everywhere, and I just stood there looking at her. The next week, I had to pick Cassie up because her car broke down. Out Of nowhere. Paul was supposed to drive me, she said, looking confused. I forgot at dinner. She had way too much wine. Can I tell you something? She asked, and her eyes looked glassy. Tuesday afternoons. That's when it started. My heart started racing. What started? She covered her mouth with her hand. Nothing. Forget it. But Tuesday was when Stephanie had mentioned the hotel and we both knew what she meant. Then we had to go to Stephanie's parents house for dinner. Stephanie showed up late and I could smell Paul's Cologne all over her clothes. Her mom noticed it right away and her face changed. Is that men's Cologne? The whole table went quiet. We're sharing partners with Cassie and Paul, I said. Every week. Her dad dropped his fork and it made this loud sound. Sharing? Taking turns dating each other's spouses. Stephanie's idea. Her mom stood up from the table in my house, she said, and her voice was shaking. Stephanie tried to explain, but everyone had already smelled the Cologne and knew what was happening. That night Cassie called me. I know about Tuesday afternoons. I felt sick to my stomach about them. I followed Paul once four months ago to the hotel. She sounded drunk. I saw everything. By week five, everything fell apart. It was Cassie's birthday and I threw her a surprise party, made a video of all her artwork and gave the speech about how talented and kind she was. Paul Forgot it was her birthday completely. I watched Stephanie watch Cassie cry happy tears and hold on to me like she didn't want to let go. That night, Stephanie came home from Paul's and started telling me what they did in graphic detail again. Stop! I don't want to hear it. She got mad. But I'm telling you everything. I didn't ask. Then she demanded to know what Cassie and I did together.

So I packed my things and left, but now she's begging me to come back. Last Sunday at my in law's house for their 30th anniversary dinner, everything seemed perfect. My wife Emma was helping her mom arrange flowers while I watched the game with her dad. My buddy Josh was there, too. He's been like family since college, always invited to everything. The whole extended family was there, maybe 20 people total. Emma's cousins, her weird Uncle Dave who likes vintage spoons. Her grandmother, who still asks when we're having kids even though we've been trying for three years. After dinner, her Aunt Linda starts this thing where everyone shares their sliding door moments. Those what if scenarios that keep you up at night. Everyone's going around the table sharing cute stories. Her cousin Sarah talks about almost moving to Japan to teach English. Uncle Dave mentions nearly buying Bitcoin in 2,010. Her brother Tom jokes about almost joining the military instead of becoming an accountant. Normal, harmless stuff that gets people thinking. Then it's Emma's turn. She's had a few glasses of wine, and she gets this dreamy, distant look in her eyes, like she's somewhere else entirely. Honestly, she says, looking directly at Josh across the table, I sometimes think I should have dated Josh instead of Mark back in college. We just click so naturally, you know, the entire table goes Dead silent. Her dad literally chokes on his coffee and starts coughing violently. Her mom drops her fork with a loud clatter. Her grandmother's mouth falls open. I'm sitting right there like a complete idiot, watching my wife of eight years fantasize about my best friend in front of our entire family. Josh's face goes bright red. He starts stammering something about how that's not appropriate. But Emma just keeps going like she's in some kind of trance. I mean, we have so much more in common than Mark and I. I do. Josh actually listens when I talk about my art projects. He gets my sense of humor. He remembers little things I say. Sometimes I wonder if I settled too quickly. That last part hit like a freight train. Settled? After eight years of marriage, two miscarriages, buying our first house together, and me working overtime to pay for her art supplies, I settled. I excused myself to the bathroom. But really, I just sat in my car for 20 minutes trying to process what had just happened. My hands were shaking. I called my brother Mike, but couldn't even form words to explain. When I came back inside, everyone was pretending nothing happened, making awkward small talk.

Last Tuesday, I was making lunch for my kids when my phone rang. Unknown number, but I picked up anyway. Big mistake, right? This guy with a thick accent starts telling me he's from the IRS and I owe $4,200 in back taxes. As if I don't pay immediately with gift cards, the police will arrest me within an hour. Now, here's the thing. I literally just got my tax refund two weeks ago. My accountant, Beth, handled everything perfectly and I even got money back. So I knew this dude was full of it. But instead of hanging up, something clicked in my brain. My neighbour, Missus Kim, had fallen for this exact scam last month and lost $800. Time for payback. I started crying into the phone, oh, no, I can't go to jail. My kids need me. The scammer ate it up. He told me to go to target and buy iTunes gift cards worth $2,000 as a first payment. I said I needed an hour to get the money together. First, I called my cousin, Jake, who's a cop, told him what was happening and he said to keep the guy on the line as long as possible. Then I started my revenge tour. I called the scammer back an hour later sobbing. I'm at target, but I'm so confused. Which gift cards do I buy? He walked me through it step by step. I pretended to be this helpless Single mom who didn't understand technology. Sorry, can you repeat that? My hands are shaking so bad. For the next 20 minutes, I wandered around target asking him questions. Do I need the physical cards or the digital ones? The cashier is asking for ID is that normal? Sorry, my 4 year old is having a meltdown in the cart. Finally, I told him I had the cards. He was so excited, probably thinking about his commission. I read him the first number. Okay, it starts with 5. Wait, is that a 5?

I painted it. I was standing in front of my largest piece at the gallery opening, champagne in hand, when a man in an expensive suit approached and started explaining my own painting to me. He had no idea I was the artist because the placard said Riley Turner, who he clearly assumed was a man since he kept talking about his brilliant technique. This guy, Robert, looked me up and down and said, you seem young to be at an opening like this. Let me guess. Looking for a rich boyfriend, smart girl, lots of wealthy men here. He gestured at my painting like he owned it. See, what Riley is doing here requires years of training to appreciate. You probably just think the colors are pretty. The average woman just sees decoration. I took a sip of champagne and said, interesting perspective, which I guess he took as encouragement. Robert moved closer to the painting, physically stepping in front of me and continued his lecture. A girl like you probably thinks this is just nice to look at, but there's actual intelligence behind it. The artist is obviously a man because women simply don't have this kind of technical mastery. Female painters do flowers and feelings. This has real intellectual depth. It's biological, really. Men are just more capable of this level of abstraction. When I mentioned I was familiar, With the artist's work, Robert laughed and patted my shoulder. Following him on Instagram to look at the pretty pictures doesn't count as being familiar with art, sweetheart. You probably think you're cultured because you went to that Van Gogh light show. Real knowledge comes from decades of study, not whatever you Learned from TikTok. Robert decided to test me, rapid firing questions. Who's basket? What's Kiara Scuro? Name three Renaissance painters besides da Vinci. When I started to answer, he cut me off. Wrong. See, this is why galleries shouldn't have open events. You probably googled some terms before coming here to impress men. But Riley here is working in a tradition you couldn't possibly understand without a proper education. Not community college, sweetie, real universities. He returned to my painting now explaining it louder to draw a crowd. What Riley has achieved here would cost probably 100,000 in education to even attempt. The materials alone cost more than you'd make in a month at whatever retail job you have. He looked at my outfit with disgust. Target clearance rack, right? Someone who shops there couldn't possibly grasp the investment in this piece. Probably spent more on one brush than your entire outfit. When I suggested the artist might be self taught, Robert sneered at me. Is that how you Learned about art? Painting parties? Robert grabbed my wrist to pull me to another angle. His grip too tight. You're too stupid to even stand in the right spot. Riley intended for this to be viewed from exactly here. Your ignorance is actually disrespectful to his work. He kept his hand on my wrist while explaining, though honestly, explaining this to you is like teaching calculus to a toddler. You lack the basic foundation to understand any of it. He noticed me trying to pull away and.

I found my work crush share crying in the break room, looking completely stressed. My dad's in the hospital and I need to fly out tonight, but I can't find anyone to watch my kids. My ex won't answer, the babysitter I hired bailed, and I just. I can't afford to miss this flight, but I can't afford anything else either. She leaned against my shoulder, crying even harder. I volunteered without thinking. I'll watch them, I said, heart racing from how close she was to me. Are you serious? It's three kids. Three for at least two weeks. I waved my hand around like a lovesick fool. How hard can it be? The kids showed up at my apartment that night with tons of suitcases. The oldest, around 14, looked at her mom and said, really? Another boyfriend? Cher's face went red. He's just a friend from work. Camilla. The middle one, 10, rolled his eyes. The youngest, seven, wouldn't even look at me, stood in my doorway like they were being sentenced to prison. Cher hug them quickly told them to be good, and left for the airport. I stood there with three kids who clearly hated me and realized I was in way over my head. The first morning, I woke up early to make them pancakes. When the oldest one, Camilla, laughed. She's not here, you know. You can stop trying, she said. Besides, you're not her type. Mom doesn't date guys without kids. We've seen this a dozen times already. It hurt, but it wasn't a lie. Cher's co workers, guys from her gym, men from dating apps. Everyone wanted to play dad until they realized three kids meant actual work. And the kids really didn't make it any easier. From spilling drinks on my laptop to turning the TV up during important zoom meetings, they hated every second with me. Dude, just survive until she gets back, then ask her out. My friend told me that became the plan. Survive two weeks, do whatever to keep the kids happy. Be the hero, finally land a date with share. But like most things, it doesn't always happen the way you want it to. Sometime within the second week, the middle kid, Murph, came home from school trying to hide a black eye. Before I could even ask, Camilla grabbed ice from the freezer and held it against his face. Just pretend you didn't see anything, she told me coldly. I bent down beside them and asked in a kind but stern voice, tell me what happened. Just leave me alone, he said, turning away. I shook my head. I'm not here to lecture you or get get mad at you or do anything without your permission. Not even tell your mom. But I need to know what happened. Murph blinked at me and frowned. Someone called me an orphan because I don't Have a dad! I patted his head and thanked him, walking away as calm as I could, even though all the blood in my body was boiling with anger. Next afternoon, I took a half day at work and showed up at their school in a rented GTR, strikingly white engine, purring like a monster. I rolled down the window and waved, wearing sunglasses and a black polo. Who's got the coolest dad now? I said loudly, as Murph and his friends ran over excitedly. Murph watched his bully's jaw drop and quickly hopped in. He rolled down the window and flipped him off, which was my signal to immediately drive off the middle school campus. Okay, I like the enthusiasm, but let's never tell your mother about this, I said, grinning. I picked up the other two kids and took them to in and out for a quick afternoon snack, then surprised them with a baseball game. Murph ate in a helmet full of nachos, and I managed to snag a foul ball for little Celia. Not bad, old man, Camilla said, watching her siblings enjoy the game. We made sure to take pics with the car and at the stadium, all covered in ketchup and mustard, sent everything to their mom with a caption we wish you were here. After that, things between me and the kids sort of changed. When the youngest, Celia, had a nightmare and called for her mom, I sat beside her bed reading Out fairy tales until she fell asleep. I made the kids meals and lunch box.

I'm thankfully safe using the last bits of data and VPN I have to make this. So let me fully explain what's going on in Indonesia. So the government here is very corrupt and raise taxes by 250%. I believe teachers here are making about $20 a month. So people decided to protest against this as this is wrong and the government and police responded with violence. Police ran over a man with no remorse. I will show some bits of it for clear reasons I won't show the bit where he was run over but the man died and they were also shooting rubber bullets at people. I was looking at what was going on with my aunt and I was hit by a bullet. The bullet hit my leg and it was really painful and I now have a slight limp. But not only that, police started bombing mosques with tear gas, innocent people who just wanted to pray. Now they cut off all internet access and that's why I frantically made my recent video but luckily my aunt had a hot box that switched my internet stuff to be American so I still kind of have access to most stuff but the payment for the box thing is too expensive so I don't know how much I have left. So if I don't post for a while is to save the Data, but I will update soon. Until then, please boost to spread awareness. Even if this video has 0 likes, please just like and comment to boost this video. Bye.

My stomach sank. What bracelet? She pulled out her phone and showed me a receipt. 3,000 dollar custom gold bracelet with your birthstone delivered four months ago. I'd never seen it in my life. My mom suddenly got very interested in her coffee cup. Dad started scrolling through his phone like nothing happened. The air in the restaurant felt thick with tension. Mom, I said slowly, did you sign for a package addressed to me? Her face went red. We thought it was a mistake. Grandma sends so many things. A mistake? Grandma's voice could cut glass. I had it engraved with his name. And track the delivery myself. I watched my parents exchange that look, the same guilty look they'd been giving each other for months whenever grandma brought up gifts or money. I thought I was being paranoid. But now everything was starting to make sense. Show me the tracking information. Dad interrupted, trying to sound authoritative. Grandma scrolled through her phone. Delivered to your front door on March 15th at two forty seven PM signed for by Leora Hensley. She looked directly at my mom. That's you, isn't it, Leora? My mom's hands started shaking. I, I don't remember every package that comes to the house. You don't remember a 3,000 dollar piece of jewelry? Grandma's eyebrows shot up. That's when I noticed my sister's new tennis bracelet sparkling on her wrist. The same design. The same stones, the same everything. My stomach dropped. I'd seen Alara wearing it for weeks, bragging to her friends about how she'd treated herself after getting good grades. Alara's idea of treating herself was usually a five dollar coffee, not luxury jewelry. Alara, I said, staring at her arm. Where did you get that? She yanked her sleeve down faster than I'd ever seen her move. I, um, saved up for it. Alara works part time at a smoothie shop making $12 an hour. She spends most of her paycheck on makeup and clothes. There was no way she had $3,000 saved. How long did you save? I pressed, feeling my anger building. Like a few months, she mumbled, not making eye contact. A few months of smoothie shop money bought you a 3,000 dollar bracelet. Mom jumped in. Alara has been very responsible with her money lately. Really? I turned to my parents because last month she asked me for $20 for gas money. The month before that, she needed $50 for textbooks. Just last week she was complaining about being broke. Dad cleared his throat. Lauren, you're being dramatic. Maybe Alara got a bonus or from a smoothie shop. I cut him off. Alara, what's the most expensive thing you've ever bought with your own money? She fidgeted with her napkin. I don't know, maybe my phone case, which cost like $30. The math wasn't mathing and everyone at the table knew it. Grandma leaned forward her Eyes locked on Alara's bracelet. Show me that bracelet now. I don't wanna take it off, Alara said, her voice getting smaller. It might fall.

There was a decision made by the Supreme Court today that says it is okay for the immigration police to surround large groups of people and take all of them to jail. Normally, the Supreme Court has to give some sort of explanation for this type of decision. In this case, it did not give any explanation. Normally, the Supreme Court members that made the decision have to sign their names to the order. In this case, they did not sign their names to the order. Lower courts had placed significant restrictions on Trump's efforts to ramp up immigration arrests, but now the Supreme Court says no restrictions.

Now my he wants my house. When I was 16, my gaming obsessed brother Tyler convinced my parents I was taking up too much space in our cramped three bedroom apartment. He'd been complaining for months that he needed my room for his elaborate gaming setup. My parents sat me down one evening and basically said I had two weeks to find alternative living arrangements. The reasoning? I was almost 17, practically an adult, and Tyler needed space to pursue his passion in gaming and dreaming. They genuinely believed he was going to become the next big Twitch star. I was devastated, but had nowhere to go. My girlfriend Emma's parents noticed I'd been spending more time at their house and eventually asked what was going on. When I explained the situation, her mom immediately said I could stay stay with them as long as I needed, no questions asked. Emma and I got serious fast. Living under the same roof will do that to a relationship. When we turned 19, I proposed with a ring. I'd saved six months for working overtime every weekend. Her parents were thrilled. They basically raised me for two years anyway and considered me their son. At 23, we finally had enough saved for a down payment on a small two bedroom house. Nothing fancy. We spent every weekend renovating, learning YouTube tutorials, making mistakes and fixing them. Meanwhile, Tyler was still living with my parents in his Gaming paradise. He dropped out of community college after one semester, claiming his streaming career was about to take off. College was just holding him back. Three years later, he was still grinding away at maybe five viewers on a good day. Sleeping until two PM, gaming until 4:00am. Ordering Doordash with my parents money. My parents occasionally texted generic holiday messages or shared Facebook posts about family, but otherwise we had zero relationship. Last month my mom showed up at my house completely unannounced. I hadn't seen her.

My dad showed up at my apartment with flowers for me like I was his girlfriend. And my fiance had to tell him he was my father, not my husband. I always knew my dad was weird about me. When my parents divorced when I was 9, my mom moved on pretty quick, found herself a nice guy named Paul who treated me like a normal stepdaughter. But my dad, he never dated anyone, ever. He'd always say I was his whole world and he didn't need anyone else. At first, it felt special. He'd pick me up from school with my favourite candy. He'd take me shopping and let me get whatever I wanted. He called our Saturday Hangouts daddy daughter dates, which seemed normal enough when I was 10. But things got weird as I got older. When I started wearing makeup in eighth grade, he threw it all away and said I was too beautiful to need that garbage. When I got my first phone, he demanded all my passwords because he needed to protect me from predators. He'd scroll through my texts every night at dinner. High school was worse. He hated all my friends, especially the guys. If I hung out with anyone he didn't approve of, he'd give me the silent treatment for days, just sit at dinner staring at his plate, acting like I didn't exist until I Apologized. The worst was when I told him I was dating Trevor when I was 17. We were driving to target and I casually mentioned I had a boyfriend. He pulled into the parking lot and just started crying, like ugly sobbing. He said I was throwing away everything we had together for some stupid boy who didn't really know me. I felt so guilty. I broke up with Trevor the next week. College gave me some space, but he'd call me three times a day. If I didn't answer, he'd drive the two hours to campus to make sure I was okay. My roommate thought it was sweet at first until she saw him show up at 1:00am because I'd fallen asleep without texting him good night. After graduation, I moved to my own apartment and met Malik at my job. He was calm.

Lights already off, no movement, just darkness where 20 kids should have been. I looked at our teacher and for the first time in my life, I saw her cry. She sat with us, hugged the younger kids and told us it would be okay. But after a while, She got up again and walked back to her laptop. Then we heard it, footsteps running past our door. Thud, thud, thud. I couldn't help myself. I had to look. Two paramedics were sprinting down the hall, pushing a wheeled stretcher, the kind you see on medical shows when someone's heart stops away from the door. Daisy, Missus Harrah whispered, voice shaking. She was scared, too. I sat down and immediately texted everyone what I had seen. Even Missus Harrah stood up slowly and crept to the door to check the window before opening it. That's when it flung open. The principal stood there with an actual cop who had his hand resting on his gun. You, Daisy, come with us. Immediately, my worst fear confirmed. The shooter had sent them or maybe they thought I was involved somehow. Missus Harra looked between them and me, confused. Get your things, honey, Missus Harra said. And that scared me more than anything because in three years of chemistry class, she'd never called me honey. Every single person was staring at me as I grabbed my backpack with shaking hands. The hallway was complete chaos. More cops than I'd ever seen in one place. I heard a paramedic shout, we're losing him. Move as he flew past us. My classmates were pressed against the door windows in every room watching me get us.

I pointed it out and he got so flustered, mumbling something about laundry. Then he looked at me totally serious and said, are you gonna cancel the date now? Like a nervous middle schooler, I fell for him right there, socks and all. Two, we were at the arcade and he got way too invested in the claw machine, not for himself, but because he saw a stuffed turtle. He said, look like me when I'm cranky. It took him six tries, 20 bucks and some serious trash talk to the machine, but he got it when he handed it to me. He said, now you can hold me when I'm not around. That turtle's still on my bed. 3, he doesn't know how to cook at all. But one night I was sick and he showed up with instant noodles, gummy bears and a handwritten get well card drawn in blue pen. He spelled fever wrong, but he also drew me as a superhero, complete with a cape and a little speech bubble that said, I got this. I swear I got better instantly. He made me a playlist titled Songs That Remind Me of You and forgot to check the shuffle setting. First song was Shrek 2 soundtrack. I asked if it was a joke. He panicked and said, no, it's romantic. He really loved her. Five, he tied my shoelace because it came undone and said, safety first, princess, like he was a knight or something. I giggled and he turned red. 6, I caught him flexing in the mirror when he thought I wasn't looking. He whispered, she likes strong arms to himself. I had to pretend I didn't hear so he wouldn't die of embarrassment. 7, we walked past a Lego store and he stopped mid sentence, gasped and said, can we please go in just for a minute? Thirty minutes later, he was building a tiny pirate ship and explaining the lore of each mini figure. Eight, he named a raccoon that lives near his apartment. Captain bites and leaves snacks for it. Every time it shows up, he waves like it's a neighbor. First time I saw it, he said, look, he came.

You ever get betrayed so bad it doesn't just hurt, it rewrites you. That was me. My ex best friend Eli stabbed me in the back in a way I still don't fully understand. We've been close since we were kids, shared everything, laughed until our stomachs hurt. I thought we were brothers. Then senior year came around and I found out he'd been using me. Not in the he copied my homework way. No, this was deeper. He took everything I told him in confidence about my anxiety, my insecurities, my family stuff, my parents messy divorce and used it to build clout with a group of people I thought hated me. Turned my personal life into a punchline. I confronted him and he just smirked and said, grow a thicker skin, dude. It's just jokes. That night I decided to become someone else. It started off stupid. I wanted revenge. Nothing deep, just enough to embarrass him. I made a fake profile of a girl and named her J. It started off small, like turning my pictures into a female version, setting up a fake Instagram. My plan was simple, get him to say some pathetic flirty stuff and then leak it to the school. But Eli fell fast, faster than I expected. And the more he fell, the more I leaned in. What was at first meant to be a two Week job quickly turned full time. By week three, I was using a voice changer to call him. He'd call me every night before bed. Obviously I needed some compensation, so he'd cash app me 10 bucks every call. He'd say stuff like I've never felt this comfortable with anyone. He opened up in ways I'd never seen before. The way he talked to her, the way he needed her. And I started to realize something. He never respected me, but this version of me, this soft voiced, smiling, wide eyed girl from a few towns over, he worshipped her. What started as a joke stretched into weeks, then months. I'd spend hours each day crafting conversations, sinking voice filters, sending selfies, managing multiple burner accounts. I created playlists, family stories, fake college plans. I Learned everything about his insecurities, his fear of being alone, of not being good enough, of being forgotten. And I used all of it. A year in, I realized I'd gone too far. This wasn't revenge anymore. This was something else. I wasn't just catfishing him. I was breaking him and myself slowly and quietly. But the worst part was that I didn't stop. That's when the real revenge started. Jade became distant.

Oh, honey, let me tell you about the time my daughter didn't talk to me for two whole weeks because I betrayed her trust over a damn chicken nugget. So my daughter Lila, she's 14, has the attitude of a Beverly Hills housewife and the budget of a toddler. This girl acts like she's the CEO of the household. Tells me things like, mom, please don't embarrass me in front of my friends. Just stand still and blink like, ma'am, you live in my uterus rent free for nine months. Show some respect. Anyway, she decides she's going vegan. Great. I support her. I buy tofu, almond milk, overpriced plant nuggets that taste like regret. The whole shebang. Do I understand it? No, but I'm a supportive queen. But then one night, it's 1:00am, I'm watching reality TV in the dark, and I get hungry. I open the freezer and see those dino shaped chicken nuggets she begged for last year and never ate. So I pop, like, four in the air fryer. I'm minding my business, living my best life, and guess what? I forget to hide the evidence. Next morning, she walks into the kitchen, sniffs the air like a bloodhound, and goes, did you eat meat in this house? I said, uh, maybe. She gasps like, I just committed war crimes. You ate dead animals while I was sleeping? I said, baby girl, they were shaped like dinosaurs. They're barely meat. Calm down. She grabs her reusable water bottle, slams it on the counter, and yells, this is why the planet's dying, Because of people like you who can't control their midnight cravings! I said, okay, Greta Thunberg, relax. She storms off to her room and text me from down the hall, we're not speaking. This is a betrayal. I text back, fine, more dino nuggets for me. She leaves me on read y'all. Two weeks he wouldn't speak to me. Not even when I stubbed my toe and screamed so loud the neighbours checked on me. She just walked past me with her Hydro flask and judgmental aura. But then get this. One day I come home early from work, I walk into the kitchen, and there she is, standing in front of the microwave holding a plate with three dino nuggets. She's caught mid bite. We lock eyes. Time freezes. She goes, they don't count if they're Dinosaur shaped. I said, excuse me? She wipes her mouth like a criminal and goes, don't tell dad. I said, oh, I'm telling everyone. She bribes me with her leftover Starbucks gift card and begs for mercy. I post the photo in our family group chat anyway. Caption our little activist caught mid murder her grandpa.

It started about six months ago. Every argument, every little thing that didn't go her way, slam. Every time I asked her to do dishes, slam. When I told her she couldn't go to some party where I knew they'd be drinking, slam! The sound would shake the whole upstairs. My coffee mug fell off my nightstand twice from the vibrations. My husband Dave, kept telling me to ignore it. He'd say, kids go through phases. She'll grow out of it. Easy for him to say, since he's usually at work when most of the slamming happens. I'm the one working from home, trying to take client calls while slam! Echoes through the house. The breaking point came on a Tuesday. Emma wanted to borrow my car to drive to her friend Jesse's house. I said no because she got a speeding ticket the week before, and we agreed her driving privileges were suspended. She started screaming about how unfair I was, how I never trust her, how all her friends think I'm psycho. Then she stomped upstairs and slam! But this time was different. This time I heard something crack. Went up to check, and there was a split running down the door frame. The wood was actually damaged. That door had been slammed so hard and so many times that it was breaking the house. I stood there staring at that crack, and something just snapped. In me, I marched to the garage, grabbed Dave's screwdriver set, and went back upstairs. Emma was inside her room blasting music, probably expecting me to yell at her through the door like usual. Instead, I started unscrewing the hinges. It took me about 10 minutes. Emma didn't even notice until I was lifting the door off the frame. Then her music stopped real quick. Mom, what are you doing? She called out. Solving a problem, said carrying her door downstairs to the garage. She appeared at the top of the stairs in her pajamas, mouth hanging open. You can't take my door. I need privacy. You lost your privileges when you damaged the house, I told her. Privacy is earned, not guaranteed. The next few days were interesting. Emma tried everything. She hung a bed sheet across the doorway, which I took down. She moved her dresser to block the opening, so I moved it back. While she was at school, she even tried staying at her friend's house. Jess's mom called me asking what was going on. By day four, Emma was sitting on her bed when I got home from the grocery store. No music, no phone. Just sitting there. This is embarrassing. She. What if someone comes over? Then maybe you'll think twice before destroying property. I said I wasn't destroying anything. I was just mad. The door frame says otherwise. That's when she actually looked at the crack she'd made. I could see her face. Change. When she realised she'd actually damaged something. Day seven was when things got real. Emma's boyfriend Tyler came over to work on some school project. I watched from the kitchen as he walked upstairs, expecting to go into her room and

He thought it was funny. Some 14 year old troll with greasy fingers and too much time.

I'm quitting because I peed the bed and logged out like he won. Cute. So I pulled on my hoodie, cracked my knuckles, and logged into his real life. Step 1 trace the rat. He used a VPN, but he forgot his Roblox was linked to an old Gmail. And that Gmail was tied to a Pinterest account which had his mom's full name, school photos, and boom. Home address. Kid's name Ethan Carter Suburban Software. Plays both Roblox and piano. But guess what Ethan? I play god. Step 2 enter the matrix. I spooked his school's IP, sent every computer in the lab a virus that played a deep fake video. Hi, I'm Ethan and I kiss my cat on the lips. He got detention, but I was just getting started. Step 3 Roblox wrecking ball. I made a new game just for him. Private server, custom map. Looked like his childhood bedroom, except the walls bled and every NPC whispered give it back Ethan! Even his Avatar looked like him, but melting. He joined, lasted 13 seconds before logging out. Blocked me, but I had already planted something special. Step 4 real life payload. I emailed his church. Yes, found it through his mom's Facebook with screenshots of his discord DMS.

I nearly choked on my cereal because that was not a conversation I wanted to have at 8:00am on a Tuesday. It's not what it looks like, I said quickly. But Jake was already scrolling through my transaction history with his eyebrows raised. Really? Because it looks like you're getting paid every Friday for the past three months by someone whose contact name is literally Sugar Daddy. Mike with money bag emojis turned his phone toward me showing the evidence. Are you seriously doing that kind of work without telling me? I grabbed my phone back, my face burning red. Jake, I swear to God it's not what you think. Mike is my boss at the pet sitting company. He stared at me like I'd grown a third leg. Your boss pays you through Venmo and you call him Sugar Daddy Mike? I realised how absolutely insane this sounded, but it was the truth. The company payroll system has been broken for months. So Mike pays all the employees through Venmo. And I saved his contact as Sugar Daddy Mike as a joke because he's always buying us coffee and treats for the dogs. Jake was not buying this explanation at all. That's the most ridiculous cover story I've ever heard. Look, I'll prove it. I called Mike right there in our kitchen. He answered on the second ring with his Usual cheerful voice. Hey, kitten, you're not scheduled until this afternoon. Everything okay? I put him on speaker. Mike, my boyfriend, thinks we're having some kind of inappropriate relationship because of how you pay us and how your name shows up in my phone. Mike burst out laughing. Oh, no, not again. This happened with my daughter's boyfriend last month. He thought she was cheating on him with her sugar daddy Mike. He explained to Jake that his payroll company had been hacked six months ago, so he'd been paying everyone through cash apps. Jake still looked skeptical. But why Sugar Daddy Mike? Mike laughed even harder. Because I spoil my employees and the pets rotten. Free coffee every day, premium dog treats, bonuses for good work. The girls started calling me Sugar Daddy Mike because I'm always buying supplies and treating them like family. He invited Jake to come by the office to meet the team. You can meet the other four dog walkers who probably also have me saved as Sugar Daddy Mike in their phones. I could see Jake starting to believe the story, but he was still embarrassed about jumping to conclusions. This is why you should have just told me you had a job, he muttered. After we hung up with Mike, Jake apologized profusely. I should have just asked you directly instead of making assumptions. But then he got curious about other things. Wait, if you're only making $250 twice a month, how are You paying for all those expensive dinner you've been getting delivered? My stomach dropped because I've been hoping he wouldn't notice my Doordash habit. That's a different situation, I said, trying to change the subject. But Jake was already connecting dots. Please tell me you're not actually doing sugar daddy stuff on the side to pay for food. I just waved it off and tried to ignore him for the rest of the day. The next day, I brought Jake to the pet sitting office to meet Mike and prove my story. He was exactly what you'd expect, 50 something guy in dog hair covered clothes who immediately offered us both coffee and dog treats to sample. See, he said to Jake, total sugar daddy behaviour but completely innocent. The other employees confirmed that they all had similar contact names for Mike and that he was basically the most generous boss ever. Last month he paid for my dog's vet Bill when I couldn't afford it, one coworker said. Jake felt terrible for assuming the worst and bought lunch for the whole pet sitting crew as an apology. I watched too much true crime, he explained to Mike. When I saw those payments, my mind immediately went to the darkest possibility. Mike laughed it off and said it happened more often than you'd think. My wife gets suspicious, looks at the bank when she deposits checks made out to Sugar Daddy, Mike's Pet Care. That night, Jake finally relaxed, convinced Everything was fine. But when I checked my phone before bed, another 500 dollar transfer came in. The message read, good job. He bought every word.

And it doesn't matter. Like, bro, real friends don't need to be in the same classroom or even the same postcode to stay tight. You could be across the city in a different uniform learning completely different subjects, but somehow the bond never fades. Everyone else is like, oh, if you don't go to the same school, you'll drift apart. Nah, bro, not us. I could be sitting in math class stressed out over equations I'll never use in life, and you're across town doing science experiments and we're still texting dumb memes like we saw each other five minutes ago. And when we do link up on the weekend, it's like we never left. No awkward vibes, no weird energy, just straight vibes, bro. We might not be in the same school, but we've got the same mindset, same humour, same jokes, same energy. And the best part, when you meet their school friends and suddenly you feel famous, like, oh, you're that friend they always talk about, yeah, that's me. I don't even go here, but I run this friendship. So if you've got a friend that's in another school but still feels closer than anyone in your class, appreciate that. That's real friendship. Forget proximity. It's about loyalty.

My husband came home from work last Tuesday with this look on his face that I knew meant trouble. He'd been on the phone with his ex wife all afternoon about Caleb. His 24 year old son. Caleb had overdosed again. Fourth time this year. And this time they found him passed out in some gas station bathroom with a needle still hanging out of his arm. I was making dinner when my husband sat down at the kitchen table and just stared at me. My daughter Emma was upstairs doing homework. Completely unaware of what was about to happen. He cleared his throat and said they needed $30,000 for an impatient rehab program. 60 days. Some fancy place up in the mountains that supposedly had better success rates. I stopped stirring the pasta sauce and turned around $30,000. We'd already blown through almost $14,000 on outpatient programs that didn't work because Caleb either didn't show up or relapsed the second he got out. I'd personally paid a thousand bucks for his first detox, thinking maybe this time would be different. Then my husband paid 6,005 hundred for another program. Then we split another sixty five hundred when Caleb swore on his dead grandmother's grave that he was ready to get clean. Here's the thing about Caleb. He'd stolen my wedding ring, my mother's jewellery, our T V, Emma's laptop, and even loose change from Emma's piggy bank. The Kid had no problem looking a 15 year old girl in the eye and taking her birthday money. And every time it was the same story. He was sorry, he was gonna change. He just needed one more chance. So when my husband said they wanted to use Emma's college fund, I actually laughed. Not because it was funny, but because I couldn't believe he was serious. That money came from Emma's dad, who died when she was 6. Her grandparents had been putting money in there since she was born. $180,000. That was meant to get her through whatever college she wanted without debt. Emma's crazy smart. Like, scary smart. Her teachers keep telling me she could get into Harvard or Yale if she keeps her grades up. But even with scholarships, those schools cost a fortune. And our incomes too high to qualify for financial aid. That money was supposed to be her safety net, her ticket to whatever future she wanted. I told my husband, absolutely not. The fund was off limit.

Well, I decided to take things a step further. One night while I was in sixth grade, I decided I really did not want to go to school the following day. Unfortunately, my mom was really strict about missing classes. According to her, I was not allowed to miss any days unless I was on my deathbed. Being a genius 11 year old, I decided to look up how to get a fever. I tried everything from taking a cold bath to standing under the fan. Any of the other regular getting sick ideas I could find, I tried. Nothing seemed to be working. I did more research when I came upon a very promising tutorial. All I had to do was take a bath at the hottest temperature. My bathtub would go in and stay up all night. I figured since I tried so many things already, this last shot in the dark couldn't hurt. Boy, was I wrong. I started the water for a steaming hot bath. It stung to get in it, and my skin was getting red and irritated. However, at that time, I believed it was a normal sensation. In my mind, I convinced myself I just needed to give my body time to acclimate to the temperature. Similar to how a cold bath becomes more bearable the longer you stay in it. Unfortunately, my body never adapted to the heat. Thinking back, it was Definitely way too hot to be in. But for some reason, I was determined to skip school. Miraculously, I survived the piping hot bath for 30 whole minutes.

Well, I'm going to use it even more. I lived in this townhouse for three years with my husband and our two 60 pound dogs. The weird thing is I hadn't been in my own backyard for like two whole summers cause of what happened before my neighbours moved in about 3 years ago, I got attacked by this random dog while I was walking home from work. The thing just came out of nowhere and went up my leg. I ended up needing stitches and everything. But the worst part was how messed up it left me mentally. I couldn't even look at unfamiliar dogs without having a panic attack. Right after I got attacked, these new neighbours moved in next door. They had 4 dogs, three tiny Chihuahuas and one Australian Shepherd. These weren't normal dogs, though. The second they heard any noise from my side of the fence, they charge over and start barking like they wanted to kill something. It was insane. Every time I tried to go outside with my dogs, their pack would go absolutely nuts. They'd slam against the fence growling and carrying on for like 10 minutes straight. My dogs are super chill and well trained so they just ignore it. But I couldn't handle it. The sound would trigger my panic attacks instantly. For two years, I basically gave up my backyard. My husband thought I was being dramatic, but he Didn't understand what it felt like to have your heart racing every time you heard barking. I spent like $1,000 on therapy sessions trying to work through the trauma. Finally, this spring, my therapist helped me get to a point where I could be around strange dogs again. Was so excited to actually use my yard. The first weekend I went out there, I had this routine worked out. When their dogs came outside, I'd bring mine in for a few minutes until theirs calm down, then let mine back out. It wasn't ideal, but whatever. Last Sunday, I was playing fetch with my dogs when the neighbors let theirs.

I worked at McDonald's for three years and discovered the real reason the ice cream machine is always broken. It's not broken. It's rarely actually broken. It's a combination of deliberately terrible design, corporate contracts and employees who've given up fighting a system designed to fail. But one summer, I decided to become the ice cream vigilante my store needed and it nearly got me fired. The Taylor C602 ice cream machine is a nightmare. Wrapped in stainless steel, it takes four hours to clean. And if you mess up even one step, it locks you out completely. The cleaning cycle must be done daily. But here's the kicker, it can only be done by someone trained on that specific machine. The training takes eight hours and cost the franchise owner $600 per employee. Most stores train one, maybe two people. So when Jeremy, our only trained ice cream technician, quit to focus on his Soundcloud career, our machine became permanently broken. The owner, Mister Chen, refused to pay for more training. Just tell customers it's broken, he said. Soft serve has the lowest profit margin anyway. For two months, I watched disappointed kids press their faces against the window, watching other people get ice cream at the Dairy Queen across the street. I watched elderly customers who driven specifically for a cone leave empty handed. One regular, Missus Patterson, came every Sunday for a vanilla cone. After church, she stopped Coming all together, I decided to fix this. I found the C602 manual online, all 296 pages of it. I studied it like my life depended on it. I watched YouTube videos of rogue McDonald's employees demonstrating the cleaning cycle. I Learned that Taylor, the manufacturer, had created a monopoly where only their technicians could repair the machines, charging franchises thousands for simple fixes. I started coming in three hours early, unpaid, to practice the cleaning cycle. The machine was like a puzzle designed by someone who hated both.

I giggled nervously. Um, yeah. Why? No, no, no, no, no. She suddenly screamed while walking as far away from me as possible. I just laughed because moms can be so weird sometimes. But the next day, my daughter came home from school crying, Mommy! Leah said her mom said she can't talk to me anymore. Leah was her best friend. I immediately took out my phone and texted her mom, asking if everything was okay. No response. I texted Emily's mom, one of the other girls in her trio. Still nothing. I had just managed to calm my baby girl down when the pizza arrived. Usually our delivery guy is the apator 5,000. But tonight he just set the box on my doorstep and practically ran away. George, you forgot your tip! I yelled, waving a 20. He just kept going. The next few days were insane. At my daughter's soccer practice, Helen saw me walking towards her and held her phone to her ear. No one had even called her, Helen, what's going on? She mouth sorry and walked faster. We used to complain about our husbands together. Parents were whispering and showing each other something on their phones. When I walked by, they quickly put them away. By Thursday, my daughter was refusing to go to school. I moved my desk away from everyone else. The teacher, Said it was for space reasons, but there's like 10 feet between me and Leah now. I tried to bring her to the hairdresser to cheer her up, but when the woman saw me coming, she closed early. No apology. Just flipped the sign and pulled the blinds. My phone buzzed. It was my landlord. Heard what happened. So sorry. Rent can wait this month. This was the same man who charged me a fifty dollar inconvenience fee when I paid rent at 12:00am instead of midnight.

Emily is my best friend. Enough was enough. I called the school office. Something is happening to my daughter. She's being systematically excluded and I need answers right now. The counselor called back within an hour, but her voice was off, like she was choosing every word carefully. Missus Callahan, we just wanted to check in about your home environment. Is everything safe? Anyone new spending time around your daughter? What? What are you even asking me? I think it's best if we discuss this in person. Can you come in tomorrow morning? No. You'll tell me right now why my daughter is being tortured. Long pause. The principal will explain everything tomorrow. Beep. She hung up. Then at eleven PM, an email from my gym membership. Terminated, effective immediately. I've been going there for five years. The owner knew me by name.

I checked my daughter Kate's bank account and saw zeros where $300 should have been. Kate was 16 and worked 20 hours a week at a burger place. But somehow her entire paycheck had vanished. When Kate got home from her shift, I confronted her with the statement. I've been buying stuff for Zoe at school. She has a baby and nobody helps her, she explained. My first thought was that someone was running a sob story scam on my naive daughter. But Kate insisted that Zoe desperately needed help and the baby suffer without it. The next morning, I gave Kate extra cash and told her to give it to Zoe. Thanks, Mom. Zoe's going to cry when I give her this. That afternoon, I got a call from the school. We need to discuss something serious with you about Kate. Immediately, I rushed to the school expecting the worst. Your daughter was seen in the parking lot giving another student prescription bottles and cash and what appeared to be a substance deal. We have zero tolerance for substances on school property and we've already contacted the school resource officer. He turned his computer screen toward me to show the security footage of Kate hand things Zoe two orange prescription bottles and money by her car. I felt sick realizing I've been giving Kate money that might have been funding prescription substance stealing. Mr Hayes said Kate claimed the prescriptions were antibiotics and diaper cream for a baby, but that sounded like a ridiculous lie to cover up selling pills. No teenager carries around multiple prescriptions for a baby they don't have, he said while shaking his head. That's when the school nurse walked in carrying baby who was coughing so hard his tiny body shook with each breath. This is Zoe's son, she said quietly while patting his back. She brought him to my office this morning because he ran out of his breathing medicine and she didn't know what else to do. The principal went completely silent. The nurse explained that Zoe was 16 and had been trying to finish school while raising a six month old baby.

Her little sister, maybe 5, was sitting in the corner clutching her stomach. How long do you play this game? I asked. Keep in my voice light. My record is three days, Ava beamed with pride.

That's impressive, I said, trying to keep my voice steady. Do you play this game a lot? Every week, sometimes twice. If we've been bad, like when I forgot to clean my room, I had to play for four days. Four days is a really long time without food, I said, watching her stuff crackers in her pockets.

He went to live somewhere else. Daddy said he was too weak for our family. Ava, when did you eat last? I asked casually, like we were discussing the weather. She counted on her fingers. Tuesday, daddy says, I'm getting stronger. It was Saturday. This child hadn't eaten in four days and was proud of it. I noticed Millie's.

Now I have to choose between them. I'm at the vet's office with king, my 14 year old golden retriever. And the vet's showing me X rays on her computer screen. There's a tumor pressing on his spine, dark mass, size of a golf ball. Without surgery, he has maybe two weeks. With surgery, maybe three more years. The vet points at the X ray and all I can see is a countdown clock. The surgery costs $15,000. I look at my phone, my bank account shows barely 16 thousand. That's all my emergency money. Here's the thing, my daughter Lizzie is in a wheelchair. Two years ago a neighbor's dog broke its chain and went after her. King jumped between them. The other dog bit king's shoulder and neck bad, but he didn't stop protecting Lizzie until hell came. She lived because of him, but the attack hurt her spine. She can't walk anymore. Last month we found a doctor who does a special surgery, growth plate surgery. It could help her walk again, really walk. But it only works while kids bones are still growing. Lizzie turns 14 in three months after for that, her growth plates close and it's too late forever. The surgery costs $15,000. Insurance says no, won't pay anything. The vets waiting for an answer about king. My hands won't stop shaking. I'm looking at this dog who saved my daughter's life who still has scars on his Neck from protecting. Now he's dying. And I have exactly enough money to save him or exactly enough money to help my daughter walk. Not both, the vet says quality of life. But all I hear is choose between the one who saved her and saving her future. Lizzie's at school right now in her wheelchair. She carries around a picture of king to show anyone she meets and calls him my hero. She doesn't know we're here at the vet. Doesn't.

I said, you're right, I shouldn't, and pulled out my phone to cancel the 18 thousand dollar wire transfer I'd scheduled for tomorrow morning. Let me rewind. My younger brother ash is getting married next month to Leah, this pharmaceutical sales rep who thinks anyone without a master's degree is beneath her. Three nights ago, I'd gone to the bank and arranged to pay off the remaining $18,000 on Ash's truck as a wedding gift. I was going to surprise him at the wedding, make this whole speech about new beginnings, no debt holding them back. I should have just known better, especially when Leah insisted on this intimate groomsman dinner at some pretentious fusion place where they serve foam instead of actual food. The other groomsmen were all Leah's picks. Winston, an investment banker who wouldn't shut up about his portfolio. Joshua, a medical resident who kept reminding everyone he was almost a doctor. And Markie, who allegedly ran a startup but seemed to just spend daddy's money. The judgment started before the appetizers arrived. So cold, Winston smirked. Looking at my calloused hands, ash says, you work construction. It must be nice having such simple work. No spreadsheets, no thinking, just lifting heavy things. Joshua chimed in next. Didn't you drop out of community college? How do you even read blueprints without an education? The table chuckled. I Tried explaining. Actually, I own the company now. We just landed a municipal contract. Markey cut me off laughing. Right, you own it. Reconstruction guy claims they run their own business when they're really just picking up day labor. Leah wrinkled her nose. Is that why you smell like that? I thought something was off. It's like sweat and tar. The insults kept getting sharper as I watched my brother just sit there, not even trying to stop them. You know what's pathetic, Joshua said after wine had loosened his tongue. You're 32 doing a job the teenagers do for summer cash. My 16 year old nephew could do what you do probably better, too. Winston piled on. How much could you possibly make, 30 grand a year? I make that in a month, man. It's actually sad. My brother ash finally decided to speak up, but not to defend me. He just.

She still thinks she's learning how to flirt. Trish started working at my waitressing job five months ago and from the moment she saw my boyfriend Kao, she set her eyes on him like he was the last Infinity Stone. He was half Japanese like me, meaning we related on a deep level. And for some reason, Trish hated this the most. The first time she saw us having lunch, she made herself comfortable in my seat next to his. When I got up to use the bathroom, she pressed her hips against his and flashed a flirty smile before saying konichiwa. When he awkwardly set it back, she grabbed a pair of chopsticks and started eating noodles unsuccessfully complaining about whitewashed girls appropriating his beautiful culture, very obviously referring to me. When I came back from the bathroom, she told me to grab a chair, telling me I was welcome to join in on their conversation. It definitely struck a nerve, but I was so secure in kaido and his relationship, I didn't even mind until Trish started trying to implode us. She'd corner him when I wasn't looking and tell him innuendo style phrases in Japanese that she got off Google Translate. Whenever we were talking, he always squeeze past us very slowly, sometimes making sure to rub her behind against Kaido and other times facing him directly and giving him the F me Eyes. The thing that really made me mad was when she asked Kaido to come teach her Japanese at her house after work. I was going to confront her there and then, but we were in the middle of a very busy service and I told myself, I do it right after big mistake. You see, at some point during service, these important Japanese business men came in for food. They were at my section, but Trish practically shoved me aside to serve them. Please speak Japanese. I understand everything, she told them. They looked pleasantly surprised and started rattling off their order with specific modifications and allergies. Trish just kept saying, hi, hi, while scribbling nonsense. 45 minutes later, it was chaos. One guy got served the wrong starter. Another received two sushi orders instead of his chicken chow Mein. And the third guy actually started having an allergic reaction to shellfish, which he asked to exclude. That's when Trish.

My husband came home from work last Tuesday with this look on his face that I knew meant trouble. He'd been on the phone with his ex wife all afternoon about Caleb, his 24 year old son. Caleb had overdosed again, fourth time this year. And this time they found him passed out in some gas station bathroom with a needle still hanging out of his arm. I was making dinner when my husband sat down at the kitchen table and just stared at me. My daughter Emma was upstairs doing homework, completely unaware of what was about to happen. He cleared his throat and said they needed $30,000 for an impatient rehab program, 60 days, some fancy place up in the mountains that supposedly had better success rates. I stopped stirring the pasta sauce and turned around $30,000. We'd already blown through almost $14,000 on outpatient programs that didn't work because Caleb either didn't show up or relapsed the second he got out. I'd personally paid a thousand bucks for his first detox thinking maybe this time would be different. Then my husband paid 6,500 for another program. Then we split another sixty five hundred when Caleb swore on his dead grandmother's grave that he was ready to get clean. But here's the thing about Caleb. He stolen my wedding ring, my mother's jewelry, our TV, Emma's laptop and even loose change from Emma's piggy bank. The kid Had no problem looking a 15 year old girl in the eye and taking her birthday money. And every time it was the same story. He was sorry. He was gonna change. He just needed one more chance. So when my husband said they wanted to use Emma's college fund, I actually laughed, not because it was funny, but because I couldn't believe he was serious. That money came from Emma's dad, who died when she was 6. Her grandparents had been putting money in there since she was born, 180,000.

And honestly, watching them at the funeral was the most heartbreaking thing I've ever seen in my life. So my brother Jake and his wife Kelly show up to our house that morning before we head to the church. First thing Kelly does is announce she's pregnant. We're all getting ready for a funeral. And she's like, guess what, everyone, we have news. My mom congratulated her but told her to keep it quiet for today out of respect. Did Kelly listen? Of course not. The second we get to the church, Kelly starts making these loud gagging noises and rubbing her completely flat stomach. Every time someone looked at her, she'd go, oh, sorry, morning sickness, I'm pregnant. You know, she kept saying stuff like, as a mom, I just can't imagine what Rachel's going through, which was ridiculous because Kelly doesn't have any kids yet. At the cemetery, she literally asked Rachel's sister to give up her seat so the pregnant lady could rest her feet. She'd been standing for like 10 minutes total. I was getting so annoyed, but I kept my mouth shut because it's a funeral. After the service, we went back to my aunt's house. Kelly kept making everything about herself. Someone would Mention how hard this must be for Rachel. And Kelly would jump in with, oh, I know. Now that I'm pregnant, I understand maternal instincts so much better. When people were talking about the babies who died, Kelly would rub her stomach and talk about how excited she was to be a mom. The bathroom thing was what really got me. Every time Kelly needed to use the bathroom, she'd announce pregnant lady coming through or baby on board needs to pee. There were like 30 people there grieving and she's treating it like her personal.

She held it up and was like, are you really planning on wearing this in public? With this disgusted look on her face, I was so embarrassed and caught off guard that I just lost it. Told her to please not go through our private Stuff because it was rude and ill mannered. That's when she got all defensive and started lecturing me about how a honeymoon doesn't mean I need to wear revealing clothes on public beaches. She kept going on about modesty and how people would stare. Then she said our relationship and honeymoon wasn't for her to comment on, but she was literally commenting on it. I was getting more and more mad because, like, we're married.

Yeah, I'm sorry. You had a bunch in that pack. I thought it wouldn't be bad if I ate a couple. Cecilia rushed over and grabbed my face, forcing my mouth open. She stared inside like she was looking for something specific and her face went white. We have to make you throw up right now. Why? I thought it was just candy. My voice came out muffled because she was still holding my jaw. She dragged me to the bathroom and started shoving her fingers toward my throat. I pulled away, disgusted and confused, but she kept trying. When that didn't work, she ran to the kitchen and came back with a glass of lemon juice mixed with baking soda. The smell alone made me gag, but she forced me to drink it. Nothing happened except my stomach felt weird and bubbly. Cecilia then tried making me spin in circles. She said motion sickness might help. I spun until I was dizzy, but still nothing. She made me drink salt water next, which tasted horrible and made me cough, but I still didn't throw up. She was getting more desperate by the second. Celia, what's wrong? Just tell me what I ate. I was scared now because she was acting insane. She ignored me and ran to get IPAC syrup from the medicine cabinet, but the bottle was expired and empty. He started Crying actual tears and pulling at her hair. I'd never seen my sister this freaked out about anything. She grabbed my shoulders and shook me, asking exactly where I found the candy and how many I ate. I told her it was in the small round container in her backpack, the one that looked like an Altoid's tin but fancier. She asked what color the pills were and if I was sure I ate them all. I said they were different colors, like some were white and some were pink and maybe one was green. I, I've eaten at least 6 or 7 while gaming because they tasted kind of sweet. My mom heard all the chaos and came upstairs to find Cecilia kneeling next to me by the toilet. What's going on here? Cecilia whispered something in Mom's ear and I watched my mother's expression change from annoyed to terrified in about two seconds. She grabbed her car keys and told me to put on shoes immediately because we were going to the hospital. No explanation, just pure panic on both their faces. The car ride was the scariest 15 minutes of my life. Cecilia was crying in the passenger seat and kept saying, I'm so sorry, mom, I'm so, so sorry. I didn't think he'd find them. Mom was gripping the steering wheel so tight her knuckles were white. She kept checking on me in the rearview mirror, asking if I felt dizzy or hot or if my Heart was racing. I said I felt fine, just scared. And she told me to tell her immediately if anything changed. What's going to happen to me, I asked from the back seat, starting to really freak out. I don't know, honey. Try to remain calm. We're almost there. Mom's voice was shaking and she was driving way over the speed limit. We ran two red lights and mom didn't even care. Cecilia kept looking back at me with tears streaming down her face. She reached back and grabbed my hand, squeezing it tight. That's when I knew something was really wrong because Cecelia never held my hand, not since I was like 5 years old. At the emergency room, mom rushed to the front desk, dragging me along. She whispered to the nurse who looked at me with this shocked expression, he ate them was all she could say, before calling for a doctor immediately. Nurse asked my weight and age while another nurse took my blood pressure. They kept exchanging looks like they'd never seen anything like this before. One nurse asked Cecilia why the pills weren't in a childproof container and Cecilia just sobbed harder. They put us in a room right away, which never happens at our hospital unless someone is dying. Cecilia was still crying and mom kept pacing back and forth. A doctor came in looking very serious with a clipboard and started asking questions. How many did I eat? When did I eat? Them. Did I feel anything strange? I told him I'd eaten maybe six or seven of the small, round pills, thinking they were candy. They were in a little compact case in Cecilia's backpack that looked like mints. The doctor examined me and checked my vitals, then left to talk to someone else. The waiting was killing me, and nobody would tell me what was wrong. A nurse came in and drew blood. Then another doctor came to examine me. They checked my reflexes and shined lights in my eyes and asked if I felt nauseous or different in any way. I saying I felt normal, just scared. They hooked me up to a heart monitor just in case, and the beeping made everything feel more serious. Finally, the head doctor came in and sat down. He had gray hair and kind eyes, but looked concerned. He asked Cecilia to explain exactly what kind of pills I'd taken. You could barely get the words out between sobs. You should be fine. Birth control pills aren't toxic and the dose you took won't cause serious harm. But he's a boy. Boys can't take birth control pills. Cecilia practically screamed. Worst scenario is your brother can't get pregnant.

I'm a family court clerk, and last week the medinas were divorcing and fighting over who gets to keep the house, claiming the other was too financially reckless to own property. Both kept presenting evidence. She bought a year supply of healing crystals for our cat. He bought a boat. We live in Arizona. She hired a life coach for her succulent plants. Mediator Betty looked like she needed a drink at 9:00am. I'd like to hear from your daughter, since she's listed as a witness. Lola walks in dressed like a tiny accountant, dragging two suitcases and a filing cabinet. She looked like she was moving in permanently. Mediator Betty stares at the luggage mountain. Lola, we're just having a conversation. With all due respect, ma'am, you haven't met my parents. You're going to need evidence. Can you tell us about your parents money habits? Lola opens the first suitcase and pulls out a binder. I brought three years of receipts. Receipts? Yes, ma'am. Filed under evidence. My parents shouldn't have credit cards. Betty almost spits out her coffee. Excuse me. Lola opens to a page with colorful charts. I've been tracking their spending since I was 11, ma'am. What kind of spending? Let's start with exhibit A. Lola holds up a bank statement. This is Mom's fourth treadmill. She buys a new one every year because this one will be different. They're all in the garage. We call it The treadmill graveyard. Exhibit B. Dad bought a three thousand dollar espresso machine. He only drinks instant coffee, ma'am. He thought it would inspire him to upgrade. Exhibit C. Mom orders Doordash from the restaurant that's literally next door. Last month she paid forty seven dollars for a twelve dollar sandwich. The restaurant is 40 feet away. An exhibit Dio. Dad belongs to three different gyms because each one has that special machine. He pays $120 a month total. He goes twice a month. That's $60 per workout. Betty is covering her mouth. Lola, how did you start handling the money? Someone had to pay the electric Bill, ma'am. They kept forgetting it wasn't on auto pay. Lola opens the second suit. This is Mom's online boutique phase. She bought wholesale designer handbags from sketchy websites. Our garage looks like a knockoff purse museum. She sold exactly three bags. How much did she spend? $8,000. Made $75 back. The mediator turns to the mom. Mrs. Medina. They looked real in the pictures. Lola continues. Dad's no better. He bought a truck to flip it. He put $5,000 of modifications on it. Damaged LED lights underneath that only light pink. And an attached disco ball inside. It's now worth less than before he bought it. May I present exhibit E. Lola pulls out two jars from the filing cabinet. This jar contains all the warranties dad bought that we've actually used. It's empty. This jar contains receipts for every warranty he's Purchased 83 warranties totaling $4,200. You never know when you'll need them, dad protests. Dad, you bought a three year warranty on a 12 dollar phone case. The warranty cost fifteen dollars. Lola pulls out a credit card Bill. Mom has a storage unit for her Amazon returns she never returned. She's paying one hundred fifty dollars a month to store things she doesn't want. I'll return them eventually. Mom, some of these boxes are from 2,018. What about your father? Betty asks. Dad bought a fishing boat. He gets seasick. He's used it once and threw up. He had to be towed back by a teenager in a kayak. Betty is taking notes quickly. Lola, who manages the household budget now? I do. I changed all the passwords after mom tried to invest in her psychic's nephew's food truck. What kind of food truck? Hot dog sushi, ma'am. Hot dogs wrapped in rice. And dad? Dad bought rental property in another state. He's never seen it. He's not even sure what state it's in. How is that possible? Betty asks. He was pretty sure it was Iowa or Idaho, one of the I states. Lola opens another section from the filing cabinet. This is their joint meal delivery subscription. They spend eight thousand dollars a month on fully catered dinners every night from a service that delivers restaurant meals. They have a 50 thousand dollar kitchen they've never used. The. The oven still has the manual inside. Cooking is Dangerous, both parents say together. Betty shakes her head. Lola, did you prepare all this yourself? Yes, ma'am. What do you think should happen with the money? Lola thinks carefully. They should each get a one hundred dollar weekly allowance. Manage the rest until college. Betty looks at the parents. Your daughter makes excellent points. I'm recommending she control the finances. Lola quietly celebrates. Finally, as we're packing up, I hear Lola tell her parents, I still love you both. You're just really bad at money. Like, historically bad. This kid's gonna run a big company someday.

I saw my six year old daughter standing outside, freezing in the snow. I slammed on the brakes and jumped out of my car. Nora, baby, what are you doing out here? She was shivering violently in just her school clothes, no coat. Tears frozen on her little cheeks. Daddy locked me out. He said, I can't come back until you get home from work. My heart dropped. It was nine PM on a Friday. Jonathan knew I always worked late on Fridays. This wasn't an accident. How long have you been out here? Since you left this morning, she whispered. I scooped her up, feeling how ice cold her little body was, and carried her toward our front door. It was locked. I used my key. Fury building with every step, I. I found Jonathan exactly where I expected. Sprawled on the couch in his boxers and T-shirt, controller in hand, playing call of duty. The heat was cranked up to 75 degrees. Empty beer cans littered the coffee table. Why was our daughter outside for 12 hours? I tried to keep my voice calm. He didn't even pause his game. She spilled grape juice on my new controller this morning, I told her. Actions have consequences. I stared at him in disbelief. She's 6 years old, Jonathan. She spilled juice accidentally and you left her outside to freeze? Maybe next time she'll be more careful around my stuff. That's when I noticed Nora's Pink backpack sitting by the front door. It was stuffed full, bulging at the seams. Her favorite stuffed bunny was sticking out the top. What's this? I pointed at the bag. Jonathan finally paused his game and turned to look at me. There was something cold in his eyes I'd never seen before. I've been doing a lot of thinking today. While she was outside, he said slowly. This whole family thing isn't working out for me. Nor is too much work, too expensive, too loud. And honestly, I never wanted kids in the first place. The room started spinning. What are you talking about? I'm talking about you taking her and leaving tonight. I already had the locks changed while you were at work. You just got lucky I hadn't switched them out yet. I felt like I was in a nightmare. You. You're abandoning your own daughter? Nora was still clinging to me, her wet clothes soaking through my work blazer. She was listening to every word, her big brown eyes darting between us. Here's the thing. Jonathan stood up, stretching like this was all perfectly normal. She's not really mine anyway. I mean, yeah, biologically, whatever. But I never signed up for this dad life. You can have her. The casual cruelty in his voice made me sick. This was the man I've been married to for eight years. The man who used to read Nora bedtime stories. Jonathan, she's your daughter. You can't just watch me. He picked up his phone. I already talked to my buddy Steven, who's a lawyer. Apparently, if I just voluntarily give up my parental rights, I don't have to pay child support either. Win, win. My hands started shaking, but not from fear. From rage. I pulled out my phone and speed dialled a number I'd hoped I'd never have to use. Hi, Christine, it's Caroline. Remember that emergency custody documentation we

When I was 14, my dad surprised me with a laptop for Christmas. I thought it was the coolest thing ever. Finally, I could do school projects, watch shows, and even start writing the little stories I loved. But right after handing it to me, he said, oh, I've installed parental software on it just so you're safe. I didn't think much of it at first. I wasn't doing anything bad anyway. I was googling how to survive algebra and binge watching old TV shows. My dad would casually check my browsing history every now and then, and honestly, it made me feel like he cared, like he wanted to protect me. But then, as high school went on, my world started to get heavier. I made friends who weren't the popular kids, but felt like my people. There was Sarah, who struggled with eating and hated how she looked. Jason, who was terrified of admitting he liked guys, and Lily, who was constantly caught between her parents screaming matches. We weren't reckless. We were just surviving. And the group chat we made became our lifeline. It was the only place we could be raw and real about everything. I remember one night after another anxiety spiral, I typed out, I feel like I'm drowning in school, and I don't know how to tell anyone. My friends responded instantly with love, advice, and stupid memes to make me Laugh. For once, I didn't feel broken. I felt understood. But one evening, I left my laptop open after finishing an essay. My dad went in to make sure it was running okay, and instead, he found our chat. He didn't skim it. He screenshotted page after page. I found out he spent hours reading through months of our conversations. Every confession, every event, every secret. The next day, he sat me down with this grave look on his face and said, I'm worried about your friends. Some of these things sound dangerous. And then, without asking me, he forwarded the screenshots to Lily's mom and even called Sarah's dad. By Monday, the fallout hit. Sarah showed up to school furious, saying her parents were now watching her every bite of food. Jason stopped replying to any of us because he thought someone would out him next. Lily. She wouldn't even look at me. Our group chat was dead. Within days. The safe place we built was gone. My dad told me he did the right thing, that he might have prevented something terrible. And maybe he did. But all I could feel was betrayal. Because he didn't just protect us. He exposed us. After that, I stopped sharing with him. When I cried myself to sleep because of panic attacks, I made sure he never heard. When I felt like I couldn't breathe in class, I pretended I was fine. He could check my laptop, my history, even My texts. But he'd never find the real me again. And that's the thing about teenagers. It's not that we don't want to tell our parents. It's that the moment we feel like we can't trust them with our truth, we learn to keep everything locked away. Even the parts that matter most.

My uncle owned a junkyard in Alabama that had been in our family for 60 years. Then a crypto billionaire bought the land next door and offered us $50,000 to shut down because we were destroying his Zen. Uncle Jim, a Vietnam vet just laughed. Son, I've survived worse than you. The billionaire called Code Enforcement Daily. They found nothing. So we hired a PR firm to tank our Google reviews. Uncle Jim's response, he legally registered the junkyard as a heavy metal concert venue and hosted death metal shows every Friday night. The billionaire built a giant LED wall with nature scenes. Uncle Jim parked 47 junk cars in formation. That spell called out K, a, R, E, N, visible from Google Earth. Next, the billionaire tried bribing our customers not to come. Uncle Jim launched Exotic Pet Fridays. People brought peacocks, miniature horses, even 30 emotional support chickens. Totally legal. The breaking point, when the billionaire's supermodel girlfriend visited, Uncle Jim tested the car crusher for eight hours straight. She left him that weekend. But Uncle Jim had one last card. The Billionaire's mansion was built on a flood plain. First Hurricane season, the whole first floor went under. He sold it at a 3 million dollar loss to a local contractor who turned it into low income housing. Now Uncle Jim host three BBQs for the new families every 4th of July. The billionaire last we heard, he's trying. To buy land in Montana. Good luck with that.

Ava's trying not to laugh. Other students are starting to stare. Lily, no, please. We need to go home right now. But Lily's already flipping to page 2. First, Jake is very clean. He showers every day and brushes his teeth twice, sometimes three times. When he knows he's going to see you, Ava raises an eyebrow at me. I'm dying. Second, he's really good at video games. So if you ever need someone to beat a hard level, he can help. Page 3, he knows how to make really good grilled cheese sandwiches, and he always shares his snacks. I'm trying to grab the presentation, but Lily keeps dodging me. Oh, and this is the best part. She flips to a page that's just a drawing of me and Ava holding hands with hearts around us. He drew this picture of you guys together. Well, I drew it, but he told me what you look like. Ava is full on laughing now. He described me to you. Oh, yes. He said you have pretty hair and you're really smart and you smell like vanilla. I have never said she smells like vanilla, but apparently my sister has a creative imagination. Lily, we're leaving now, but Ava stops me. Wait, I wanna hear the rest of this presentation. This is the most thorough dating resume I've ever received. Lily beams and continues. Jake also writes your name on his notebook sometimes, but he scribbles it out when he thinks people are looking. This is true. And I'm mortified that my sister noticed. He practices asking you to dances in the mirror. I heard him through the bathroom door. Also true. I'm going to die. Ava is crying, laughing at this point. Lily, this is amazing. Did Jake know you were making this? No. It was supposed to be a surprise. I wanted to help because he talks about you all the time, but he too scared to tell you he likes you. The entire library is now watching this disaster unfold. Ava looks at me with this huge smile. Is all of this true? I'm bright red, but I figure I have nothing left to lose. Unfortunately, yes, all of it. She grinned. Well, for the record, I think you're pretty great too, and I'd love to go to homecoming with you. Lily jumps up and down. My presentation worked. I'm the best wing woman ever. Ava leans over and whispers, your sister is adorable, but next time maybe just ask me yourself. We've been dating for 3 months now. Lily takes full credit and introduces herself to Ava's friends as the reason they're together.

My dad banned all cooking in our house after his chef brother humiliated him at Thanksgiving. And I mean all cooking. No stove, no microwave, nothing. He literally removed the power cord from our oven and took it to his office like some kind of kitchen dictate. When my uncle called Dad's attempt to make Turkey shoe leather, his face turned purple. He threw his apron on the floor and said our family would never cook again. Mom tried to reason with him, but he went full butthurt and spent three hours removing every cooking appliance from the kitchen. We were only allowed pre packaged, ready to eat foods. Cold cuts, protein bars, bagged salads with those little dressing packets. Even boiling water was forbidden because that counted as food preparation. For months, I watched my friends eat normal hot meals while I unwrapped another sad sandwich. Kids at school thought I was lying when I said we couldn't even make ramen. The embarrassment was pretty bad. I started getting these dizzy spells during basketball practice, and my legs would cramp up so bad, I'd have to sit out. That's when I realized this wasn't just about Dad's stupid pride. This diet was literally making me sick. I went to the library after school and started researching nutrition. Turns out I discovered my exact symptoms matched severe magnesium deficiency, which made perfect sense. Since processed foods have basically zero magnesium. So I started my own secret operation using lawn mowing money to buy supplements. Within two weeks of taking them, my cramps disappeared, and I could actually finish practice again. I became obsessed with reading ingredient labels, memorizing which preservatives were in everything we ate, because I needed to know what was poisoning me. Slowly, I turned into this weird ingredient encyclopedia. Yeah, knowing every chemical in our entire kitchen, because survival literally depended on it. Then came the dinner that changed everything. Dad's boss was coming over. And this wasn't just any dinner. Dad's entire promotion depended on impressing this man. Plus, if he got the job, he'd travel three weeks out of the month, and I could finally go back to cooking normal, hot food. Dad spent hours arranging fancy the sad cold cuts on our good China, explaining his efficient eating philosophy, while Mr. Keller man looked increasingly uncomfortable. Mom just sat there, silent, dying inside, watching dad serve lunch meat for the most important dinner of

So I'm in medical school, right, cramming for my biggest exam of the semester. Been studying for like a month straight, barely sleeping. My husband Jake's car has been dead in our garage for 3 months now. Every month him and his buddies do this road trip thing. And this time it was his turn to drive. He kept bugging me about taking my car. I told him no way because I have this weak immune system and can't risk getting sick on public transport, especially right before exams. We went back and forth for days. He was all stressed saying his friends would think he ruined their tradition. The morning of my exam, I left at 8:00am sharp. Had to stop at this coffee shop first because our internet at home sucks and I needed to print something. Got to campus around 8:30, went straight to the exam hall. Three hour exam. Felt like I bombed it, but whatever. Afterwards, I hung out with my study group for maybe 20 minutes, then headed to the parking lot. My car wasn't there, just an empty space where I left it. I'm standing there looking around like an idiot thinking maybe I parked somewhere else. But no, I always park in the same spot. My friend Emma was like, dude, your car got stolen. And my stomach just dropped. Called Jake, but it went straight to voicemail. Called again, still nothing Emma. And this Other girl convinced me to call the cops because what else was I supposed to do? The officer who showed up was this older guy, looked like he'd seen everything. He asked me all these questions. When did I last see the car? Did I lock it? Any enemies, that kind of stuff. Then he said I needed to come to the station to file a proper report. So there I am sitting in the sterile police station for four hours filling out paperwork and answering the same questions over and over. My phone's dying. I'm exhausted from the exam and I'm thinking about how I'm gonna afford a new car on a student budget. Around two PM, the same officer comes back with this weird look on his face. He's like, we found your vehicle. I'm thinking, great, some joy riders dumped it somewhere. But then he goes, your husband was driving it. We picked him up about 60 miles out of town. I swear my brain stopped working for a second. Like, what, Jake? I, Jake took my car. The officer explained they pulled him over for speeding and when they ran the plates, it came back as stolen. Jake apparently tried to explain, but they didn't buy it until they called me. I drove to the station to get him in the car. He was sitting in this waiting area looking all defeated, still wearing his stupid road trip T-shirt. His friends were there, too, looking embarrassed. As hell. When Jake saw me, he couldn't even make eye contact, didn't talk the whole drive home. Soon as we got in the house, he exploded, started yelling about how I embarrassed him in front of his friends, how I should have known he took the car, how calling the police was way too much. That's when he admitted he made a copy of my key weeks ago, said he watched me leave for my exam through the window, waited 10 minutes then and took the car. He was gonna text me but forgot because he was having so much fun with his boys. I lost it. Told him he stole my car, literally stole it, made me think I was going crazy in that parking lot, made me sit in a police station for 4 hours thinking my life was falling apart. And his response, it's not that serious. I was gonna bring it back.

My fiance Rebecca really picked the worst time to call me paranoid about her ex, Nate. We were literally sitting there tasting wedding cakes when she brought it up. She kept insisting they were just friends now and I was being controlling. The thing was, I'd come home early from a work trip last week and saw his car leaving our apartment complex at 2 a m. She had no idea I'd seen it. Every time his name popped up on her phone, she'd flip it face down real quick. When she called me insecure again, I decided to call her bluff. You're right. I'm being unfair. Let's invite Nate to your parents anniversary dinner next week, I said. I watched all the color drain from her face. She tried to backtrack, saying her family wouldn't want extra guests their special dinner, but I pushed harder. I'll call him myself to show I trust you. She was trapped, and we both knew it. She agreed, but her hands were literally shaking. That night. I called Nate and made sure to put him on speaker so Rebecca could hear everything. I told him I wanted to apologize for being the jealous boyfriend and invited him to the family dinner. Rebecca just sat there watching me, completely stuck. Tried to turn me down, said it wasn't a good idea. But I Kept pushing, telling him Rebecca really wanted him there. I even offered to pick him up myself, you know, to show there were no hard feelings. When I picked him up that night, the guy was sweating through his dress shirt. During the drive, he mentioned Rebecca's parents hated him, but wouldn't tell me why. We walked into that dinner together, and I swear, the whole room just froze. Rebecca's mom dropped her wine glass, and it shattered all over the floor. Her dad's face went from normal to purple in about two seconds. What is he doing here? He practically growled. I played innocent and explained I'd invited Rebecca's friend to make peace. Her sister actually laughed out loud.

So I became everyone's plus one. My wife Angela walked into the living room holding two wedding invitations while I was watching TV. I need to bring grant to these weddings, she said. Grant was her twenty year old assistant at work. Why grant? I asked, genuinely confused. My whole department will be there if I bring you. Everyone gossips about me playing favorites with him since I'm his boss, but if we go together as co workers, it looks better. She said it like she'd been practicing this speech. Plus, my annual review is next month. My boss will be at both weddings watching everything. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. You're taking grant as your date instead of your husband? It's for my promotion. She waved the invitations at me. You hate weddings anyway. You always complain about the small talk. That was true, but this felt wrong. Fine, I said. Take Grant. Angela smiled like she'd won the lottery. I knew you'd be logical about this. First wedding came around and Angela spent two hours getting ready, trying on three different dresses before leaving with grant at noon. I was sitting on the couch feeling pretty weird about the whole thing, when my phone rang at 2. It was Ryan from my gym. Hey man, you coming to my wedding today? I nearly dropped my phone. Your Wedding is today? Yeah. Didn't Angela tell you? She works with my dad. You're on the list. I looked at the invitation stuck on our fridge, and my heart started racing. She said she was bringing someone else. I told him. So what? I invited you separately. We play basketball three times a week. An hour later, I walked into that wedding feeling like I was about to cause chaos. Angela's face went completely white when she spotted me at the bar, and I'm not gonna lie, it felt pretty good. She basically sprinted over with grant trailing behind, looking confused. What are you doing here? Ryan invited me from basketball. You didn't tell me Ryan was getting married. You didn't ask whose wedding it was. Her boss appeared beside.

My boyfriend Avery told me I was at his apartment too much and needed to give him space, so I stopped going over except for planned date nights twice a week. What he didn't realize was that my constant presence meant I was naturally tidying up while we watched movies, buying groceries when I noticed the fridge was empty, and taking out trash bags that were piling up because I couldn't stand the smell while I was trying to study on his couch. Within three days, his roommate Bart texted me asking if Avery was okay because there were fruit flies swarming the kitchen and something died in the sink. I told him Avery wanted space, and Bart just sent back 17 question marks followed by a photo of their bathroom that looked like a biohazard site with what appeared to be sentient mold growing on towels that had and wet for so long, they'd formed their own ecosystem. Avery's other roommate, Chris, started a group chat without Avery called Eviction Planning Committee and added me to explain the situation. Apparently, Avery had been leaving plates of food under his bed that were attracting roaches, and not the normal kind, but those massive ones that fly directly at your face when threatened. Chris sent a video of him opening Avery's door and literally dozens of roaches scattering while he screamed so loud, the neighbors called campus security, thinking someone was being murdered. The smell from Avery's room started seeping through the walls, and Bart discovered Avery had been throwing dirty clothes behind his dresser instead of doing laundry for two months straight. The pile had gotten so high it was pressing against the heating vent and creating what Bart described as biological warfare through the ventilation system. That probably violates the Geneva Convention. They had to wear masks just to walk past his door, and one of their friends refused to come over after throwing up in their hallway from the stench. I suggested to Avery that maybe I could come over more often again, but he said he was enjoying his independence and finally feeling like his own person. You are making me codependent, and I need to learn to adult on my own, he explained, while I could literally see a pizza box moving in the background of our video call from whatever was living inside it. Chris discovered Avery had been pouring old milk down the bathroom sink instead of the kitchen because he was too lazy to walk the extra 10 feet.

My teacher, Mister Ramsey, stopped his lecture and stared at me. Is that G U M? Everyone held their breath as he marched over to me. Are you eating in my class? Um, it's just chewing gum, sir. Just gum. He took the packet from me and stuffed it into his pocket. If you're going to eat in class, you must bring enough for everyone to share. We are all about Equality here. Now, please spit out the gum you have into the trash can so we may continue our wonderful lecture on the great industrial revolution. The whole class laughed because everyone knows that line. It's what teachers say when they want you to stop eating. It always works. Because nobody was insane enough to actually bring enough to share. So of course, I had to do it. The next day, I showed up with a giant box of chewing gum. 30 packs of Trident Spearmint. Before Mister Ramsey arrived, I placed a pack on each desk, while each person grinned at me with the same oh, you crazy ogre kind of look. When he walked in, all 30 of us were chewing gum, smacking annoyingly all at once. What's going on, sir? You said we could eat in class if I brought enough to share, so I'm sharing. This isn't what I meant. But it's what you said. He couldn't argue with that. And with that, the entire Class became inspired to use the rule to their advantage. My. My classmate Rosemary, whose dad had a food truck, brought in 30 tiny burgers. The smell filled the room, and I swear I heard Mister Ramsey's stomach grumble, no! No burgers, no sandwiches. This is a place of learning. Since we weren't allowed finger food anymore, Benedict brought his mom's rice cooker and thirty pieces of fried chicken legs, all packed in rectangular containers. The smell made students from other classes peek through the door window. Mr. Ramsey looked annoyed. This has gone on long enough. Do not bring any more food.

I told her they usually stayed out until midnight on their anniversary. And she asked if they ever came home early to check on me, which no babysitter had ever asked before. I said, no, never. And she typed something into her phone with this satisfied look on her face. My regular babysitter had gotten sick that morning, so my parents found this girl, Tara, through some neighborhood app who looked normal enough when she showed up wearing ripped jeans and carrying a purple backpack that seemed weirdly heavy when she set it by the door. She kept checking her phone while making me dinner. And when I asked if she was texting her boyfriend, she laughed and said something about how her boyfriend was actually working tonight, which didn't really answer my question. But adults are weird like that sometimes. After dinner, she suggested I play video games with the volume up because she had to make some important calls for her college classes and didn't want to bother me, which should have been my first warning sign. While I played my game, she paced around the living room having a conversation that definitely wasn't about college, unless her professor wanted to know about window locks and whether we had a security system and what time the neighbors usually went to bed. She disappeared upstairs for a while, and I figured she was using the bathroom, but Then I heard footsteps above me in my parents room where nobody was supposed to go. And when she came back down, she had this overly satisfied look on her face. Around 9:30, she stood by the front window texting frantically. And every few seconds she'd peek through the curtains at the street like she was waiting for pizza delivery, except we'd already eaten. Then she turned to me with this fake sweet smile and asked if I wanted to learn a fun new game where I had to stay in the basement for 20 minutes without making any sound, and if I won, she'd give me $20. I pretended to think about it, but my stomach was doing that twisty thing it does when something bad is about to happen. So I said I needed to use the bathroom first and ran upstairs instead. My parents bedroom door was wide open. Their closet light was on. And when I looked inside, I saw she'd moved things around and pulled out my dad's safe from behind his suits and left it sitting on the bed with some kind of electronic device attached to it that was making quiet beeping sounds. There were photos spread out on my mom's dresser that I've never seen before, showing our family at restaurants and parks and even one of me walking home from school, which meant someone had been watching us for who knows how long. I heard footsteps coming up the stairs fast. Barely managed to duck into the hallway closet before she rushed past, muttering something about timing being critical and how they needed to stick to the plan, whatever that meant. Through the crack under the closet door, I watched her feet stop right outside and heard her whisper, listen, you psychopath, I don't care what he promised you. If you hurt that kid, the deal is off and I'm calling the whole thing right now. Whatever she heard next and all the confidence from her voice and she answered, fine, but you get 15 minutes max and then we're gone before the parents suspect anything. She walked back toward the stairs and I realized with this cold, crushing feeling that she wasn't just robbing us, but that someone else was coming and that person wanted to do something to me. And the only reason they hadn't already was because she was apparently the reasonable one in whatever sick plan this was. I waited until I heard her go back downstairs, then crawled to my room on my hands and knees to get my phone from under my pillow where I always hit it during dinner. My fingers were shaking so hard I could barely dial 9, 1 1. But somehow I managed to whisper that someone was in my house and more people were coming. And the operator kept asking questions, but all I could get out with.

My mom clinked her fork against her glass and stood up. Before we sing Happy Birthday to my daughter, I want everyone to know we're also celebrating Moira's half birthday today. My 16 year old sister Moira bounced up from her chair and rushed to stand behind my birthday cake, giggling. Another birthday stolen right in front of me. It's my 18th birthday, I said. Can I have just this one birthday for myself? Mom stared daggers at me. Don't be selfish. Birthdays are meant for sharing and we do this every year. Dad added. Why are you suddenly making it a problem? But that was exactly the problem. Every year I had to deal with my parents putting Moira first. And sure, it was cute back when Moira was three and I was five. I mean, who wouldn't say all when you're top toddler sister helps blow out your candles for the first time. But that was the thing. We were kids. But that cute incident didn't stop there. During Christmas, my parents let her tear open her gifts first before turning around and opening mine too. You're too old to be excited with opening presents anyway, mom said. I was 8. My 10th birthday dinner was at Chuck E. Cheese instead of the Japanese restaurant I wanted. All because Moira threw a tantrum about wanting pizza. My 12th birthday got canceled when Moira woke up with a really Bad tummy ache which happened to suddenly disappear an hour after telling everyone to show up. And on my 16th birthday, my parents forgot all about it. So this year was really it. I was an adult and didn't have to put up with their crap any longer. I looked down at my birthday cake with Moira's name written beautifully and mine squeezed into the bottom corner in sloppy letters, completely misspelled, and just lost it. Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday, dear! I blew out the candles right there. Every single one. Before Moira could make her move, the singing instantly fell apart. Every person in the room went completely silent. What the heck? Moira shrieked. Why did you blow out my cake? Our cake! I said with a smile. I grabbed the presents my parents neatly wrapped on the side for my sister and ripped open the first box. AirPods! Wow! I've been asking for this for four years! Those are Moira's half birthday presents. Mom stood up so fast her chair scraped against the floor. Exactly! I can't wait to share it. I opened another box. Ooh, a Lululemon gift card! Thanks so much! I carefully opened the rest of my gifts, making snarky comments like, oh, Moira, this isn't the color Moira likes. Guess I'll just keep it for myself. You don't mind, right, Moira? All the guests stared at her. Moira started crying, real tears streaming down her face. She's ruining everything! Make her stop! This is what we always do, I said, staying perfectly calm. I don't understand why you're upset. Dad's face turned red. You're going too far. This is cruel. Too far? I looked at him. This. This is exactly what happens at every birthday of mine. The only difference is I'm not allowed to cry about it. Mom's voice cracked, horrified by the sudden public exposure. You're older. You should know better. So when I was five and she was three, I should have known better? You're ruining her special moment, dad said, grabbing the AirPods out of my hands. Her special moment. I burst out into laughter, pointing to the cake. This is my birthday. Moira's is quite literally four months away. Funny how all this sharing stuff only applies when it's my birthday. I mean, go ahead. Name one time Moira had to share her party. Nothing. Complete silence. Yeah, that's what I thought. Last year, her sweet 16 had a professional photographer.

My phone buzzed at 2:00am with a text that made me sit straight up in bed. Remember that favor you owe me? I need you to be my boyfriend at my sister's wedding this Saturday. Pick me up at four PM wear navy. It was from Poppy, the girl who saved my entire college career three years ago. I hadn't spoken to her since graduation when I drunkenly promised her anything, anytime after she spent an entire semester tutoring me through chemistry for without her, I would have lost my scholarship and dropped out. Now she was calling in that favor and honestly, being someone's fake boyfriend for a day seemed like a small price to pay. Plus, if I was being honest with myself, I'd always wondered what it would have been like to actually date her. When I picked her up that Saturday, Poppy answered the door looking absolutely stunning in an emerald dress that made her green eyes even brighter. But her expression was all business. She handed me a typed sheet of paper titled Our Relationship Details with bullet points about our first date, how long we've been together and my supposed favorite things about her. Eight months, she said, adjusting my tie without making eye contact. We've been dating eight months. You call me pop sometimes. We met at a coffee shop. Her voice was mechanical like she was reading a grocery list. During the drive, she explained The situation, my parents keep trying to set me up with their business partner son at every family event. He's perfectly nice, but I'm just not interested. This will shut them up for a while. The whole ride, she was silent. Then when we arrived at the venue, she took a deep breath, grabbed my hand and suddenly transformed into a completely different person. Ready, babe, she said with a bright smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. The ceremony was beautiful. I caught Poppy wiping her eyes during the vows and without thinking, I handed her my pocket square. She looked surprised but took it, whispering thanks so quietly I almost miss it. During the reception, I found myself forgetting this was an act. Her uncle made a toast. I instinctively put my arm around her shoulders. When the music was too loud to hear her cousin's story, I leaned down so she could whisper it in my ear, her breath warm against my neck. Her grandmother cornered us by the dessert table, pinching my cheeks and telling Poppy in a stage whisper, this one's much better than Adrian. Poppy went rigid at the name, but I squeezed her hand and smoothly changed the subject to Grandma's famous apple pie recipe. Couple's dance was when everything shifted. Poppy was stiff in my arms, counting steps under her breath like she was solving an equation. Hey, I whispered, pulling her closer. Just follow me. Stop thinking so hard. She looked Up at me and for a moment, her guard completely dropped. She melted into me, her head finding that perfect spot against my shoulder. We swayed together as the song played and I found myself hoping it would never end. Then during the bouquet toss, she caught it by accident when it bounced off another girl's hands. The crowd cheered, but Poppy immediately handed it to the girl beside her, laughing it off. Just superstition anyway, she said. But I noticed her looking at the flowers longingly as the other girl walked away. Her sister pulled me aside while Poppy was in the bathroom. Thank you, she said, squeezing my arm for making her happy, even if it's just for tonight. The words stuck with me. As the night wound down, I realized I wasn't acting anymore. When I looked at her laughing with her cousins, I felt a pull in my chest that had nothing to do with owing her a favor, driving her home. I couldn't keep it in anymore. Poppy, I know this was just repaying a debt, but tonight felt real to me, really real. She went completely still in the passenger seat when I pulled up to her apartment. She practically jumped out of the car. You did great. Perfect. Fake boyfriend. We're even now. The words came out rushed and cold. She was already at her building's door before I could respond. I sat there for 5 minutes feeling like an idiot before driving. Home. The next morning, Poppy's sister texted me. You left your.

I was always the second choice in my family. My older sister Maya was everything I wasn't. Prom queen, valedictorian, mom and Dad's little angel who could do no wrong. She got designer clothes and a car for her 16th birthday. I got hand me downs and a lecture about being grateful. But I never held it against her. That's just how things were. When Maya turned 25, she got really sick, kidney failure. The doctor said she needed a transplant fast or she wasn't gonna make it. Without even thinking, I volunteered to get tested. I mean, she's my sister, right? Blood is thicker than water and all that. Turns out I was a perfect match, like scary perfect. The doctors kept saying how rare it was, how lucky Maya was to have a sister like me. I didn't feel lucky. I felt terrified. But Maya was lying in that hospital bed looking so small and pale and my parents were crying every single day. So I did it. I gave her my kidney. The surgery was rough, way rougher than anyone told me it would be. I spent two weeks feeling like I got hit by a truck while Maya bounced back like nothing happened. But seeing her smile again, seeing my parents stop crying, it felt worth it. For a few months, I was the golden child. Mom would brag to everyone about how brave I was how I saved Maya's life. Dad actually hugged me for the first time in years. Maya kept saying she owed me everything. I thought maybe things would be different now. But then life went back to normal. Maya got her job back, started dating this rich guy from her college, and suddenly I was invisible again. When she graduated with her master's degree, they threw her this huge party. When I graduated nursing school the same year, they sent a card. Last month, I overheard them planning a family trip to Greece. Maya was talking about some resort she'd seen on Instagram and mom was looking up flights. I got excited thinking about our first real family vacation in years. Then Maya said something that made my blood freeze. Just the three of us, though, right? Like Lena doesn't need to come. She's always been more of a homebody anyway. Mom laughed and agreed. Dad just grunted like he always does when he doesn't want to deal with conflict. We were planning to spend $10,000 on a trip and didn't even consider inviting me, the girl who literally gave up a piece of herself to save their precious daughter. I confronted them the next day. Mom got all defensive, saying I was being dramatic. It's nothing personal, honey. We just need some bonding time. Maya's been through so much. I wanted to scream that I've been through stuff, too. But I just swallowed it like I always do. They left for Greece last week. I saw the pictures on Maya's Instagram, fancy dinners, beach photos, the three of them looking like the perfect happy family. But then something weird happened. My doctor called saying he'd gotten a request for my.

My house is pretty basic, but I got this massive Rottweiler named bear on my front porch. Thing is, people always think he's fake, like a statue or something. Bears, 10 years old and has really bad arthritis. During the day, he literally doesn't move. He'll sit in the exact same spot for like six hours straight. Delivery guys walk right past him. Kids pet him thinking he's some decoration. My neighbor Jake even tried to move him once because he thought I bought some weird lawn ornament. About three weeks ago, this sketchy dude in a hoodie started walking by my house every night around 11. He'd slow down and stare at my windows. I noticed because I work night shifts and I'd see him from my bedroom. He'd count my cars, check if lights were on, the whole deal. What this idiot didn't know was that I used to visit my mom every weekend. We live two hours away and I'd leave Friday night, come back Sunday. But last month, she moved into this care facility nearby. So now I'm home every weekend. Friday night comes around and I'm upstairs watching Netflix when I hear this scraping sound like metal on metal. I mute my laptop and listen. Nothing. Then more scraping. Peek out my window and see this guy with a crowbar trying to Jimmy open my kitchen. Window. He's wearing gloves and everything. Real professional. Bear sitting on the porch like always, completely still. The guy walks right past him twice. So this moron gets the window open and climbs inside. I can hear him downstairs moving around with a flashlight. He's being quiet, but not that quiet. I grab my phone and start recording everything. Spends like 10 minutes in my living room probably looking for my laptop and stuff. Then I hear him in the hallway where I keep my coin collection. My grandfather left me these old silver dollars worth probably five grand. The guys picking the lock on my cabinet can hear the clicks. Bear must have heard it too, because suddenly I see the shadow moving on the porch slowly, like really slowly. Bear stands up, joints cracking, loud enough that I can hear it upstairs. But the thief doesn't notice because he's focused on the lock. Finally gets it open. I hear him whisper Jackpot or something like that. That's when bear moves. He gets up and walks inside through the back door that I always leave cracked open for him. His nails are clicking on the kitchen.

What criminal actually impressed you with their criminal skills? Working night patrol in Seattle, I kept getting calls about a woman stealing from rich people's homes. But this wasn't your typical burglar. She only took one item from each house. Always something the owners didn't even notice was missing for weeks. The really weird part? She'd leave behind expensive jewelry and electronics, taking things like old photo albums or baby blankets instead. It drove me crazy trying to figure out her pattern. And one night, we got lucky. A security camera caught her face as she walked out of a mansion carrying what looks like a teddy bear. When I saw the footage, my coffee nearly fell out of my hand. The thief was Andrea Walsh, one of our city's most respected foster care social workers. I'd met her several times at charity events. She was this quiet woman in her 50s who fostered over 30 kids herself. Everyone knew her as the angel who took in the hardest cases, the kids nobody else would touch. We brought her in for questioning at 3 a m. She sat across from me in the interrogation room, still wearing her cardigan and sensible shoes, looking more like someone's grandmother than a criminal mastermind. Wanna tell me about the bear? I asked. She smiled sadly. That bear belonged to Tommy Jenkins. He 6, now living with his fifth foster family. His birth mom promised to give it back when she got Clean. But she sold it instead. My partner pulled up Tommy's file. Sure enough, there was a note about a missing teddy bear he'd cry about every night. The photo album from the Martinez house, I asked. That belonged to Rosa, didn't it? The teenager who aged out of the system last year. Andrea nodded. Her birth father sold everything when he went to prison. That album had the only pictures of her mother. One by one, we went through every item she'd stolen. Each one belonged to a foster kid she'd worked with, sold off by birth parents for drug money or lost in the shuffle between homes. She'd spent months tracking down these items, studying security systems and planning her break ins. She knew exactly when each family would be away, which windows would be unlocked, where every motion sensor was placed. I tried doing it legally at first, she explained, offering to buy the items back. But most of these families wouldn't even talk to me. So I found another way. She pulled out a worn notebook filled with addresses, schedules, and detailed maps of wealthy neighborhoods. I've got 43 more items to find. Kids shouldn't have to lose their memories just because the system failed them. I looked at my partner. We both knew what we had to do. The evidence against her. With solid security footage, documented break ins, even her own confession, she'd serve serious time. But then I thought about Tommy getting his Bear back. Rosa seeing pictures of her mom again? I accidentally knocked my coffee all over her notebook. Oops. Looks like your list of targets is ruined. Guess we'll never know where you were planning to hit next. My partner caught on quick. Shame about that security footage, too. System must have glitched. It's all corrupted now. We let her go with a warning. Every few months after that, I'd hear about another missing teddy bear or baby blanket. But somehow the security cameras always seem to malfunction on those nights. Last week, I ran into Andrea at the grocery store. She smiled and handed me a small package. Inside was a baseball mitt with my name scratched into the leather. The same one my dad sold for drugs when I was 8. Found this at a pawn shop in Portland, she whispered. Figured you might want it back. I still keep that mitt on my desk.

My son came into my room fully dressed for school and just stood there in the doorway like he was waiting to be punished. I asked what was wrong and he said, can I stay home today? I feel really sad. I don't know why. I just don't wanna go. At first I almost gave him the response I was raised on. Life doesn't stop just because you're in a mood. But the way he said it, it didn't sound like a kid trying to skip class. It sounded like a kid trying not to cry from something much worse. I told him to go sit down while I got ready, then walked into the bathroom and locked the door. I needed a second to breathe because something about it hit too hard. Not the sadness, the fact that he asked. As a kid, I was taught to hide feelings like that, to bury them deep, never speak them out loud, and especially never expect kindness afterward. So I took a breath, came out and told him, alright, you're staying home, but you're not in trouble. And I'm not mad. He kept looking at me like he was waiting for the butt. There wasn't one. We spent the day doing nothing worth posting about. We didn't talk about why he felt sad. I didn't try to fix it. I just let him exist. We made lunch, watched something stupid, and sat on the couch. Like the world wasn't pressing down on either of us. At one point, he looked over and asked, do you ever feel sad for no reason? I nodded more times than I can count. He didn't say anything else, just leaned against me and closed his eyes. That night, while he brushed his teeth, he looked at me in the mirror and said, I thought you'd be mad. Last time I cried, you told me to act my age. I. I didn't even remember saying that, but apparently he did. After he went to bed, I stayed up cleaning the living room. I found his backpack under the blanket he had curled up in, and when I unzipped it to pull out his lunch box, I saw a folded sheet of paper tucked between two math work sheets. It wasn't a school assignment. It was a note written in pencil, erased and rewritten more than once. It said, I don't want to feel this way anymore, but if I tell someone, they'll make me feel worse for not wanting to be alive.

So my brother Jake got married, like, three weeks ago, and the whole thing was basically a slap in the face. His wife Megan, decided nobody under 21 could come because they were serving alcohol and didn't want any minors getting drunk. I was 19 at the time, which apparently made me some kind of liability. The excuse was complete bullshit, and everyone knew it. I don't even drink that much. Maybe a beer here and there with friends, but I'm not some alcoholic teenager who's gonna embarrass their precious wedding. But whatever. That's what they decided, and my parents just went along with it, like always. I asked them to reconsider a few times because, honestly, it hurt. Jake and I used to be close growing up. We shared a room until I was 14, played video games together, the whole thing. But ever since he started dating Megan two years ago, she's basically been calling all the shots. She thinks she's better than everyone because her dad owns some car dealership and she went to private school. After they kept saying no, I just stopped caring. If I wasn't good enough for their wedding, then fine. I wasn't gonna beg anymore. Then last Saturday rolls around, and Jake texts our family group chat saying he wants everyone to go to some fancy steakhouse to celebrate the wedding. My parents Were all excited, talking about how nice it would be to finally celebrate as a family, but I just replied that I wasn't going. My mom called me right away asking why not? I told her the same thing I told everyone else. I didn't see the point in celebrating something I wasn't even invited to. She tried to guilt trip me, saying it would mean a lot to Jake and that my cousins Becca and Tyler were going even though they didn't get invited either. But here's the thing. Becca is 13 and Tyler is 15. Their parents literally forced them to go. They didn't have a choice. I'm 19, I pay my own phone Bill, I work at Best Buy part time, and I'm starting community college in the fall. I can make my own decisions about where I spend my Saturday night. My parents kept trying to convince me all week. My dad even offered to pay for my meal, which honestly just made it worse. Like, you couldn't fight for me to be at the actual wedding, but now you wanna throw money at me to show up to the Celebration dinner? The night of the dinner, I. I stayed home and ordered pizza. I was playing call of duty with my friends when my phone started blowing up. First it was Jake texting me asking where I was. Then Megan sent me this long paragraph about how disappointed she was that I couldn't be mature enough. To support my brother's happiness. Funniest part is they acted all surprised that I didn't show up. I literally told them I wasn't going. What did they expect? After they got home from dinner, Jake came to my room and tried to have some.

Jason, software engineer. Had a golden retriever named Max. Said he loved hiking. We talked for three weeks straight. He sent voice messages, selfies, even videos of him making coffee in the morning. Seemed normal enough. We agreed to meet at this trendy bar downtown called Murphy's. I'd been there once with co workers. Got there at 7 sharp wearing this blue dress I'd bought specifically for the date. Jason was already at a table in the corner. He looked similar to his photos, but something felt off immediately. No glasses like in his pictures. His voice sounded different too. Deeper than the voice messages. Maybe I was just nervous. He stood up and hugged me like we'd known each other forever. Started talking about things. I swear I'd never told him. How my apartment had hardwood floors, how I always put extra sugar in my coffee. Stuff that felt way too specific. I brushed it off, thinking maybe I'd mentioned it and forgot. Then he ordered for both of us without asking. 2 whiskey sours. I hate whiskey. I'd literally told him in our text that I only drink wine or beer. When I mentioned it, he laughed. And said he remembered me saying whiskey was my favorite. The bartender brought our drinks, and Jason immediately started asking about my job. Normal first date stuff. But then he mentioned my boss, Rebecca, by name. I'd never told him my boss's name. Ever. I excused myself to use the bathroom and checked our text messages. Nowhere did I mention Rebecca. My heart started racing. When I came back, he was scrolling through his phone. He looked up and grinned. Said he loved the photos I'd sent him of my childhood bedroom. This stuffed elephant on my dresser was adorable. I froze. I never sent him photos of my room. Never even mentioned a stuffed elephant. That elephant had been sitting on my dresser since I was 7. Nobody knew about it except my family. That's when it hit me. This wasn't the Jason I've been texting. Someone had either hacked his account or been impersonating him the whole time. Worse, they'd somehow been watching me, following me, taking photos of my apartment. Jason caught me staring, and his smile got wider. Ask if I was thinking about ditching already. His tone was too calm, too knowing. I forced a laugh. Said I was just checking the drink menu. My friend Emma had told me about this bar's safety system once. You could order some special drink name, and they'd help you get out. But I couldn't remember what it was called. I excused myself again and walked to the Bar! The bartender

On the anniversary of his passing, I take the day off work, visit his grave, donate blood as he needed many transfusions during his treatment, and then come home to watch his favorite movie. It's simple, but deeply meaningful to me. My girlfriend of nine months, Anna, asked me to join her and her mom for lunch yesterday. Her mom visits often, so this wasn't a meet the parents situation. I reminded her about my tradition and said I wouldn't be able to make it, got upset and said, well, it's my tradition to have lunch with my mom every time she's in town, and she really wanted to see you. You can do your stupid blood donation tradition any day. I was taken aback, but calmly explained it wasn't just about the blood donation. It was an entire day I set aside to remember my brother. Later that evening, while I was watching my brother's favorite movie, Anna texted again asking me to join them. I reiterated that I couldn't and said I'd gladly hang out with her mom another time. She responded that I'd embarrassed her in front of her mom and accused me of being selfish and lazy. Since then, she's been distant and giving me the cold shoulder. I can't help but feel frustrated because this tradition is One of the few ways I've found to cope with my loss. I've always been supportive of her relationship with her mom, so her reaction caught me off guard.

My school installed 5 minute bathroom timers because they thought kids were vaping in there. I'm Ella and I was a junior when our principal announced this genius plan. Every bathroom stall got these little digital timers that started counting down the second you lock the door. 5 minutes and 1 second, boom. Automatic email to your parents and the principal saying you were misusing school facilities. He claimed it was about vaping, but honestly, half the girls in my grade have stomach problems or heavy periods. Imagine trying to explain to your mom why you got flagged for taking 6 minutes to change a pad. Pure humiliation. The first week was chaos. Kids were literally running out of bathrooms with their pants half up because they heard the timer beeping. My friend Jessica got detention because she had food poisoning and couldn't finish in time. The email to her parents said she was loitering with intent to engage in prohibited activities. Her mom thought she was doing drugs. That's when I decided this was war. I grabbed my old walkie talkie from when I was obsessed with spy movies and called up my friends Maya and Zoe. We met at lunch and I laid out the plan. Bathroom relay team. I explained drawing diagrams on a napkin. One person goes in, starts the timer, hands off the walkie at 4 minutes 30 seconds. Next person walks in and takes Over timer resets. Bathroom never gets empty. Nobody goes over five minutes. Maya thought I was insane. Zoe was immediately in. We started small, just the three of us rotating through the second floor girls bathroom. During lunch, I made us a little notebook titled Bathroom Attendance Team, Clean cheeks. We logged every shift change. We felt like secret agents. Day 1 worked perfectly. Day 2, the sophomore named Brianna noticed us whispering by the bathroom door and asked what was up. I figured, what the hell and explained the plan. She was so excited she literally clapped. By day 3, we had seven girls. By the end of the week, it was like 20 kids rotating through bathroom duty. Kids were doing homework by the sinks during their shifts. This freshman named Tyler brought a camping chair and set up a whole study station by the.

What criminal actually impressed you with their criminal skills? Working night patrol in Seattle, I kept getting calls about a woman stealing from rich people's homes. But this wasn't your typical burglar. She only took one item from each house. Always something the owners didn't even notice was missing for weeks. The really weird part? She'd leave behind expensive jewelry and electronics, taking things like old photo albums or baby blankets instead. It drove me crazy trying to figure out her pattern. Then one night, we got lucky. A security camera caught her face as she walked out of a mansion carrying what looks like a teddy bear. When I saw the footage, my coffee nearly fell out of my hand. The thief was Andrea Walsh, one of our city's most respected foster care social workers. I'd met her several times at charity events. She was this quiet woman in her 50s who'd fostered over 30 kids herself. Everyone knew her as the angel who took in the hardest cases, the kids nobody else would touch. We brought her in for questioning at 3 a m. She sat across from me in the interrogation room, still wearing her cardigan and sensible shoes, looking more like someone's grandmother than a criminal mastermind. Wanna tell me about the bear? I asked. She smiled sadly. That bear belonged to Tommy Jenkins. He 6, now living with his fifth foster family. His birth mom promised to give it back when she got Clean. But she sold it instead. My partner pulled up Tommy's file. Sure enough, there was a note about a missing teddy bear he'd cry about every night. The photo album from the Martinez house, I asked, belonged to Rosa, didn't it? The teenager who aged out of the system last year. Andrea nodded. Her birth father sold everything when he went to prison. That album had the only pictures of her mother. One by one, we went through every item she'd stolen. Each one belonged to a foster kid she'd worked with, sold off by birth parents for drug money or lost in the shuffle between homes. She'd spent months tracking down these items, studying security systems and planning her break ins. She knew exactly when each family would be away, which windows would be unlocked, every motion sensor was placed. I tried doing it legally at first, she explained, offering to buy the items back. But most of these families wouldn't even talk to me. So I found another way. She pulled out a worn notebook filled with addresses, schedules, and detailed maps of wealthy neighborhoods. I've got 43 more items to find. Kid shouldn't have to lose their memories just because the system failed them. I looked at my partner. We both knew what we had to do. The evidence against her was solid. Security footage, documented break ins, even her own confession. She'd serve serious time. But then I thought about Tommy getting his bear back. Rosa seeing pictures of her mom again? I accidentally knocked my coffee all over her notebook. Oops. Looks like your list of targets is ruined. Guess we'll never know where you were planning to hit next. My partner caught on quick. Shame about that security footage, too. System must have glitched. It's all corrupted now. We let her go with a warning. Every few months after that, I'd hear about another missing teddy bear or baby blanket. But somehow the security cameras always seem to malfunction on those nights. Last week, I ran into Andrea at the grocery store. She smiled and handed me a small package. Inside was a baseball mitt with my name scratched into the leather. The same one my dad sold for drugs when I was 8. Found this at a pawn shop in Portland, she whispered. Figured you might want it back. I still keep that mitt on my desk.

For me, it was pretending to be fluent in Spanish at my first corporate job. I had taken four years of it in high school and two semesters in college, but I was far from fluent. However, on my resume, I confidently marked bilingual English slash Spanish. It's a tech support role at a software company, and during the interview, they never tested my Spanish skills. I figured the language requirement was just a nice to have that would rarely come up. My first week went smoothly. Then Friday afternoon happened. Hey, Rachel. My manager, Dave, poked his head over my cubicle. We've got an escalated case with a client in Mexico City. Their entire system is down, and they only speak Spanish. Can you jump on a call with them? My stomach dropped. Right now? Yeah, they've been waiting for someone who speaks Spanish. It's pretty urgent. I felt like I was going to throw up. I had two choices confess my exaggeration or fake my way through it. Sure. I heard myself say, send me the details. As I waited for the conference call to connect, I frantically opened Google Translate and typed out some technical phrases I might need. My palms were sweating so badly I could barely use my mouse. The call connected. Hola, departamento de soporte tecnico. A man's voice came through. See? Hola! Me llamo Rachel, I responded, my voice shaking slightly. Cual es el problema What followed was the most stressful hour of my professional life. The client, Miguel, spoke rapidly using technical terms I never Learned in school, caught maybe 60% of what he was saying and pieced together the rest from context. Mastifacio, por favor! I kept saying. Slower, please. I explained that the connection was bad to buy myself time to look up words. When I couldn't find the right technical term, I'd say un momento and pretend to check something in our system while frantically searching translations. Somehow I managed to understand that their server was rejecting authentication requests. Walked Miguel through basic trouble, shooting steps, relying heavily on my technical knowledge while struggling with a language barrier. After about 45 minutes, Miguel exclaimed, funsiona! Es que funsiona LA ora! It worked! I had somehow fixed their problem. Muchas Gracias, Rachel, Miguel said, relief evident in his voice. Tu espanol no es perfecto. What's your problem? I froze. He had just said my Spanish wasn't perfect, but I solved their problem. Gracias, I replied, mortified but relieved. Estoy still learning technical terms after? For hanging up, I expected to feel ashamed, but instead I felt oddly accomplished. I had managed to help someone despite my limitation. Dave stopped by my desk later. Great job with that call. The client emailed saying you were extremely helpful. They've been with us for years, but complained about language barriers before. I nodded, unsure what to say. They mentioned your Spanish needs some technical vocabulary. Work. But they appreciated your effort. Many people would push through a language barrier like that. I smiled weakly. I should probably brush up on my technical Spanish. Definitely. In fact, the company will pay for classes if you're interested. That Monday, I signed up for specialized Spanish courses. Six months later, I was handling all our Latin American support calls with genuine confidence. I still work with Miguel's company. They're now our biggest client in Mexico. And he still teases me about that first call.

I dried my hands. Yeah, last night around eleven PM why? I responded my landlord. Casper's knees buckled and he started hitting his head against the wall repeatedly. Whoa, what's wrong? It's just an extension cord. I reached out to stop him from hurting himself, but he shoved me back with surprising force. He fumbled for his phone with shaking hands. She's gone. Eleven twenty three PM, exactly like they warned me. Tears were streaming down his face as he spoke to someone. Yes, the power was cut. 12 minutes. That's all it took before I could process what was happening. The basement door flew open and Missus Delacqua from the unit below mine came charging up. She took one look at me and screamed murderer so loud my ears rang. What are you talking about? I backed against the kitchen counter, completely lost. She collapsed next to Casper, both of them sobbing. 47 days, she wailed. We kept her alive for 47 days and you killed her in 12 minutes. Kept who alive? What's happening? My phone started blowing up with texts from other tenants. Monster. How could you, we all heard what you did. Cops are coming. The buildings maintenance guy, Tiago burst through my door without knocking. You sick bastard. I told Casper not to rent to outsiders. He had a wrench in his hand like he was considering using it. The Orange cord, he shook his head and just leaf the one that runs up through the PVC pipe that we all check three times a day. It was just an extension cord. My voice cracked with panic. Just an extension cord. Missus Deliqua laughed hysterically. That cord was the only thing between her and death. Casper finally looked at me, his eyes red and swollen. Two weeks you've been here two weeks and you've destroyed everything. I explained the basement rules when you moved in. He was shaking with rage. I showed you the locked cabinet, the medical equipment, showed me where the laundry was. That's it. There was no locked cabinet. I was desperate now. More people started flooding into my apartment. The couple from 3C, the old man from the first floor, even the food delivery drivers who serviced our building regularly. They all looked at me with pure hatred. I delivered her medications just yesterday, the pharmacy tech said quietly. $12,000 worth, all useless now. She trusted us, someone said. She trusted us to keep her safe. We had shifts. Another tenant sobbed, 24 7 monitoring until you came. Missus Delacqua pulled out her phone showing a schedule. Look, your name isn't even on the care rotation because you refused to help. When we asked what care rotation? Nobody asked me anything. Sirens wailed outside. Through my window, I could see three police cars and an ambulance pulling up. But the ambulance didn't rush. The emts moved Slowly, like they already knew it was too late. 11:23, Casper kept repeating, the machines would have alarmed at 11:11 when the power cut. She had 12 minutes of battery backup, 12 minutes of oxygen left. My stomach turned to ice. The humming, someone whispered. He must have heard the machines humming through the ceiling. How could he not know we were so close? Missus Delilah wept. The lung transplant was next week. She just needed one more week. Two police officers entered my apartment. One of them already had handcuffs out. Ma'am, we need you to come with us. I didn't know, I pleaded. There was no sign on the cord, no explanation. How was I supposed to know someone's life support was plugged into a random orange extension cord? Casper's face turned dark. That extension cord ran up through the ceiling to Missus Antoff's apartment. Her granddaughter, Vera, 7, 7 years old with cystic fibrosis. Her ventilator, her oxygen concentrator, her feeding pump, everything that kept her alive was plugged into that cord. The power went out at 11:11 when you unplugged it, Missus Delacour said. The backup battery only lasts 12 minutes. Eleven twenty three PM, her ventilator stopped. She suffocated in her sleep while her grandmother was in the bathroom. A little girl is dead because you unplugged an extension cord to do your laundry, Tiago spat. But there was no sign, nothing saying it was medical equipment. I was sobbing now, too. The officer stepped Forward with the handcuffs. You're under arrest for involuntary manslaughter. Full story on channel link below.

My manager locked my Epipen in a glass cabinet while I was having an allergic reaction and told me, if you can talk, you can work. I've been serving the dinner rush at this upscale steakhouse when my throat started closing after someone in the kitchen switched almond oil for olive oil in the staff meal without telling anyone. The moment my lips began tingling and my throat tightened, I ran to my manager, Craig, and explained I was going into anaphylactic shock and needed my Epipen from the first aid cabinet. Immediately, he looked at me from behind the host stand and said, the policy about accessing the medical cabinet during dinner service. Well, I stood there staring at my lifeline sitting just three feet away behind that locked glass. I begged him to open it and explained I had maybe 15 minutes before my throat completely closed. But he looked at the packed dining room and said, if you can talk, you can work. Now table 12 needs refills. Go. My face was swelling like a balloon and customers were starting to stare as I struggled to pour water with shaking hands while my throat got tighter with each breath. I stumbled back to Craig wheezing that I needed the Epipen right now. And he actually laughed saying, what are you gonna do, die on me? During the rush, a woman at table 6. Grabbed my wrist when she saw the hive spreading up my neck and said I needed help immediately. But Craig stepped between us, announcing that any customer who encouraged staff histrionics would be asked to leave. My coworker tried to grab the cabinet keys from his belt, and he fired her on the spot in front of everyone, saying, anyone else want to join her in the unemployment line? I couldn't breathe through my nose anymore and my tongue was so swollen I couldn't speak clearly. But I kept serving bread and taking orders because I was a single mom with no savings and Craig knew it. An older man at the bar stood up and offered to drive me to the hospital him, but Craig threatened to call the police for interfering with staff, and the man sat back down looking horrified. By the time I tried to take Table Fifteen's order, I was making horrible wheezing sounds. The mother at the table was crying, saying, please, somebody help her. But Craig just stood there with his arms crossed watching me struggle. My eyes were so puffy I could barely see. And a teenage bus boy tried to sneak me some Benadryl from his pocket, but Craig saw him and sent him home immediately. I made one more desperate attempt to reach the cabinet, but my vision was going black and Craig actually stepped in front of it saying, you walk off this floor or, and you're done here. Forever. That's when something inside me snapped and I grabbed a water pitcher from the server station and smashed it straight through the glass cabinet. Customers gasped around me and Craig screamed that I was fired. My hands were bleeding from the glass, but I managed to grab my Epipen and jam it into my thigh right there in the middle of the dining room while Craig yelled about destruction of property and how I'd have to pay for the damage. The medication gave me just enough relief to gasp out to the packed restaurant. He tried to kill me rather than let me treat my allergic reaction. Before I collapsed onto the floor, a woman who'd been recording everything on her phone called 9 1 1 while Craig actually tried to grab the phone from her, saying, we handle emergencies internally. But three male customers physically blocked him from getting near me. The paramedics arrived within minutes and immediately started additional treatment because as one explained to the growing crowd of customers, Epipens are just a temporary fix. He still needs immediate medical intervention. As they loaded me onto the stretcher, Craig had the audacity to tell them I was being dramatic. And one of the EMTs turned to him and said loud enough for everyone to hear, she would have been dead in 5 more minutes. The entire restaurant erupted with customers screaming at Craig while he tried to escape to his office. But a group of them Blocked his path until police arrived. The detective who interviewed me at the hospital said 14 customers had provided videos and statements, with one recording capturing Craig saying, what are you gonna do, die on me during the rush. The state board revoked Craig's food service license permanently and the judge at his sentencing called him a sadistic individual who weaponized his authority before giving him two years in prison plus three years probation.

My phone rang. This is Disney staff. Your child is at lost and found. My heart stopped. What happened? Your son says his family told him to wait by the Mad Tea Party while they got fast passes. That was four hours ago. He's been asking every cast member where his mommy went. Four hours. My hands were shaking as I called my ex immediately. Where's Carter? Oh, he's fine. We're back at the Grand Floridian pool. Kids his age get tired of rides anyway. Her voice was slurred. She'd been drinking since lunch. You left him at the park alone. She sighed like I was being overdramatic. Relax, James. Disney's literally the safest place on earth. He'll figure it out. Besides, we paid good money for this adult. It's only vacation adults only. He's your son. Look, Paul wanted to do the grown up rides without a whining kid slowing us down. Carter can handle a few hours by himself. Builds character. We're not helicopter parents like you. I was two states away in Chicago on a business trip. The next flight to Orlando wasn't until 6:00am and every earlier flight was completely booked. Sir, the Disney employee continued, we can keep him overnight in our Family Services center, but we need proper documentation and emergency contacts. He's asking for you specifically. That's when I remembered something that made my blood Boil. Last month, my ex had posted all over Facebook and Instagram about planning her child free Disney adult experience with her new husband. Photos of expensive cocktails at Victoria and Albert's, captions like finally doing Disney the right way. No kids, no stress. She'd even joined Facebook groups about Disney without children and posted countdown photos. She'd literally advertised her plan to abandon our son for a booze filled vacation while still on the phone with Disney security. I started screenshotting everything. Her posts, the time stamps, comments from friends encouraging her adults only Disney trip, her recent check ins at Disney bars during park hours. I sent it all to my lawyer before I even hung up. I'm flying down tonight. I told the cast member, please don't let him out of your sight. I'll cover any costs. Disney employees voice softened. Sir, we take care of our guests. Carter's safe with us. By the time I landed at MCO at 7:00am, my ex was facing criminal child abandonment charges. Turns out leaving a six year old completely alone at a theme park for over four hours isn't just terrible parenting, it's a class 3 felony in Florida. The Orange County Sheriff's Office had already visited her hotel room at 5:00am. The local news picked up the story by noon. Mother abandoned 6 year old at Disney World for adult experience with new husband. The footage of her being LED away in handcuffs from the Grand Floridian lobby. Went viral within hours. Her employer, Orlando General Hospital, saw the coverage during their morning staff meeting. Her nursing license got immediately suspended pending a full investigation.

So I'm like 6 months pregnant and my husband Kyle and I have been keeping our baby name super secret. We've picked Emmitt for a boy and Nora for a girl. But every single family gathering turns into this crazy interrogation session about what we're naming the kid. My mother in law, Janet, is the worst. She'll literally corner me by the kitchen sink and be like, just give me a hint, honey. I promise I won't tell anyone. Meanwhile, she's already told half the neighborhood that I'm having twins because she misheard something at dinner three weeks ago. Then there's my sister Emma, who keeps suggesting names like Braxton and Nivea because apparently normal names aren't creative enough anymore. And don't even get me started on Kyle's brother who keeps pushing for family names. He wants us to name our kid after their dead Uncle Mortimer. Like, dude, it's 2025, not 1825. The breaking point was last Sunday at my in law's house. I'm trying to eat my potato salad in peace when Janet goes, I have a feeling it's going to be Theodore. Doesn't she look like she's carrying a Theodore? And then Emma chimes in with, no way. That baby is definitely a Paisley. Meanwhile, Kyle's cousin starts going on about how we should honor the family tradition and Kyle's dad is nodding along like this is some kind of democracy vote. I looked at Kyle across the table and He had this look like he wanted to crawl under the furniture. That's when I decided enough was enough. So I stood up, put my hands on my belly, all dramatic like and announced, you know what, you guys have been so invested in this, I think you deserve to know. Everyone got quiet real fast. We've narrowed it down to three names, I said, making eye contact with each person. For a boy, we're thinking either Bartholomew, Nebuchadnezzar or Gaylord. And for a girl, it's between Brunilda, Bertha or Methuselah. Kyle nearly choked on his iced tea. Janet's face went completely white. Emma just stared at me with her mouth hanging open like she'd seen a ghost. Brunilda, Janet whispered, like the opera. It's very traditional, I said, completely straight faced, European heritage and all that. The room was dead silent for like 10 seconds. Then Kyle's brother goes, Gaylord. Are you serious right now? It's a perfectly respectable name. Kyle jumped in, catching on. Very distinguished. What happened next was beautiful chaos. Janet immediately started googling how to talk your daughter in law out of terrible baby names. Emma was frantically texting me links to normal name lists. Kyle's dad kept muttering Nebuchadnezzar under his breath like he was trying to practice saying it. For the next three weeks, I got calls every single day. Janet would call with alternative suggestions like Theodore or Michael. Emma sent me a 47 item list of actually cute names that aren't Completely insane. Even Kyle's normally quiet aunt called to tell me about a nice couple she knew who named their daughter brunhilda. And she got teased terribly in school. The best part was watching them try.

My brother Jordan married Nicole last year after a whirlwind romance. She always acted sweet around family, but something about her felt off to me, like she was performing rather than being genuine. I work as a barista at Grind Coffee, a local shop downtown. It's not glamorous, but I love the regular customers, and my manager, Kevin, is pretty cool about everything. Nicole knows where I work, but. And she doesn't. Every Tuesday, Nicole comes in with her book club friends. They order complicated drinks, leave messes, and tip poorly. Nicole acts like she's never seen me before in her life, which is weird, but whatever. I figured she was embarrassed about her brother in law being a coffee shop worker. Last Tuesday changed everything. Nicole walks in around two PM, but not with her book club. She's with this tall guy in an expensive suit, definitely not my brother. They're all over each other, kissing at the counter, his hands all over her waist. She's giggling like a teenager. I'm making their drinks, trying to process what I'm seeing. This woman is married to my brother, wearing her wedding ring, and making out with a stranger in public. Then she turns around and sees me behind the espresso machine. Her face goes completely white. She quickly steps away from the guy, starts acting normal, but it's too late. I saw everything. They order their drinks without making eye contact with me. Nicole whispers something to the guy and they leave quickly. I'm standing there in shock, not sure what to do with this information. The next morning, I get a call from Kevin before my shift. Hey, we need to talk when you get in. Someone filed a complaint about you. My Spino drops at work. Kevin explains that a cuss banner called corporate claiming I was unprofessional, rude, and made inappropriate comments about her personal life. I'm getting an official write up. I know immediately it was Nicole. She's trying to get me fired before I can tell Jordan what I saw. It's actually kind of smart in a twisted way. But here's the thing about our coffee shop. We have security cameras everywhere. Kevin installed them after some theft issues last year. And Kevin's been managing for 10 years. He knows when cuss there are lying. I explain the whole situation to him. How Nicole is my sister in law, how I saw her cheating, and how now she's trying to destroy my job to silence me. Kevin listens without judgment. Wanna see what really happened? He asks, pulling up yesterday's footage on his computer. There it is, clear as day. Nicole walking in with mystery man. Them kissing passionately by the windows. Her wedding ring glinting in the sunlight as she runs her fingers through his hair. Me behind the counter, professional the entire time. Never saying a word to them, Kevin watches the whole thing, then deletes the plaint from corporate system. This never happened, he says, printing out still frames from the video. But you might want these. Family dinner is this Sunday at our parents house. Nicole shows up in a new dress, acting extra sweet to everyone. She keeps glancing at me nervously throughout the meal. During dessert, she leans over with fake concern. How's work going, honey? No problems with difficult cause banners, I hope. You know how some people can be so unreasonable. The whole table is listening. My parents love Nicole. Think she's perfect for Jordan. My brother is completely clueless, cutting his cake with a smile. I smile back at her. Actually works been really interesting lately. We had the situation yesterday with a married woman who came in with her boyfriend. Really awkward when she realized her husband's sister worked there. The table goes quiet. Forks stop moving. Jordan looks confused, glancing between me and Nicole. What do you mean? Jordan asks slowly. Nicole's face is red now. She's just making things up. You know how dramatic she can be. I pull out my phone, show Jordan the security footage still frames Kevin printed for me. This is from Tuesday at two PM. Recognize anyone? Jordan takes the photos, his face changing as he processes what he's seeing. Nicole in another man's arms, kissing him passionately, her wedding ring visible in every shot. Who is this Guy Jordan's voice is barely a whisper. Nicole starts screaming that I'm lying, that the photos are fake, that I'm jealous of their marriage and trying to destroy it. She's

His parents showed up at our door in March without even asking. His mom literally called and told me they were coming to wait out quarantine at our place. Like, not asked, told me. And I already knew this was gonna suck because they've always treated me like garbage. They make these snide comments about everything I do, act like they own the place, and basically think I'm not good enough for their precious son. Right from day one, they started running our apartment like it was theirs. They tell me what to cook, when to clean, how loud my music could be. But the worst part was the stupid air conditioning fight that went on for weeks. It's been like 85 degrees every single day here, and I keep the AC at 70 because that's comfortable, but nope. They started whining about being cold, so I compromised and put it at 75. I'm already sweating my butt off, but whatever. I'm trying to keep the peace. That wasn't good enough, though. They wanted the heat on in 90 degree weather. The heat. I'd wake up in the middle of the night, literally drenched in sweat because they'd sneak over and crank the thermostat up to, like, 80 degrees. I told them to stop messing with it probably 20 times, but they kept doing it anyway. So yesterday morning before work, I grabbed a Roll of duct tape and put, like, 10 pieces over the thermostat. I even wrote a note that said, do not touch the thermostat while I am at work. In big letters. Pretty clear, right? I get home at six PM, and it hits me like a wall of heat the second I open the door. It's hotter inside than it is outside, which shouldn't even be possible. The duct tape is ripped off, my note is crumpled up on the floor, and they've got the heat cranked to 98 freaking degrees. 98! I checked the thermostat three times because I couldn't believe it. I marched straight to the guest room, where they're just chilling like nothing happened. His mom is sitting there filing her nails, and his dad is watching some cooking show. I'm like, dripping sweat already, and I go, why could you not follow the simple instruction of do not touch the thermostat? This is my home! I'm tired of you saying rude things to me. I'm tired of you treating me like a child and making your own rules for my apartment. You either need to respect me and my boundaries or go back to your own house. Mom doesn't even look up from her nails at first. Then she gets this nasty look on her face and says, you have no right to barge in here without knocking. That was not only an invasion of privacy, but you need to take the attitude out of Your tone. I've dealt with much bigger bitches than you before. That's when I completely lost it. She called me a bitch in my own apartment, after I let them stay here for free, after I've been bending over backwards trying to make them comfortable, after they've been treating me like dirt for months. She kept going on and on for, like, 30 minutes about how disrespectful I am and how I need to learn my place and all this other garbage. I just stood there letting her dig her own grave. When she finally shut up, I looked at both of them and said, get out. Pack your stuff and get out of my apartment right now. His dad tried to jump in, like, now hold on. Let's all calm down here, but I cut him off. No, you heard what she said. She called me a bitch in my own home. Get out! They started arguing that they had nowhere else to go and that I was being dramatic. I told them that wasn't my problem and they had one hour to pack their bags before I called the cops. His mom started crying and saying I was ruining their family, but I was done.

I asked my family for help as a test. Three weeks ago, I bought a lottery ticket at the gas station on my way home from work. I always buy one when the Jackpot gets big, just for fun. Never expected anything to come of it. Tuesday morning, I'm drinking coffee and checking the numbers on my phone. I had to look at my ticket five times before it sank in. All six numbers matched $47 million. After taxes, I'd still walk away with about 28 million. I sat there staring at that ticket for an hour, shaking. My first instinct was to call my brother Mike and tell him everything. We've been close our whole lives, or so I thought. But then I remembered something that happened last month. My sister Lisa needed 200 bucks to fix her car. She called Mike first, and he told her he was broke, even though I saw him post pictures of his new golf clubs the same week. She ended up calling me crying, saying she felt like a burden on the family. That's when I got an idea. What if I tested everyone before revealing my win? I wanted to see who really cared about me versus who just saw me as the family ATM. I started small. I called my mom and told her my landlord was raising my rent by $300, and I didn't know how I'd make it. Work. She sighed and said money was tight for everyone these days. Then she started talking about her cruise plans for next month. Next, I texted Mike saying my car needed a new transmission and the repair would cost $800. He left me on read for two days, then finally responded saying he wished he could help, but had his own bills to worry about. I called my sister Lisa and told her I was behind on my electric Bill and might get my power shut off. She immediately said she'd send me $50, which was probably all she had. She even offered to let me stay at her tiny apartment if I needed to. The real test came when I called my dad. I told him I was having trouble making my student loan payments and asked if he could help with just one month. He laughed and said I should have thought about that before dropping out of business school 10 years ago. But then I called my cousin Danny, who I barely talk to anymore. I told him the same story about the student loans. Without hesitation, he said he'd send me $200 and asked if I needed more. He said family looks out for family, no matter what. The results were eye opening. Parents and Mike, who always acted like they cared so much, couldn't be bothered to help when I supposedly needed it most. But Lisa and Danny, who don't have much money themselves, were Ready to give me whatever they could. Yesterday, I called Lisa and Danny and asked them to meet me for dinner. I had something important to tell them. They both showed up worried, probably thinking something was wrong. I pulled out my phone and showed them a screenshot of my bank account. Lisa's jaw dropped and he just started laughing and said he knew something was up because I never asked for help. I explained the whole test and told them they were the only ones who passed. Lisa started crying happy tears, and Danny kept shaking his head in disbelief. Then I told them the best part. I was giving each of them $500,000, no strings attached. Lisa could finally go back to nursing school like she'd always wanted. Danny could start the food truck business he'd been dreaming about. My parents and Mike still don't know about the money. And honestly, after seeing their true colours, I'm not sure they ever will. Sometimes the people who claim to love you the most are the first ones to abandon you when you need help. But the people who show up for you when you have nothing. Those are the ones worth sharing everything with.

When I was 18, I changed my name to Alex. My real name was Angel Martinez. The name of my brother who died when I was 5. He was eight. We were playing by the street. I kicked our ball too hard. He ran after it. The driver didn't see him in time. At the funeral, mom couldn't stop screaming. Dad just stared at me with dead eyes. That night, they packed away all my toys. The next morning, mom called me Angel at breakfast. That's not my name, I said. Dad slapped the table so hard, the plates jumped. It is now. They moved me into Angel's room that day. His clothes became mine. His backpack, toys. When school started, they told everyone there was a mistake on the records. I wasn't me anymore. I was Angel. My friends stopped coming over when mom kept calling me by his name. Teachers looked worried but did nothing. Every night, I'd whisper my real name under the covers. So I wouldn't forget who I was. On Angel's birthday, they made me wear his favorite shirt. And blow out candles on his favorite cake. Make the wish Angel would have made, mom said, her eyes far away and scary. When I was 12, I found the box where they hid all the pictures of me. The real me. Before. In every family photo after the accident, I was dressed Like him standing where he used to stand. It's like I never existed at all. I started failing school on purpose. Angel got straight A's. I got F's. Angel was good at sports. I quit every team. You're ruining his future, dad would yell. He doesn't have a future! I screamed back. Once mom slapped me so hard, my lip bled. I was 16. I ran away for three days. The police brought me back. The officer asked my name, and I said, my real one. Mom started crying. He's confused. He's Angel. Our son, Angel. The day I turned 18, I took all the money I'd saved for my fast food job and filed the papers to be Alex. Not my birth name. A new name. Someone who wasn't me or him. When the papers came, mom locked herself in Angel's room. My room. And tore all his clothes to pieces. Dad showed up at my friend's house where I was staying. Your mother tried to hurt herself last night, he said, his voice hollow. She says, we lost both sons now. You lost angel when he died, I said. You lost me when you tried to bring him back. Last week, mom called for the first time in months. We're selling the house, she said. Do you want his things? Your things? I don't even know anymore. Burn it all, I said. Yesterday I found a box on my doorstep. Inside was a small blue teddy bear. I'd Never seen before. The note just said this was yours before. I'm sorry we made you disappear, too. I held that bear and cried for the first time since Angel died. For him. For me. For the family that died on that street. Even though only one of us was hit. I am Alex now. Not Angel. Not my old self. Someone new who finally gets to exist.

My cousin Rachel just buried her husband and two kids last week. Car accident took them all at once. She's left with just her 5 year old daughter Emma. And honestly, watching them at the funeral was the most heartbreaking thing I've ever seen in my life. So my brother Jake and his wife Kelly show up to our house that morning before we head to the church. First thing Kelly does is announce she's pregnant. We're all getting ready for a funeral. And she's like, guess what, everyone, we have news. My mom congratulated her but told her to keep it quiet for today out of respect. Did Kelly listen? Of course not. The second we get to the church, Kelly starts making these loud gagging noises and rubbing her completely flat stomach. Every time someone looked at her, she'd go, oh, sorry, morning sickness, I'm pregnant. You know, she kept saying stuff like, as a mom, I just can't imagine what Rachel's going through, which was ridiculous because Kelly doesn't have any kids yet. At the cemetery, she literally asked Rachel's sister to give up her seat so the pregnant lady could rest her feet. She'd been standing for like 10 minutes total. I was getting so annoyed, but I kept my mouth shut because it's a funeral. After the service, we went back to my aunt's house. Kelly kept making everything about herself. Someone would Mention how hard this must be for Rachel. And Kelly would jump in with, oh, I know. Now that I'm pregnant, I understand maternal instincts so much better. When people were talking about the babies who died, Kelly would rub her stomach and talk about how excited she was to be a mom. The bathroom thing was what really got me. Every time Kelly needed to use the bathroom, she'd announce pregnant lady coming through or baby on board needs to pee there. We're like 30 people there grieving and she's treating it like her personal pregnancy announcement party. But then she crossed the line. Rachel was sitting quietly in the corner with Emma, both of them just completely destroyed. Kelly walks right up to them, sticks out her flat belly and says, me and Jake just found out I'm pregnant. And honestly, we're beside ourselves thinking about how something like this could happen to us, too. Rachel completely broke down, started sobbing so hard she could barely breathe. Emma got scared and started crying, too. Everyone in the room just stopped and stared. That's when I lost it. I stood up and said loud enough for everyone to hear, Kelly, no one gives a damn that you're pregnant. Look around you. This is a funeral for two babies and their father. You took that pregnancy test 4 days ago and you're acting like you're the first woman to ever get pregnant. Just leave. Kelly started crying and ran out. Jake followed her, but not before calling me a fat, bitter witch in front of everyone. My aunt had to comfort Rachel while my mom took Emma outside. My phone's been blowing up all day with calls from Jake and Kelly's family calling me every name in the book. They're saying I.

I'm preparing the house for Christmas and already exhausted from years of this exact conversation. Last Thanksgiving, my father in law sat at the table while I served everyone saying, this is how it should be. Women have that special touch in the kitchen. Easter before that, my husband's uncle laughed when I carried in all the dishes alone. Better you than me, sweetheart. I don't do domestic work. My own brother visits monthly and has never once touched a dish, just leaves them by the sink like I'm housekeeping. He once actually said, at least you're good at something while I cleared his plate. Even my husband used to do it until I trained that out of him. It only took 3 years of patient conversations. Now his brother is arriving for Christmas week because his girlfriend finally got tired of being his maid and kicked him out. My front door slams open. His bags hit my clean floor. MUD tracks across my freshly mopped tiles. He's standing there actually watching me on a ladder, hanging Garland, both my hands full and says, what's for dinner? I smile at him the way I've smiled that every man in this family who thinks I exist to clean up after them, he doesn't notice. It never reaches my eyes. Christmas Eve and I've been cooking since 5 in the morning for 12 people. My brother in law has been on my couch eating and chips and watching TV for three days straight, hasn't offered to help once. I ask him sweetly to peel potatoes, he actually laughs at me. Not a chuckle, a full belly laugh. That's women's work. I don't do kitchens. I keep my voice light and ask him to at least set the table. He shakes his head like I'm a child who doesn't understand basic concepts. Like I said, women's work. That's why my brother married you, to handle all this. He gestures at my kitchen like it's some foreign country he'll never visit. My husband walks in right as his brother is explaining how his ex did everything wrong, how she got lazy about cooking, stopped keeping the house properly, couldn't even manage a simple pot roast after coming home from work. Women these days don't understand their role, he says. I watch my husband's face change. His jaw tightens. His brother doesn't notice because he's too busy educating me about how kitchens are female territory. I smile, my real smile this time. You're absolutely right. How silly of me to ask. I shouldn't have expected you to lower yourself to women's work. 5 a. M. Christmas morning, I wake him up with a shovel. There's two feet of snow in the driveway. That's men's work, I say in my sweetest voice. He grumbles but goes out because what's he going To say that shoveling isn't gendered. While he's outside, I make and eat breakfast, eggs, bacon, fresh pancakes for me and my husband. Only he comes in frozen and sees an empty table. Where's my breakfast? I tilt my head, confused. Cooking is women's work, you said, I couldn't possibly expect you to lower yourself to eating something from the. He looks at my husband for support. My husband is suddenly very interested in his coffee. Don't look at me. I made the eggs. He's still staring at our empty plates when I pull out a list from my pocket. I've been saving up all the men's work for when we had a man around who doesn't do kitchens. I made you a list of man's work. I suddenly remember all kinds of things that needed done around the house. The gutters need cleaning. The garage needs reorganizing. All men's work, I keep saying sweetly. He tries. Order.

I also canceled the two surprises I planned as a gift. I've been secretly paying for the premium open bar package. And upgraded their honeymoon suite to the penthouse. All in all, I was covering about $8,000 worth of upgrades she didn't even know about. Each vendor I call is shocked when I explain this situation. The cake baker actually says, after everything you've done for her. But I just tell them I need to cancel, and they all understand. Some of them even refuse to work with her if she tries to. The venue calls her three days later to confirm cancellation. That's when my phone starts going off crazy. 47 missed calls in an hour. When I finally answer, she's hyperventilating. What did you do to my wedding? She screams so loud, I have to hold the phone away from my ear. The venue wants $12,000 for a last minute booking. The florist won't even return her calls. The photographer is booked. The caterer says they have no record of her event. I let her rant for a solid minute before I calmly explained that all those vendors were my connections, my accounts, my negotiations. You said you didn't want anything from me, remember? She starts sobbing about how the wedding is in 11 days and everything is ruined, and how could I do this to her? You literally told me not to come. I reminded her these Were all my favors to call in, not yours? She tries to guilt trip me, saying I'm ruining the most important day of her life. Frisa, you said good. When I told you I'd have to cancel everything, you hung up on me. She calls me a jealous bitch and says she'll never forgive me. That's fine, I tell her.

But honestly, if she really felt that threatened by me just existing in a bridesmaid dress, then fine. I told her, okay, if that's what you want. She sounded surprised, like she expected me to beg or cry or something. That night, I started going through all my emails. Every vendor communication is in my inbox because I'm the one who's been handling everything. The venue, that's my boss's country club and he gave us the friends and family discount. The florist, she, the client from my job, the photographer, charging $2,000 instead of his usual $6,000. I designed his entire website portfolio for free last year. The caterer, the DJ, the bartenders, even the hair and makeup team, they're all doing this as favors to me, not her. My sister has no idea that every single contract is technically under my name. The next morning, I called Brisa one more time. Just so you know, if I'm not part of the wedding, I'll need to cancel all the arrangements I made through my connections. She immediately snaps back, good, I don't want anything from you. Anyway, she hung up before I could say anything. I don't think she had any clue what that meant. I spent the rest of that day making calls. First, the venue. I explained that I won't be attending the wedding anymore, so I need to cancel the reservation I made. My boss is confused but says no. Problem next, the florist. She's actually offended when I tell her what happened and says she wouldn't work with my sister now, even if she begged. The photographer is booked solid and happily takes another wedding for that date at his full rate. One by one, I cancel everything, the caterer, the DJ, the cake baker.

So back in March, I proposed to my girlfriend, Jasmine. Everything was going great until we started talking about wedding planning this week. He already picked her bridesmaids and was asking about my groomsmen, trying to figure out who'd walk with who down the aisle. I told her my best man was actually going to be my friend, Kate. The second I said that, Jasmine completely lost it. He started listing off all these ridiculous reasons why Kate couldn't do it. She said it would look weird in photos, that it'd be awkward when Kate walks down the aisle with her maid of honor, that Kate would be too distracting to the guests. And get this, that Kate's too short to stand next to my 6 foot plus groomsman. I mean, what the hell? I told her those reasons were stupid and she got mad at me for not respecting her wishes. She started throwing out suggestions for other guys who could be my best man instead. But here's the thing, Kate's been my closest friend since grad school. He literally introduced me to my entire Social Circle when I was this awkward, nerdy guy who couldn't make friends to save his life. She's been there through everything, good times and bad. Not having her in my wedding felt insane. Jasmine kept pushing, getting more accusatory about why I wanted Kate there. So badly. She was acting like there was something between us, which there isn't. Kate and I have never been romantic or sexual, not even close. We're just really good friends and Jasmine used to be totally fine with that. The argument got heated. Jasmine wouldn't budge and kept acting completely irrational about the whole thing. I could tell the real issue was jealousy, but I wasn't gonna just give into her insecurities. Finally, I told her that if she couldn't let me have this one thing, maybe we shouldn't be getting married at all. She exploded, told me to get out of our apartment immediately. I've been crashing on my buddy Matt's couch for the past three days now. Yesterday I tried calling Jasmine to talk things through, but she just asked if I was ready to apologize. I I told her no because I'm not going to let her think she was right about forbidding me from having Kate in the wedding. The thing is, Kate doesn't even know about any of this drama yet. She was so excited when I first asked her to be my best man a few weeks ago. She actually teared up and said it meant everything to her. We've been through so much together. She helped me study for the MCAT when I was failing. She drove me to the hospital when I broke my arm skateboarding like an idiot. She was there when my mom died two years ago. She's basically Family to me. But Jasmine's acting like Kate's some kind of threat, which is weird because they've known each other for over a year now. And Jasmine seemed cool with our friendship before. They're not best friends or anything, but they've hung out, gone to dinner together, seemed to get along fine. I thought Jasmine had gotten over any jealousy issues about me having a close female friend.

I was standing in line at the grocery store with my nine year old son Jake holding a single bag of flour. That's all we could afford that week, just flour to make some basic bread. When I swiped my E B t card, the machine beeped red, declined. My face burned with embarrassment as I asked the cashier if I could try again. Jake was holding the flower bag against his chest looking confused. Machine beeped again, declined. Behind me, this man in an expensive suit started getting loud. He had a Bluetooth headset in his ear and was tapping his credit card against his hand like he was in some huge rush. Seriously, this is ridiculous, he said loud enough for everyone to hear. Some people really need to get their act together before coming to the store. I tried one more time with the card, my hands shaking. Jake tugged on my sleeve and whispered, mom, what's wrong? The machine beeped a third time. The man behind me got even louder. This is exactly what's wrong with this country. People living off government handouts can't even manage their own money properly. Other customers started staring. I could feel their eyes burning into me. Jake looked around at all the faces, then down at his shoes. Maybe if you got a real job instead of mooching off taxpayers, you could actually pay for your groceries. The man continued, I work 60 hours a week and have to wait behind people who can't even afford a bag of flour. I didn't say anything back. I couldn't. I just took the flower from Jake's hands, put it on the counter and walked out. Jake followed me, asking if we were coming back for it later. Two days later, I got called into HR. At the law firm where I worked as a receptionist. My manager sat me down and said there had been a complaint about my behavior reflecting poorly on the company. When I asked what she meant, she said a senior client had recognized me, causing a scene at a grocery store. But I didn't cause any scene. I told her I just left when my card didn't work. He pulled out her phone and showed me a video. Someone had filmed the whole thing. You could see me standing there quietly while the man behind me yelled about government handouts and taxpayers. You could see Jake looking embarrassed and confused. Our client sent this to us. She said he felt it was important we know about this incident. I, I stared at the video in shock. I was just trying to buy flower for my son. It's about optics, Maria. This firm has a reputation to maintain. We can't have employees who, well, who create these kinds of situations in public, create situations. I didn't say a single word to that man, but it didn't matter. They let me. Go that afternoon just like that. No warning, no second chance. They said it was about maintaining the firm's image. A week later, Jake was playing with my phone when he started laughing. Mom, there's a video of you on here. Someone had posted the grocery store incident on TikTok. But this time, the comments were completely different.

So I'm getting married next month to my girlfriend, Emma. And honestly, it's been the most stressful thing I've ever planned. We've been saving for two years, booked this amazing venue, and Emma's been dreaming about this day since we got engaged. She has this Pinterest board with like 500 pins of centerpieces and table settings. About three weeks ago, I was over at my brother Tyler's place helping him fix his sink. He's five years older than me and has always been the golden child in our family. While I was under the sink with a wrench, he casually asks if it would be cool if he proposed to his girlfriend, Becca, at our wedding reception. I literally banged my head on the pipe. I came out laughing because I thought he was joking. I said something like, yeah, sure, if you want Emma to murder you with her cake knife. We both laughed it off and I figured that was the end of it. Then last Tuesday, Emma comes home from work crying, like full on sobbing in our kitchen. She tells me Tyler called her and thanked her for letting him propose at the wedding. Emma was confused and told him that never happened and he absolutely couldn't do that. Tyler just laughed and said thanks again before hanging up. I was furious. I called Tyler immediately. And he picks up all casual like nothing happened. I asked what the hell he was thinking. That's when he drops this bomb about how he's getting even with me because I announced our engagement at a family dinner where he was introducing Becca to everyone for the first time. The thing is, I had no clue he was bringing her that night. They showed up separately and she arrived like 20 minutes after I made the announcement. I didn't even know they were serious at that point. Tyler kept insisting he was going to propose no matter what I said. He had this whole speech prepared about family unity and how romantic it would be. I told him flat out that if he didn't drop this idea completely, both him and Becca were banned from the wedding. If he even tried to pull something like this, security would escort them out. That's when Tyler completely lost it. He started screaming about how I was being selfish and controlling. He hung up on me and immediately called our parents, our aunts and uncles, basically everyone in our family.

My friend autumn asked me to hang out with her during her overnight shift at the pawn shop there had been three robberies at other shops in the area this month and an employee was killed at the last one. I got there at 9 as the last customer was leaving and autumn was locking the front door, explaining we'd only buzz in people who had items on them. The buzzer went off for the first time at 10:30 when autumn buzzed the man in. He walked up to the counter with this big smile, and he needed quick cash for a family emergency and had electronics to sell. But something felt off about how he kept looking around the shop instead of at us while he talked, memorizing where all the cameras were. While autumn examined his old laptop, the man walked around the shop, stopping at the case with the guns, asking if those were real. Autumn said yes, but they kept them locked, and he nodded, then asked about the jewelry case electronic section, like he was cataloging everything valuable. He came back to the counter and after a minute asked how much cash the shop kept on hand for buying items, when autumn looked up nervously and said it varied. He asked if we knew about Luna, the employee who died last week. The way he knew her name made my skin crawl because it hadn't been Released in the news, Autumn's hands started shaking, and she said, no, we didn't know her. He said that was good, because it would be traumatic to lose a friend that way, bleeding out behind the counter while the safe was being emptied. Neither of us had heard that detail, and autumn asked how he knew that. He smiled and said he paid attention to things. He asked if we were alone in the shop, and when autumn said the owner checked the cameras remotely, he looked directly at each camera and counted them out loud, then said, cameras didn't help Luna. My heart was pounding now as he walked to the back area where the guitars hung, running his hands along them, then to the tool section. Picking up a crowbar and feeling its weight, he brought it back to the counter and set it down, saying it was a nice one, good quality. Could probably open anything with it. He asked autumn if she'd ever been robbed before, and when she said no, he said, Luna probably said the same thing before that night. He leaned across the counter and asked if autumn knew what Luna's mistake was. We. We're both frozen, as he said she'd been too slow opening the safe, had fumbled the combination twice because her hands were shaking, and that made everything take longer than necessary. He said delays were dangerous for everyone involved. Adam's hand moved toward the silent alarm, but he grabbed Her wrist, not hard, but firm. And said Luna had tried that too, but the police took 12 minutes to arrive. He let go and stepped back, say, and he needed to make a withdrawal from the safe. All the cash and the good jewelry from the case. Autumn said she couldn't do that, and he said she could and would, because he'd asked nicely once already. He mentioned that Luna had said she couldn't open the safe either, but eventually she did. It just took some convincing. And unfortunately, the convincing went

Traditional men are called Mister by their women. His mother yelled at him through the entire dinner while I sat silently asking Craig for permission to eat each bite on the Drive home, he exploded. Fine. I was wrong. Please just go back to normal. I smoothed my dress carefully. Oh, Mr Anderson. A traditional woman never questions her man's first decision. It would not be proper for me to disagree with you. The vein in his forehead looked ready to pop as I smiled sweetly and walked exactly three steps behind him to his apartment door.

So I became the one she couldn't compete with. Growing up, Kenzie never let me forget my place in our friendship. Every party, every hangout, every introduction came with the same unspoken rule. I was the designated ugly fat friend who made her shine brighter. This is my friend who's really funny, she'd say, which everyone knew meant not pretty. It hurt every single time. Kenzie was gorgeous. I knew do that. But her constant reminders made me believe I was worthless. Was I really that hideous? When I was 22, something shifted. I needed a physical outlet for my anxiety and found a groupon for a rock climbing gym across town. The first day my hands shook on every hold, but something about solving each route, finding my path up the wall made me feel powerful. That's when I discovered my escape. I started climbing four nights a week in secret. My hands bled, then calcified. I'd ice my forearms after every session, watch technique videos until 2:00am, practice grip strength exercises at my desk. Wednesday and Friday nights, I climbed with the regulars, including this guy, Sebastian, who became my climbing partner. We'd spot each other, celebrate sends, build genuine friendship through shared challenges. I never mentioned him to Kenzie. She wouldn't care about my gym friends anyway. Meanwhile, Kenzie had become obsessed with her marketing firm crush. She constantly prove I was the ugly friend by making me Stand next to her in mirrors, see the difference, she'd say, adjusting her hair. Some people just have it. Others are good listeners. She'd drag me shopping, hold up identical outfits against us both. This would look cute on me. You should stick to black. It's slimming. What killed me was how she document everything on Instagram, always cropping me out or positioning me behind her natural beauty. She caption photos where I was literally holding her phone's ring light. I started wondering if she was right. Maybe I was fooling myself thinking climbing made me worth something. Kenzie's birthday party was approaching. This rooftop bar event she'd been planning for months. She'd invited her entire office, especially her crush. He finally rsvp'd yes, he squealed. I need you there, but like don't talk too much. Just laugh at my jokes and leave early if I give you the signal. The night of the party, she made me wear this shapeless black dress. It's so you, she lied. As guests arrived, she positioned me strategically, visible enough to make her look charitable for having an ugly friend, hidden enough not to distract. Then her crush walked in with three friends. Kenzie grabbed my arm, whispered, remember your wallpaper? But when he scanned the crowd, his eyes stopped on me. His whole face lit up. Oh my god, red, he called out using my climbing nickname. Kenzie froze. Sebastian practically ran over his friends trailing behind. Guys, this is the girl. I've been telling you about the one who sent that impossible 5 11 route last week. He turned to me, eyes bright with genuine excitement. I can't believe you're here. Wait, you know, Kenzie. For the next hour, Sebastian couldn't stop talking about our climbing adventures. He told everyone about the time I helped him overcome his fear of overhangs, how I taught him this specific, the heel hook technique, how watching me climb had made him a better athlete. His friends already knew stories about me. Sebastian had apparently been talking about his badass climbing partner for months. Kenzie stood there, designer dress and perfect make, useless against authentic connection. How long have you been doing this together, someone asked. Six months, Sebastian said, then looked at me with this soft expression. Best six months of my week, every week. Kenzie tried to interject, mentioning the marketing campaign they'd worked on together. Sebastian barely heard her. He was already pulling up videos on his phone showing everyone this route we'd worked on together. His hand naturally finding my shoulder as he narrated our victory. You never told me you climbed, Kenzie said, her voice sharp. You never asked what I did Wednesday and Friday nights, I replied. You just said to stay out of your way. Sebastian looked between us, understanding dawning on his face. Wait.

I slammed on the brakes and jumped out of my car. Nora, baby, what are you doing out here? She was shivering violently in just her school clothes, no coat, tears frozen on her little cheeks. Daddy locked me out, he said. I can't come back until you get home from work. My heart dropped. It was nine PM on a Friday. Jonathan knew I always worked late on Fridays. This wasn't an accident. How long have you been out here since you left this morning, she whispered. I scooped her up, feeling how ice cold her little body was and carried her toward our front door. It was locked. I used my key, Fury building with every, every step. I found Jonathan exactly where I expected, sprawled on the couch in his boxers and T-shirt, controller in hand, playing call of duty. The heat was cranked up to 75 degrees. Empty beer cans littered the coffee table. Why was our daughter outside for 12 hours? I tried to keep my voice calm. He didn't even pause his game. She spilled grape juice on my new controller this morning. I told her actions have consequences. I stared at him in disbelief. She's 6 years old, Jonathan. She spilled juice accidentally and you left her outside to freeze? Maybe next time she'll be more careful around my stuff. That's when I noticed Nora's pink backpack sitting by the front door. It was stuffed full, bulging at the seams. Her favorite stuffed bunny was sticking out the top. What's this? I pointed at the bag. Jonathan finally paused his game and turned to look at me. There was something cold in his eyes I'd never, ever seen before. I've been doing a lot of thinking today. While she was outside, he said slowly, this whole family thing isn't working out for me, nor is too much work, too expensive, too loud. And honestly, I never wanted kids in the first place. The room started spinning. What are you talking about? I'm talking about you taking her and leaving tonight. I already had the locks changed while you were at work. You just got lucky I hadn't switched them out yet. I felt like I was in a nightmare. You're abandoning your own daughter. Nora was still clinging to me, her wet clothes soaking through my work blazer. She was listening to every word, her big brown eyes darting between us. Here's the thing. Jonathan stood up, stretching like this was all perfectly normal. She's not really mine anyway. I mean, yeah, biologically, whatever, but I never signed up for this dad life. You can have her. The casual cruelty in his voice made me sick. This was the man I've been married to for eight years, the man who used to read Nora bedtime stories. Jonathan, she's your daughter. You can't just watch Me? He picked up his phone. I already talked to my buddy Steven, who's a lawyer. Apparently, if I just voluntarily give up my parental rights, I don't have to pay child support either. Win, win. My hands started shaking, but not from fear, from rage. I pulled out my phone and speed dialed a number I'd hoped I'd never have to use. Hi, Christine. It's Caroline. Remember that emergency custody documentation we.

Do what you want with that information. 5. Pleasuring someone via your mouth is technically illegal in South Carolina, although I don't know how it's actually enforced. Six throughout Alabama, it's illegal for a person to walk down the street with an ice cream cone in their back pocket. Back when most people got around on horseback, horse thieves would put ice cream in their pocket to lure horses away without being charged with stealing. 7. It is illegal to parachute inside Saint Peter's Basilica in the Vatican. After a person did it, they had to create that law specifically for him. He walked away, no charge as the law did not exist. Eight in Connecticut, a pickle can't be considered a pickle, nor sold as one, unless it bounces when dropped from the height of one foot in the air. This state regulation was the result of devious pickle packers selling substandard pickles that obviously didn't bounce. Nine if in Western Australia, possessing more than 50 kilograms of potatoes.

One, I was travelling and on one leg of the trip, what I thought was a two hour layover was actually a 26 hour wait. I didn't have the right visa to leave the airport and the customs guy said I wouldn't be able to stay overnight. So I asked him if I could buy a visa anywhere at the airport. He gave me a price, but it was in the local currency and I didn't know the exchange rate. The ATM would only dispense USD for an American card. So I took out $100 and went back to the desk. I handed the customs official the money and asked, is this enough? It wasn't until I saw him put it in his pocket before stamping my passport that I realised I had just paid a bride. 2. I scanned a dollar Bill and printed it out. In computer class in seventh grade, the substitute teacher called the cops. An officer showed up, took me in a small room, threw the actual book at me and made me read the entries on counterfeiting aloud. I was super scared, but girls like me a lot more after I got pulled out of class by the police. 3, riding a bike drunk. Apparently that's a DUI. 4, when I was in middle school, my dad would give me $20 a week to pay for much. I was rarely ever hungry at Lunch. So I just ended up saving the money. One day, someone asked to borrow a dollar to buy snacks, and they pay me back with a quarter as interest the following week. I agree and it becomes a thing. Next thing I know, more people are quietly borrowing money from me and paying me back. And it kind of snowballs to the point where I even had teachers borrow money from me once in a while. During this period, I had lamented to my buddies that one or two folks who had borrowed from me often were avoiding me because they couldn't pay me back. Someone offered to collect the money for me if they could keep some of what they got. It sounded like a good deal, so I agreed. I eventually stopped doing it because I felt like people were only using me for my money. I tried to reinvent it myself when I started high school years later, I realized that I had inadvertently been a lone shark. 5 pumped my own gas. New Jersey is an odd place.

I taught my daughter about being kind to everyone. I never thought it would save multiple lives. My 15 year old Emma came home last Tuesday acting weird. She kept checking her phone every few minutes and seemed nervous about something. When I asked what was wrong, she just said nothing, mom, and went straight to her room. She barely touched her dinner that night, just pushed the spaghetti around her plate. The next morning she hugged me extra long before school. She never does that anymore. She's usually rushing out the door complaining about being late for first period. I thought maybe she had a big test or presentation. Something felt off, but I couldn't put my finger on it. She even forgot her favorite water bottle on the counter. Around 10:00am, I got a call from the school. My heart stopped when I saw the number pop up on my phone. The Principal's voice was shaky as she said there was an emergency and all parents needed to come to the school immediately. She wouldn't tell me what happened over the phone, which made my panic even worse. I raced to the school and saw police cars everywhere. Ambulances lined the street with their lights flashing. Parents were crying and hugging each other in the parking lot, some still in their pajamas from rushing over. My hands were shaking as I searched frantically for Emma, I found her sitting with a police officer in the main office. The officer asked me to sit down. I knew this couldn't be good news. For the past three weeks, Emma had been sitting with this quiet kid named Marcus at lunch. He always looked sad and.

You guys went to drinks, had fun, even kissed at the end of the night, and now you're not calling him back? He said we kissed? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He said that you guys kissed and everything seemed to be going great, he was surprised that you didn't want to go on another date with him. Oh, my god.

I stood there as maid of honor, holding her bouquet, watching her eyes fill with tears just thinking her fiance had another woman. An elderly woman in the back stood up and pointed directly at me. That's her! That's Susie! The whole church turned to stare at me, including my best friend Janice. But I was just as confused as everyone was in the room.

Are you guys keeping up with this story? Alisa is a 15 year old at Utah girl who vanished on April 21st after her mom dropped her off at school or so she thought. Alisa then left the school headed to a gas station and then went to a track station and took a train to Provo. But that's where the cops lost her. So police go to her social media and they start snooping around and see that she's been speaking with a 38 year old man named William Taylor Grinds. And the conversation between the two is very, very sexually charged. So Glynns tells police that yes, he had been speaking to her but no, he's never actually met up with her. And the last time he heard from her was when she sent him a text message from some stranger's phone at a random bus stop in Utah. But then last week police arrest another man 35 year old Matthew Nichols Manard who was also talking to Lisa in a very sexual way. Alisa's iPad shows the conversation between her and Menard are talking about her running away. And Menard says that he'd fly to Vegas to meet up with her but work wouldn't allow him to until late may or early June. Here's where it gets even crazier. Now police have arrested a third man 41 year old Samuel Mitchell And again, conversations are very sexual in nature. Alisa told him that she wanted to run away to Vegas, and he told her that he would help kidnap her if that's what she wanted. Here's what's so scary to me. All three of these men have been charged, but none of them have been charged with anything related to Alisa's disappearance. They're facing charges related to the conversation. So, uh, enticing a minor and sexual exploitation. So if they didn't kidnap her, where is she? Police have also said that these men didn't know each other. It wasn't part of like, a ring. These were all separate conversations with Alyssa.

So my kids daycare had some family emergency and shut down for the day. They sent this email at like 3 in the morning, which was real helpful when I'm already asleep and have to work the next day. I'm scrambling around trying to find someone to watch my kid because I literally could not miss work that day. Had this huge presentation that would basically make or break my job. So I'm calling everyone I know at like 6:00am. The only person who picks up is my step brother's girlfriend, Ashley. Doesn't work, just sits around all day while my step brother pays for everything. I mean everything. Her daily Starbucks runs, weekly nail appointments, the whole designer purse collection. been trying to get her to do literally anything productive for years, but whatever, I'm desperate. I call her up and she's like, oh, sure, I can totally watch him for you. I'm thinking, finally, someone's actually gonna help me out. Then she hits me with it. My family rate is $200 for six hours. I literally had to ask her to repeat that because I thought I heard wrong. $200, six hours to watch one kid who mostly just plays with his tablet anyway? Are you being serious right now? I asked. She goes on this whole speech about how this is her livelihood and she takes childcare very seriously and that she's already giving me a family Discount. I'm thinking, what livelihood? You haven't worked a day since you moved in with my stepbrother three years ago. But I'm stuck. If I don't show up to work that day, I'm literally getting fired. So I agree to her insane price, and she demands the money up front. Before I even drop my kid off. I hand over $200 cash, drive to work fuming, and end up working barely four hours after you factor in traffic. So I basically paid 50 bucks an hour for her to sit on her couch and make sure my kid didn't burn the house down. Fast forward two years. Ashley and my step brother break up, but somehow she ends up living rent free in his dad's extra house and driving my dad's old car. My step brother still pays all her bills because they have a kid together. Now. She finally gets a job at some retail place because he stopped funding her weekly spa days. Then last month, I get this panicked text in our family group chat. Emergency. My babysitter bailed and I have to work today or I'll get fired. Can anyone watch my daughter, please? I'm desperate. I'm reading this text, and I can't help but smile a little. I text her back super fast, I can totally help you out. I'll watch her. She's so relieved and grateful, sending me heart emojis and everything. Then I hit her with the kicker. My family rate is $200. For the day. The typing bubbles appear and disappear, like, five times. Then my phone starts blowing up. Are you kidding me right now? That's way too much. I thought we were family. You're being ridiculous. Just screenshot our old conversation from two years ago and send it back to her. This is the exact same rate you charged me. You said it was the family rate, remember? You said you took this very seriously. She completely lost it. Started calling me every name in the book, saying I was petty and vindictive and that she was in a real emergency. I told her that's exactly what I said to her two years ago. The best part? She ended up having to call out of work anyway because nobody else would watch her kid for free on such short notice. And apparently, her manager was not happy about it.

I Learned how to make a full meal out of whatever was in the back of our kitchen cabinets. My mom called it creative cooking, but really it was just survival. Like when we'd run out of real food by the third week of every month, I got really good at making spaghetti using ramen noodles and ketchup packets from McDonald's. My little brother Jake thought it was a special recipe until he went to his friend's house and saw what actual spaghetti looked like. The worst part was pretending everything was normal at school. When kids talked about going out to eat, I'd nod along like I knew what they meant. Honestly, the only restaurant I've been to was the Soup Kitchen downtown, and that didn't really count. I remember this one time in 4th grade when our teacher asked us to write about our favorite family tradition. Everyone wrote about Christmas morning or birthday parties. I wrote about Cabinet Day, the day every month when mom would dump out all our kitchen cabinets and we'd get creative with whatever expired cans and random ingredients we found. My teacher, Mrs. Rodriguez, kept me after class. She asked if everything was okay at home. I told her Cabinet Day was fun, like a cooking game show. She didn't look convinced, but she let me go. The thing is, you get really good at making stuff work. Like when my Shoes got holes in them. I Learned to put duct tape inside so my socks wouldn't get wet. When our heat got shut off, I figured out that if you left the oven door open, it could warm up the kitchen pretty good. I also got really good at math because I was always counting money. Not like homework math, but real math. Like if milk costs three dollars and we only have two, 50, how many days can we make cereal with water instead? Or if electricity costs sixty dollars and we only have 40, which appliances can we unplug to make it last longer? But the weirdest thing I Learned was how to be invisible at school. Poor kids develop the superpower where we can blend into the background. Like when they were collecting money for field trips, I'd suddenly need to use the bathroom. When they passed out the free lunch forms, pretend to be really interested in my textbook. The free lunch thing was the worst. They'd call out names over the intercom every morning for kids who qualified for free meals. They might as well have announced, here are all the poor kids in school. I started bringing empty lunch bags and pretending to eat air sandwiches just to avoid that walk of shame to the lunch counter. Then something crazy happened. In 6th grade, this new kid, Austin, moved to our school. His family was even worse off than mine. On his second day, When they called the free lunch names, I stood up and said, finally, I'm starving, really loud. Everyone laughed, but not in a mean way. That's when I realized something. I was spending so much energy hiding being poor that I was missing out on actually living. Austin became my best friend because he didn't care who knew his family struggled. He traded his free lunch pizza for my free lunch hamburger without any shame. We started this thing where we have poverty competitions, see who could come up with the most creative poor kids solutions. Like Austin figured out that if you filled up water bottles at school, you could take free drinks home. I discovered that if you ask nicely, the cafeteria ladies would sometimes give you extra rolls to take with you. The best part was when Austin's mom got a new job and they moved to a better apartment. Instead of forgetting about being poor, he invited me over to show me their new place. They had a full refrigerator for the first time in years. His mom made us sandwiches with actual lunch meat instead of government cheese. And Austin looked at me and said, we made it.

This is the pastor's home. If your pastor lives in a house like this, they were not blessed by god. They are scamming you. This lunatic pastor was just arrested for holding 70, some people hostage, forced labor, and laundering millions of dollars. Last week, the FBI arrested the pastor and executive director of the Kingdom of God Global Church out of North Tampa, Florida. The federal indictment says Pastor David Taylor and Executive Director Michelle Brannon recruited these people to work at call centers and referred to them as armor bearers. They were forced to these locations, were not paid, were not allowed to leave, could not speak with their families, and were forced to take contraceptives. And if these people didn't meet their financial quotas, food was withheld. They were physically beaten and forced to stay awake for long periods of time. Very Christian like. And he was able to recruit these people by claiming to be an apostle and quote, Jesus's best friend. He would then tell his followers if they didn't obey and donate massive amounts of money, they would suffer in hell. The indictment says these two scammed people out of more than $50 million and use nearly every penny of the money to fund their own lavish lifestyles. This reminds me of that pastor who told his ushers to close the door, the church doors and wouldn't let the congregation leave until they raised $40,000. Do you remember that?

I was 32 when my kidneys basically gave up on me. Just like that. One day I'm fine, next day I'm peeing blood and my face looks like a balloon. Doctor told me I had maybe six months before I'd need a machine to keep me alive, or I wouldn't see Christmas. The dialysis treatments were hell. Three times a week, four hours each time, hooked up to this machine that cleaned my blood because my body couldn't do it anymore. I'd sit there watching Netflix on my phone, listening to other patients talk about their families coming to visit. Meanwhile, I'm sitting alone because my only family disappeared when I was 8. My mom, Karen, literally vanished one Tuesday morning. Left me sleeping and never came back. Foster care, group homes, the whole deal. I used to wonder if she was dead or alive. But after 24 years of nothing, I figured she was probably gone. So when Doctor Martinez told me I needed a kidney transplant and asked about family donors, I just shrugged. It's just me, I said. He put me on the national donor list, but warned me the wait could be years. People my age with my blood type, we weren't exactly priority. Crazy thing is, while I'm sitting in that dialysis chair every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday slowly dying, Karen was doing the exact same thing. Three states over. Liver failure from years of drinking. And god knows what else. She'd been in and out of jail, living under fake names. Basically destroyed her body completely.

Okay, so this happened during 7th grade history when we had this substitute teacher, Mister Ramos. He. He was only supposed to be there for like a week while our regular teacher was sick. Nothing crazy, just some boring guy clicking through slides about the Civil War or whatever. But on Wednesday, something really weird happened that still makes me cringe thinking about it. So class had just ended. Everyone was saying bye and closing their laptops. I was still on the call, though, because me and my friends Aria and Josh always stayed on after to mess around and share TikToks. We'd screen share funny videos and just talk about random stuff. That's when Mister Ramos's camera suddenly came back on. At first we thought maybe he forgot to leave the call, but then we realized he had no idea we were still there. He couldn't see us because our cameras were off. He got up from his desk, took his button down shirt completely off, and lit up a cigarette right there in what looked like his bedroom. Then he opened another laptop next to him and pulled up what looked like a live stream of himself teaching our class from earlier that day. We all just froze like what the hell was happening? He started clicking through this folder on his computer called Zoom Class Recordings and began laughing to himself while watching clips of Us from previous classes. That's when he started talking to himself and saying really messed up stuff about all of us kids. Look at this little girl. Always pretending to care about history. She's probably cheating on every assignment, he said while pointing at the screen. Then he clicked on another video and started making fun of this kid Tyler, who always ask questions. Little Tyler thinks he's so smart, but his parents still cut his food for him. He kept going for like 10 minutes just roasting

Everyone knew Alexis Parker was untouchable. Investment banker at 28. Drove a Tesla, lived in a penthouse. I fixed her AC unit when her buildings regular guy was sick. She watched me work, typing on her laptop, worth more than my monthly rent. When I finished, she said, you're different from the usual repair guys. Because I didn't hit on you? Because you noticed my MIT diploma and didn't suddenly get weird about it. Talked for an hour. She was brilliant, but lonely. Rich people, she said, only saw her money. Poor people only saw her money. Everyone saw her money. What do you see? She asked. Someone whose AC was broken. She laughed. A real laugh, not the polite one rich people do. Started texting me about random broken things. Dishwasher, cabinet door, flickering light. Half weren't even broken. I knew she knew I knew. We both pretended otherwise. One night she called, crying. My engagement party is tomorrow. What? Parents arranged it? He's perfect on paper. Harvard Law, family money. Knows which fork to use. But? But he's never fixed anything with his hands. Never had to. Wouldn't know how. I showed up at her engagement party in my only suit. Told everyone I was fixing the wine cooler. Her fiance, Christopher Hale, kept calling me the help. Alexis found me in the kitchen. Came. Your wine cooler is not actually broken. I know. She kissed me, right? There, catering staff everywhere. This is insane. I said. My whole life is insane. You? We're the only real thing in it. We dated in secret for three months. She'd come to my studio apartment, amazed I could cook actual food, not just order it. I'd go to her penthouse, amazed anyone needed three bathrooms for one person. Her parents found out when her mother saw us at Home Depot. Alexis was helping me pick tile for a job.

My teacher called me to his office and said, you're tutoring Fiona Cove. She needs to pass or she's benched for the season. My first thought, I don't have time for this. Before I could respond, he showed me her test scores on his computer. All C's and D's with the occasional F. She needs someone patient who won't give up on her. You're going to get extra credit, plus a recommendation letter for grad school if you do this. The bribery was working. Fiona was campus royalty. Always surrounded by teammates, always rushing between practice and game. She's desperate to stay on the team. One semester. That's all I'm asking. The offer was too tempting, so I agreed to meet her. Finding her waiting outside the library was surprising. I walked over with my chemistry books. Hey, Fiona. Ready to tackle some chemistry? She looked up, relieved, her practice bag dropping. You actually showed when I nodded. Confused, she explained three tutors had stood her up. They probably figured I was hopeless. The first session, Fiona kept writing down everything I said frantically. Slow down. I need to get this exactly right. I watched her rewrite the same equation four times. It doesn't need to be perfect. She shook her head stubbornly. Yes, it does. I can't lose basketball. We spent three hours on basic periodic table memorization. Fiona made flashcards for every single element. Hydrogen, atomic, Number one, she recited while pacing. Her determination was unexpected. Most people think I'm just here for basketball. She. But I actually want to learn this. The third week we met after her practice at ten PM. Fiona showed up, exhausted but focused. Sorry coach kept us late. Did you eat? She pulled out two sandwiches from her bag. I grabbed extra from the dining hall. We worked through molecular structures while eating. Fiona kept asking questions that showed she was really thinking. Why does oxygen form two bonds but nitrogen forms three? I explained electron shells and watched understanding dawn on her face. That actually makes sense. She high fived me impulsively, then pulled back, embarrassed. Sorry. I get excited. I tried to focus.

Well, I don't, cause I would be weird. But I do think it was so crazy that it really helped my character development. So when I was in middle school, I had a best friend, okay, when I was in sixth grade, we were like. We were like this. And I went to an international school, okay? So, like, basically, new people were coming in and out, like, all the time. Like, sometimes people would only stay for a year, and then sometimes if you're, like, local to the area, you would, like, stay there your whole life. So me and my best friend were like this. But then one year, like, the beginning, I think this was, like, at the beginning of sixth grade, or maybe even in the middle of the year, a new girl came, and she kind of started to join our little group and, like, okay, a trio. Like, I can do this. Then slowly I started to notice that they would, like, gang up on me, like, do two against one. Like, like, little things like hanging out at each other's houses and then, like, telling me how much fun they had, but, like, that I wasn't invited. And then, like, when you'd pick a partner for a project, like, they would pick each other and be like, but not me. We'll call the first friend T and the second friend C. So T&C started being like this and, like, leaving me out from stuff. And then it slowly became, like, they would just completely ignore me. Like, I wasn't part of the group at all. Like, it was just them, too. But then when it was separately, like, when I had a class with T, she would be really, really nice to me. And when I had a class with just C, she would be really, really nice to me. Very mind game stuff. And it got to the point where I was like, okay. Like, I don't do well with being bullied. Like, that's what I felt like. I was like, I'm being bullied. I've never been the type to, like, take it. Like, I need to, I, I need to stand up. Like, I need to say something, even if it means, like, I'm not gonna have any friends for the year. But right when I was deciding, like, oh, I think I'm gonna, like, just call them on their shit, like, I don't care if they completely ditch me and I have no friends for the year, like, I need to, girl, I need to stand up.

I have to show you everything she did, starting with cupboard No. 1 in the kitchen. You might be like, okay, she put your spices on the rack? No, girl, I bought this for my skincare. This was hidden away in my closet. And maybe I can find a screenshot of, like, what my cupboards used to look like, cause this was not it. And what makes it crazier, I don't know if this was an accident or what, but I'm pretty sure she did it alphabetically. Basil, chili, cinnamon, garlic powder, pepper, red peppers. Yeah, it's in perfect alphabetical order. So I found this, like, stack of hair bands on my vanity table, and I was like, where did you find these? Like, I get that you find hair bands when you're cleaning. This was, like, a lot of hair bands. Very shortly realized not only has our homegirl put in a damn basket in our cupboards, stacked and organized all my ramen, she has also put the proper clips on all of my pasta and rice bags instead of the hair bands I usually use. Also, grow up. He also made me a medicine box. Like, I just know she watched that back to college medicine box that that mom, like, built her daughter. Like, she pulled these from Every different spot of my apartment. Like, none of this stuff was, like, in the cupboard at all. Some was in my bathroom, some was in my bedroom, and now it's all in here. It gets better. She decided to give me baskets for my dishwasher pods and my trash bags hanging on the inside of my cupboard. You showed up with adhesive clips in a dream? Cause it just gets better. Dishwasher brush hung. And this was just a bottle of, like, Dawn dish soap. Put it in a soap dispenser. Let's take a trip to my bathroom really quick. Toothbrush now hanging on the wall. And what I love most about it, it covers a stain. You can kind of see part of it, but there's a stain on this wall from hair dye. The clip covers it. She also hung the towel that used to be wedged in between here and hid the other part of the stain. That's from hair dye. The next thing first, I was like, did she, like, leave me a note? Like, what is this? No note. She just started me a grocery list, ripped out a page from god knows what incredible stuff. The last thing. Like, this is why I. Look, I know she's a mother. She called me out so hard for this. Tell me, why the stack of unopened mail sitting on my counter? Judge? Because. Yeah, girl, like, right? Clock it. Why do I have. Why do I have so much unopened mail. And finally I was like, damn, did she do all that and steal my vacuum? Like. Cause I could not find my vacuum for the life of me. Honestly, at that point I was like, just take it as a tip, like, you deserve it. And then I find it. Hung my vacuum on my storage cupboard. Mind your business. If you see me making a 52 part series on how I fell in love with my cleaning lady. Uh huh. I'm coming for you, Kendra.
