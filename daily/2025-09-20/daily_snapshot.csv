My 16 year old Sophie had been begging for AirPods Pro all summer, the new 300 dollar model. She'd researched every feature, watched countless unboxing videos, even created a detailed comparison chart showing why the Pro version was essential for her aesthetic. Her birthday arrived and I surprised her with the exact model. I was so proud finding them in stock when they've been sold out everywhere. Her face dropped the second she opened the box. Um, these are the regular AirPods Pro. She held them like they were defective. I specifically said I need the AirPods Pro Max. Everyone at school has the Max version now. These make me look poor. The Max version. This kid wanted the $600 over ear headphones that cost more than my car payment. Her music career consisted of making 15 second TikTok dance videos to trending songs. The Pro version has the same sound quality I explained trying to salvage the moment. These are what actual musicians use for professional work. Mom, nobody cares about sound quality. It's about the look. These tiny earbuds are so basic. The max ones are a statement piece. Was already putting them back in the box. Can you just return these and get the right ones? It's only like 300 bucks more. Only 300 bucks more. Like I was made of money that stung deep. I'd specifically researched which model music professionals recommended. I'd read reviews, compared features. Even asked my friend who works in audio production. I'll think about it, I said quietly, taking the box from her. She was already back on her phone. Thanks, mom. You're the best. Make sure you get the space gray ones, not silver. Silver looks cheap on camera. I just nodded and walked away. Next day, I'm at Apple Store standing in the return line, still feeling terrible about the whole situation. The line was moving slowly and I could hear the customer service conversation happening ahead of me. I'm sorry, ma'am, your card was declined again. Do you want to try a different payment method? I looked up from my phone. A woman about my age wearing scrubs with Maria embroidered on them was standing there with her teenage son. He couldn't have been older than 15, wearing a faded band T-shirt and holding her hand supportively. Um, let me try this one, Maria said, pulling out a different card. Her hands were shaking slightly. Sorry, Miguel. I thought I had enough after paying rent. This one declined too, the employee said gently. The boy immediately stepped forward. It's okay, mom. I don't really need new earbuds for school. My old ones still work fine for online classes. Maria's shoulders sagged like someone had just crushed her dreams. Miho, you've been using those broken earbuds for two years. The left one doesn't even work anymore. And you need them for your virtual music lessons. Maybe next month I'll have Better tips from work, she said, her voice cracking. Your music teacher said you have real talent. You deserve proper equipment. Mom, sharing one earbud with my study group is fine. Besides, my music sounds better when we listen to.

So I drove him straight into another state while he slept. Mr Maya was the kind of teacher who got off on making students miserable. In AP history, he'd lean over your desk during tests, breathing coffee breath down your neck while tapping his pen on your paper, just throw you off. And when he handed back essays drowned in red ink, he'd always had his favorite line. In the real world, this wouldn't fly. I spent all junior year counting down to summer, marking days off my calendar like a prisoner, thinking I'd finally be free of his polyester blazers and power trips. So when I walked into driver's ed two weeks later and saw him sitting behind the instructor's desk, my, it dropped like a stone. Where do I turn, I asked during our first lesson, gripping the wheel nervously. You don't turn unless I say to, he barked, making me swerve slightly. Just assume you're going straight until I say otherwise, though with your steering. Straight is a pretty loose term. The two other girls in the backseat exchange looks through the rearview mirror. When Sophia gripped the wheel too tight, he chuckled. Death grip won't help you drive better, sweetheart. This isn't a strength test. Emily stalled at a stop sign and he slapped his knee laughing. And this is why I keep my seatbelt extra tight with you girls. Never know when we're Gonna stop or if we're gonna stop. By the third lesson we discovered his pattern. He'd make his nasty jokes for 20 minutes then use the afternoon drives as nap time while we practice highway driving. Don't worry about that curb you just kissed. He's when I've beard slightly, I'm sure it'll recover from the trauma unlike my neck. When Sophia asked about parallel parking, he laughed. You can barely handle forward parking and you wanna try parallel? That's adorable. He spent the entire next lesson bragging about his important dinner plans with his wife if we survive today's lesson. That is 3 teenage girls driving. I should update my will. One afternoon Sophia slightly veered and he exploded. Jesus, are you trying to collect mailboxes? Cause you're doing great. He wiped tears from laughing so hard. You know girls like you three are why insurance rates are so high and why driving instructors need hazard pay. It's funny because it's true. Then he made his final comparison. My 5 year old nephew has better control of his big wheel than you girls have of this car. He was still chuckling when he added, just try not to kill us while I and then he was snoring head tilted back against the headrest, looked at Emily and Sophia in the rearview mirror and something passed between us. That's when I realized he told me to never turn unless he said so. The interstate entrance was coming up on the right And I could see the big green sign marking I ninety five North hanging over the highway. Like a dare, I tilted my head slightly toward it and Emily caught my glance, following my eyes to the sign before whispering. I didn't hear him say turn, while Sophia nodded slowly and added, me neither. I glanced down at the fuel gauge showing a full tank, then back at the sleeping Mister Maya. And as we approached the on ramp and I felt the car naturally wanting to continue straight onto the interstate, I took a deep breath and tightened my grip on the wheel. Well, he did say to follow his instructions exactly. The merge onto the interstate was smooth and Mister Maya kept snoring while the highway stretched endlessly ahead. Thirty minutes passed, then an hour and his phone started buzzing in the cup holder with increasing frequency. We passed the welcome to New Jersey sign after two hours, making Emily stifle a nervous giggle as his phone lit up constantly with white.

I paid for this so I'm keeping it moment. My ex wife Emma thought she was so clever during our divorce. We've been married eight years and when things went south, she hired this shark lawyer who promised to take me for everything I had. The divorce was brutal. She wanted the house, both cars, half my business and spousal support. Her lawyer kept saying I was hiding assets and demanded access to all my financial records going back five years. But there was one thing Emma really wanted, my signed Jersey collection. I've been collecting them since high school. Mickey Mantle, Joe Montana, Michael Jordan, worth about $30,000 total. Emma hated that collection, always called it my stupid sports shrine and said it was a waste of money. But now that we were splitting up, suddenly she wanted half of everything, including jerseys she'd mocked for years. Her lawyer argued that since we bought some of them during the marriage, she was entitled to 50% of the collection. The Mickey Mantle alone was worth 12 grand. I tried explaining that most of these were gifts for my dad or things I'd saved up for with my own money before we even met. Didn't matter. Her lawyer wanted receipts for everything. So I spent weeks digging through old boxes, finding every receipt, every certificate of authenticity, every piece of paper that proved when and how I got each Jersey. That's when I found something interesting, the Michael Jordan Jersey, the crown jewel of my collection, worth $15,000. I had the original receipt from 2019, but it wasn't purchased by me. It was purchased by Emma as a surprise for my fortyth birthday. She'd spent months tracking it down through collectors, paid full price, even had it professionally framed. I'll never forget her face when my lawyer presented that receipt in court. She went completely white as he explained that according to her own legal argument, she just proved the most valuable item in my collection legally belonged to her. Her lawyer tried to backtrack, saying it was a gift and gifts don't count. But my lawyer was ready. He pulled out the divorce papers where Emma's team had specifically argued that the source of payment determined ownership, not the intent. The judge looked annoyed. He asked Emma's lawyer if they wanted to change their legal strategy, which would mean starting the entire asset division process over again. That would cost them another six months and 20,000 in legal fees. Emma was trapped by her own greed. If she backed down, she'd lose her claim to everything else. If she pushed forward, she'd have to give me the Jordan Jersey. While fighting for jerseys worth half as much, her lawyer whispered something in her ear. She shook her head violently. They whispered more. Finally, she slumped back in her chair, looking defeated. Fine, she said through gritted teeth. He can keep his stupid jerseys. But I wasn't done. I Stood up and addressed the judge directly. I'd like to make a counter offer regarding the Michael Jordan Jersey. Everyone looked confused. My own lawyer didn't know what I was planning. According to the receipt, my ex wife purchased this Jersey. According to her legal argument, that makes it hers. I don't want to take something that doesn't belong to me. Emma's eyes lit up. She thought I was giving her a 15 thousand dollar dollar victory. However, I continued. I'd like to.

I was the only night keeper at our aquarium who could handle Poseidon, our four million dollar giant Pacific octopus. And that evening he wrapped all eight arms around my forearm to gently pull crab from my beating tongues. His massive 200 pound body moved with surprising Grace through the crystal clear water of his tank. But when any other keeper approached, the same gentle creature became a destructive nightmare that sprayed black ink everywhere and destroyed thousands of dollars worth of equipment. Our new operations director Caroline watched from the observation deck with her arms crossed, clearly unimpressed by what she called my animal dependency problem during yesterday's staff meeting. She believed every creature should have multiple handlers because no single employee should be irreplaceable, especially not because of some oversized sea creature that cost more than most people's houses. Caroline has spent three weeks documenting every minor violation she manufacturer. Writing me up for wearing a different brand of reef safe sunscreen than the one corporate required, even though their brand gave me hives and docking my pay when Poseidon's complex eating routine ran five minutes over my scheduled break. Her masterpiece was hiring Tim, her former assistant manager who spent entire shifts taking Instagram selfies near the shark tank and had never worked with cephalopods in his 24 years of existence. Poseidon hated Tim with the burning intensity of a thousand suns shooting pressurized water jets That soaked him completely whenever he approached the tank. And once Tim slept so dramatically on the wet observation deck that he crashed through a three thousand dollar interactive display about octopus intelligence, Tim's solution was to stand 15 feet away from the tank and throw food pellets like he was feeding pigeons at the park, which made Poseidon retreat to his cave and refuse to eat for two entire days. Then disaster struck on Wednesday evening when major marine research donors were arriving for a private feeding demonstration at 8:30, specifically to see our famous octopus interact with his primary caregiver. Twenty minutes before the VIP tour, Caroline cornered me in the equipment room while I prepared Poseidon's dinner of fresh dungeness crab and puzzle feeders. Tim will handle tonight's demonstration, she announced with fake authority dripping from every word. You're needed in the children's touch tank area for deep cleaning duties. Everyone in that equipment room knew exactly what would happen if Tim approached Poseidon during feeding time, when the octopus was most territorial and aggressive. But I looked Caroline directly in the eyes and explained, obvious anyway, the sign won't accept food from Tim and he becomes violent when strangers approach during his dinner routine. Caroline snapped back that we'd manage without the feeding demonstration and gave me a direct order to report to the children's area immediately or face consequences. I slowly unclipped my security badge and identification card, placing both items on the stainless Steel prep counter. While our senior aquarist and two night staff members watched this confrontation unfold in stunned silence, I pulled out my phone to start recording and told Caroline that the sign was in full hunting mode because it was feeding time and Tim knew where all the equipment was stored. Caroline's face turned bright red when she realized I was documenting our conversation for legal purposes. If you walk out of this building, you're terminated immediately and permanently. I replied calmly that this was perfectly fine with me, already hearing Poseidon's agitated flashing echoing from the deep sea exit two rooms away. I'm recording this for unemployment documentation since you're firing me for refusing to endanger a 4 million dollar animal and potentially injure your completely inexperienced employee. I walked out of the building and barely made it to the parking lot before my phone started buzzing with frantic calls and text messages. Twelve missed calls came in during the first four minutes, starting with panicked messages from our senior Aquarius describing how Poseidon had grabbed Tim's entire arm through the feeding spot and refused to let go no matter.

Logan had been complaining for weeks that I hovered too much. When we went out at his company's holiday party, he pulled me aside near the coat check. Listen. Tonight, can you just not be so attached to me? My coworkers think it's weird how you're always by my side. Just mingle on your own. For once, I smiled sweetly. Of course, babe, I'll give you tons of space. Really? You're not upset? Not at all. You want independence at parties? You got it. The party was at this upscale rooftop venue, open bar, DJ, the Works. Logan immediately ditched me to bro out with his work buddies, leaving me by the entrance. Perfect. I walked straight to the bar where his boss, Thomas, was getting drinks. Emily, where's Logan? Oh, he wanted space. Tonight, I'm flying solo. Thomas looked confused at his own company party. He says I'm too clingy, didn't want me cramping his style. Thomas's wife, Diane overheard. He left you alone. How rude. No worries. I'll just entertain myself. And I did. I ended up in a fascinating conversation with the CFO about cryptocurrency. Then the head of HR pulled me into their group to settle a debate about true crime podcasts. I was having a genuinely great time. An hour in, I caught Logan's eye across the room. He was with his bros but kept glancing over As I laughed with his supervisors, then the DJ started playing salsa music. This gorgeous guy from Accounting, Javier, asked if I could dance. I'd love to. We tore up that dance floor. Turns out Javier was a semi professional dancer. He spun me, dipped me the whole nine yards. A crowd formed to watch. Logan appeared suddenly. Hey, maybe we should, oh, am I being too clingy? I asked mid spin. No, I just, great. Then you won't mind if I keep dancing. Javier dipped me dramatically. Crowd cheered. Logan retreated to the bar Downing whiskey with his confused buddies. Later, the CEO's wife pulled me aside. You're Logan's girlfriend. We need to talk. She dragged me to her table full of executives wives. They immediately adopted me, pouring champagne and gossiping about everyone. Logan usually brags about you non stop. One said, where is he? He needed guy time. Apparently I hover. They exchanged looks. Men are idiots, the CEO's wife declared, raising her glass. Toasted to that. Logan kept trying to approach, but every time he got close, someone else would pull me into conversation. His female co workers wanted workout tips. The it guys needed restaurant recommendations. Even the janitor asked for relationship advice. Everyone loved me except Logan who looked increasingly miserable. Then came the speeches. CEO grabbed the mic thanking everyone for their hard work. Special shout out to Emily for bringing such amazing energy tonight. Logan, you're a lucky man. Everyone clapped looking Around for Logan. He was sulking by the bathroom. Where's Logan? The CEO asked into the mic. He wanted space, someone yelled. Laughter erupted. The CEO's wife grabbed the mic. Well, his loss. Emily's been the life of the party. More cheering. Logan's face went red. Around midnight, the party was winding down. I was ex.

After watching my dad hit my mom for years, I finally hit him back and ended up in a psych ward. They classified me as violent. So I spent 7 months in a white room with nothing but my thoughts. When I was finally released, all I wanted was a family of my own, one built on love, not fear. That's how I met Noah. He was 6, living in a group home after being removed from his fourth foster placement. The social worker warned me he was challenging, code for traumatized. But when I saw him sitting alone, methodically lining up broken crayons by size, something in my heart cracked open. I sat down beside him and asked what he was drawing. Without looking up, he said a house with no yelling. I noticed burn marks on his arms, perfectly circular cigarette burns. I had similar scars, only mine were from my dad's cigars. The first few weeks were rough. Noah tested every boundary, waiting for me to snap. He'd break things, scream that he hated me, try to run away. But I never raised my voice, never threatened, never hit. Instead, I'd sit with him during his meltdowns, speaking softly until his breathing steadied. One night, I found him in the kitchen at 3 a. M. Stuffing cereal into his pockets. I'm not mad, I said, keeping my distance. But can you tell me why his voice was barely A whisper in case you change your mind about me. Like everyone else, I opened the pantry, showing him the extra shelves I'd installed. This is your food, too. You'll never go hungry here, I promise. Slowly, things improved. He started sleeping through the night, stopped hoarding food, called me dad for the first time after I spent hours helping him build a blanket fort. Then he showed up at our door claiming he changed, found god wanted his son. Noah hid under his bed when he heard that voice, shaking so hard the frame rattled. The custody battle was brutal. His father had family money, hired expensive lawyers. They painted me as unstable because of my psych ward. Stay said a single man couldn't properly raise a traumatized child. But Noah's therapist testified about his progress. His teachers described his transformation from a silent, scared kid to an engaged student who helped younger children. The judge listened. The final hearing was yesterday. Noah squeezed my hand so tight it hurt as his father made one last plea. Then the judge looked at Noah and asked what he wanted. He stood up straight, looked his birth father in the eye and said, I already have a dad, the kind who builds forts and doesn't hurt people. Walking out of that courthouse, adoption papers finally signed no. It turned to me, can we get ice cream? Of course, buddy. Dad. Those other foster homes, they said I was too broken. That No one would want to keep me. I knelt down, meeting his eyes. You were never broken. You were waiting for someone who understood. At night, I heard him crying in his room. When I checked on him, he was organizing his crayons again. But this time, he was drawing our house with both of us inside, smiling. See, he said, pointing, no yelling. Now, whenever Noah has a hard day, we build a fort.

Hi. Can I speak to Michelle, please? This is Michelle. Hey, Michelle. How are you? This is Jubal from Brook and Jubal in the morning. Brooke and Jubal, like the radio show? Yeah, just like that. How are you? Well, I'm much better now. What are you guys doing calling me? Um, nothing. Just calling people that let you. Obviously, you listen to the show. That's cool. We're just calling to check in with people, see how they're doing. It's part of our service. Yeah, right. Haha. I'm actually calling you because somebody emailed us about you. Oh, God. Tell me this is not a freaking second date update. I'd love to do that, but it is a second date update. Oh, God. And you recently went out with a guy named Jay. Oh my God. Haha. You're calling me about Jay? Yes, I am. Jay emailed us and told us about your date, said that it was really awkward because his co worker came along. And then after the date, he texted you like, hey, I'm sorry about that. We should try it again. And you texted him back that you weren't interested. Yeah, that's. I can't believe that he told you all that. Well, he obviously liked you a lot and wants to see you again. So what's the reason that you told him it wouldn't possibly work? Well, he told you how the friend came along, right? Yes, he did. He said his coworker showed up. And cried pretty much the whole time. Yeah. That is that not enough? So is that the only reason that you're not calling him back? Because of his coworker? No, the coworker cried the whole time. And to comfort him, he started to saying horrible things about the girl. I mean, she wasn't even there to defend herself. And he's like, well, you know, she was kind of fat so you can do better. Wait, wow, wait. I was there. He was trash talking to his co worker's ex. Yes. Oh, you can do better. I mean, she has a nice set of boobs, but that's all. And he was saying this in front of you and what were you doing? I was like, yeah, I hope it gets better for you. There's more out there. But can't you give them. I mean, you can throw a bone on that one. It's not like you've never comforted a girlfriend by talking about what a loser her ex was. Bro talk on a date. Yeah, I wouldn't say that. I wouldn't say that in front of another girl. Be like, oh, dude, she's a waste. You're saying horrible. Like she had man hands. You don't want her. I mean, and then the part where I was like, okay, I need to leave is when they started asking me for friends because the best way to get over someone is to get under someone else. Haha. So he was asking if you Had any friends that his buddy could hook up with? Okay, can you call somebody and get them here right away? Oh my God. So that maybe he can sleep with someone. Really? Yeah. That's when I was like, okay, I'm gonna see you later. He actually asked you if you had a friend that would sleep with him. Yes. And could I get them on the phone right now? Oh my god. That is. What was your response to that? I was horrified and disgusted and I tried to extricate myself from the situation and said I need to leave. Was there like anything enjoyable about the date? I mean, it was funny on the outside. I'm glad I wasn't you know, emotionally involved at that point. Did you ever for once think about a friend you're like, oh, I bet you she'd do it and then almost call them? No, no, no, not at all. Can't even go there. Okay, so Michelle, I know that it sounds like you're a listener to the show and I don't know how many second date updates you listen to, but maybe you forgot that Jay is actually on the other line listening right now. No, I figured that was coming. I'm glad that he got to hear all that. Oh, okay, Jay. Well, you know, you there? Yeah, I'm here. Haha. Pretty harsh recap, Jay. Listen to what she just said.

I care about my teenage boy, but I'd be dishonest if I said I wasn't let down by the kind of person he's becoming. My son began getting into this different look back when he was in middle school. At first he just wore black clothes, but once he got to high school, he's gone way too far with his strange style and I really don't like it. My wife doesn't seem to mind, but she's a pretty passive woman and has never been a very strict parent like me. If I were to describe how my son dresses now, he wears big, baggy black clothing and lots of chains and rings. At one point, he was even dying coloured strips into his hair. I remember being so upset the first day I saw this. It was just so embarrassing to see my child walking around like that. Now, I don't have a problem with gay people or anything like that, but I never really wanted that type of thing to be a part of my own household. I've never confronted my son about his sexuality and I really just don't wanna know if he does happen to be. Our relationship is already sort of strained and I feel like if I found out he wasn't straight, it would make it very hard for me to treat him the same. Like I said, I don't have a problem with gay people. I just don't wanna be shoved in my face on top of everything. Ever since my son entered high school, he's made friends with mostly girls. At first I was glad to see this, and I was happy that my son still might have a chance of growing up into a real man's man. But as time went on, I realised that he wasn't in a relationship with any of these girls dead. They were all just his close friends. He constantly has his friends over the house and is part of a friend group with three other girls. To be fair, these girls have always been nothing but polite to me and my wife and are always respectful of our house. Still, it just rubs me the wrong way that my son doesn't seem to have any close guy friends, and I feel like it's not good for him to grow up that way. I tried my best to be non judgmental towards my son, even though to me he looked like more of a freak of nature. Every day the more he kept leaning into his alternative fashion. I didn't understand it, since all of his friends were normal girls. He was the only weirdo in his friend group who dressed like some 90s mall rat. When I look at him, he honestly reminds me of the kind of kids I would pick on in high school. Anyway, about a Year ago, I ran out of patience with him when he came home one day with his nails painted a shade of bright blue. My son had never done anything like this before, and I couldn't help but feel overwhelmingly disgusted. I. I told him that he had gone too far with his emo bullshit and that I couldn't continue letting him make a fool out of himself like this. I told him that at one point he needed to become a man, and painting his nails made him look like some sort of weak top. My son and I had never really been close. We didn't even speak that often, so he looked very hurt as I was telling him all this. But I couldn't help it. He had needed a reality check for so long and there was no avoiding this conversation. I told my son to go get nail polish remover and remove his nail polish right there in front of me. That's when he started to get angry and said that he didn't have to change himself just to appease my dumb homophobic self. My son has never spoken to either of his parents this way, and I knew that there was no way I was letting him get away with it. I yelled at him for cursing at me like that, and I told him that he would remove his nail polish immediately or there would be serious consequences. He said that there was nothing Worse I could do to him than continue being such a hateful father. And that's when I lost my shot. I told him that I would ground him for the entire year if he didn't remove his nail polish within the next 60 seconds. Looked at me and told me that I could try, but I would never be able to control him and that he hated me. He ran up to his room after this, and I followed through on my threat. I took his phone away and replaced it with a flip phone, and he wasn't allowed to go out or have his friends over anymore. All he did after that for the rest of the year was call his friends in his room and completely ignore me. One night, I overheard him crying to my wife about how much he hated his life since being grounded. But all she said was that I was his father and he needed to respect me. Proud of my wife for sticking up to me behind closed doors. And I still felt like I had made the right decision. I won't lie and say that it hasn't been a difficult year. My son stopped talking to me the day I grounded him, and I honestly do miss him. He graduates next year, and I just hope before then he'll realise that I was only ever trying to do what was best for him.

I need extra hands. Yeah, I don't think so. I wasn't about to climb into a bathroom stall with a freak. No, please. I think I might bleed out. Her voice was shaking. And suddenly this wasn't funny anymore. It was summer from my English class, a pregnant senior who everyone whispered about but nobody really talked to. She was sitting on the toilet, gripping the handicap rail with white knuckles, and her face was covered in sweat. What's wrong? I asked, even though I was starting to guess. Please do something. I'm giving birth. She looked up at me with pure terror in her eyes. My whole body went cold. I was 17 and barely knew how tampons worked, let alone babies. But she was crying and alone, and I couldn't just leave her there. I hopped over the stall divider awkwardly and almost slipped on the wet floor. That's when I saw it. The baby was already crowning. There was blood on the toilet seat and the floor, and summer was making the low groaning sounds that scared me more than anything. This was actually happening in a gross school bathroom with fluorescent lights and graffiti on the walls. I'll be right back. I ran out of the bathroom. Still in shock. I sprinted down the hallway to Missus Bashar's classroom. She was my favourite teacher and The only adult I could think of who wouldn't freak out, I burst through her door, interrupting her lecture on photosynthesis. The whole class stared at me. I need your help urgently, please. I was out of breath and probably looked insane. Missus Bashar took one look at my face and followed me without asking questions. We ran back to the bathroom and I could hear summer sounds getting louder. Other kids were starting to peek out of classrooms wondering what was happening. Missus Bashar pushed open the stall door and immediately went into teacher mode. Okay, honey, I'm here. You're doing great. I'm going to support you while she gets the nurse. I didn't need to be told twice. I ran to the nurse's office faster than I'd ever run in PE. When I burst through the door, Nurse Patty was checking Casey's temperature. Casey, who everyone knew was Summer's boyfriend, the guy who'd been bragging about becoming a dad at prom. Summer's having her baby in the bathroom right now. I basically screamed it. Casey's face went from white to green. He threw up all over the floor before Nurse Patty could grab a trash can. But we didn't have time to deal with that. The three of us ran back to the bathroom with nurse Patty grabbing emergency supplies from her cabinet. By now, half the school had heard something was happening. Kids were crowding outside the bathroom door trying to figure out what all the screaming Was about teachers were trying to move them back to class, but nobody was listening. When we got back to the stall, it was chaos. Missus Bashar was holding Summer's hand while she pushed. The nurse immediately took over, checking how dilated she was and telling summer to breathe. Casey stood frozen in the doorway looking like he might pass out. That's when summer grabbed my hand and pulled me close. You have to get.

Why do you need to know so bad? I don't need to know. I just wanna know. Because you are the only person making this type of noise in the complex. I'm surprised everyone isn't complaining about you. And I told you I'm almost done. After that, you won't need to hear from me again. Oh my. Alright, just finish up. It's 8:00. You have an hour. Okay. And gosh, turn off that music. Sounds like a screeching cat. What? No way you can listen to that! I have to. You don't understand. You're so annoying. Okay, Today is the day you told me you would be finished. I will in a couple of hours. Are you at least going to show me what the hell it is that you've been doing all this time? I could, but you have to promise not to make fun of it. Sure.

My girlfriend was so insane that she told everyone that we broke up because I cheated on her in her dream. She was a spoiled rich girl who came from a terrible snobby family. They were the kind of people who would wipe their butts with hundred dollar bills if they ran out of toilet paper. If she and I ever got into an argument, she would run back to her daddy who would send her on a week long vacation to Cancun just so she could recover from our arguments. And one of these week long vacations to Cancun, she ended up getting pregnant from one of the six hotel staff she cheated on me with. But when she came back, instead of telling me, she told me that she was breaking up with me because she had a dream in Mexico that I would cheat on her. At this point I was so over the relationship that I didn't care if it ended. After I moved out and moved back to my parents house, I got a call from an anonymous number. When I I picked up the phone, it was my ex girlfriend's father. He called to say you broke my baby girl's heart. Now I'm going to break your head. I'd sleep with one eye open if I were you. I told him whatever and for him and his crazy family to leave me alone. Truthfully, I was scared of him. I knew he had enough money to hire whoever he wanted to do whatever he wanted. When I applied for a new job, I noticed someone was watching me at the office. They weren't just watching me, they were staring. When I left the building, I saw them following behind. I started to look around, and that's when I saw a black van with two men inside it, also watching me. I've seen enough movies to know what that meant. I didn't waste any time. I started running as fast as I could. I ended up running into a park where I found a police officer. I alerted him and told him that I was being followed by three men. I thought that he would help me, but instead he told me to put my hands behind my back and that I was being arrested. I demanded that he tell me why I was being arrested, but he told me to shut my broke ass up. The second he called me broke, I realized that this was all my ex's father I was doing. He paid the cop off to arrest me. At this point, I didn't even fight back. The cop put me in his cop car, and just as I thought, he brought me to my ex girlfriend's estate. When he threw me out of the car, my girlfriend's father was waiting for me, sipping tea like a James Bond villain. I asked him if he was going To take my life away. And all he said was, we need to talk. I followed him inside and passed by my girlfriend, who was getting her feet done. Her father sat me down and there was trembling in his voice. My babe

I thought everyone heard the vacuum cleaner screaming when it turned on. For years. My parents told me I was being dramatic when I covered my ears during everyday stuff. Turns out I wasn't dramatic at all. When I was little, probably like 3 or 4, I'd always ask my mom why the T. V. Was so loud. She check the volume and it would be on like 15 which is pretty normal, but to me it sounded like someone was yelling in my ear. My parents thought I was just being a weird kid. As I got older, things got worse. I started wearing these chunky noise cancelling headphones to school assemblies because the microphone feedback made me wanna throw up. During fire drills I would literally hide under my desk crying because the alarm felt like someone was stabbing my eardrums with a fork. The school nurse started calling my parents saying I was having panic attacks during normal school activities. My mom took me to our family doctor when I was 8. He did the basic hearing test where you raise your hand when you hear the beep. My hearing was perfect so he said I probably had anxiety. That's when the real nightmare started. Every little sound became torture. The microwave beeping sounded like a fire truck Siren. When my dad would start his car in the garage, I could feel The engine vibrations in my chest, and it made me dizzy and sick. Stopped eating dinner with my family because the sound of forks scraping plates made me want to scream. My parents were getting frustrated with me. My mom would say stuff like, normal people don't get panic attacks from the dishwasher running. My dad thought I was making it up for attention. They sent me to a counselor who gave me breathing exercises and told me to download meditation apps. By the time I turned 14, I couldn't function anymore. I stopped riding in cars because the engine noise made me nauseous. Showers hurt my ears so bad, I could only take them for, like, two minutes. I couldn't go to restaurants because the sound of people talking mixed with plates clinking. Sounded like metal scraping against metal. One day during sophomore year, we had a fire drill, and I completely lost it. I collapsed in the hallway, sobbing and shaking. The sound was so overwhelming, I thought my head was going to explode. Three teachers had to carry me to the nurse's office. Most of my teachers thought I was being overdramatic, but my substitute science teacher, Mrs. Lopez

Ever since my son Leo was a little kid, he was just awful to other children. At 5 years old, he was kicked out of kindergarten for backing other kids into corners just to watch them cry. When our daughter Mia was born, keeping Leo away from her was a full time job. We had to move her crib into our bedroom and lock the door just to keep her secure. Later, when Mia was old enough to start losing her baby teeth, we did the whole tooth fairy thing. She put a tooth under her pillow and wake up to a few dollars. But every single morning, after showing us the money, she'd tell us the tooth itself was missing. My husband and I never touched them. Around that same time, Leo claimed the old shed in our backyard as his clubhouse and told us to stay out. But I'm his mother. So one day, I went in to see what he was up to. I found all of Mia's missing teeth laid out in a neat little row on his workbench. Cold feeling wash over me. When we confronted him about it, he just lost it. He screamed horrible things at us before locking himself in his room for three straight days. Over the years, we tried therapy, and he was kicked out of several schools. It wasn't until high school that we saw just how risky he was. One Afternoon a girl from his class knocked on our door. She looked terrified. She told me Leo had been following her home from school every day. She said she was scared for her life and didn't know who else to turn to because no one would listen. My stomach sank. I heard the real fear in her voice, and I apologized over and over. I promised I would talk to him, but deep down I knew it wouldn't do any good. Nothing I said ever did. That afternoon, when I mentioned the girl, he exploded. He started flipping chairs and throwing things across the kitchen. I had to run and lock myself in our bedroom to get away from him. The last thing I heard was him screaming, you'll all pay for this! Before he slammed the back door and went to the shed. I stayed in my room until my husband got home. He saw the broken kitchen window and the mess from Leo's fit and got mad. I'll go talk to him, said. Maybe he'll listen to his father. Then he walked out to the shed. A minute later, I heard a scream that I will never forget. I ran outside and found my husband on his knees in the grass, just crying. He looked up at me and whispered, don't go in there, but I had to see. I ran right past him. When I opened the shed door, I saw him.

The first time I walked in on it I thought something was wrong. He looked at me all calm and said I'm just mentally preparing. I've never looked at showers the same way. 2. I found out men treat fridges like treasure hunts. He'll open it five times in a row, stare like something new is going to spawn, sigh dramatically, and then eat plain cheese straight from the block. I once asked why he keeps checking. He said in case a snack magically appears. Three I didn't know guys hum to themselves during the most random tasks. My boyfriend will be cleaning the sink, humming what sounds like boss battle music, then suddenly switch to singing about how this sponge is my sword. I caught it on video once and he begged me not to post it. 4. They'll wear the same hoodie for a month straight like it's a second skin. When I suggested washing it, he looked genuinely confused and said but it still smells like me, so it's fine. 5. They will absolutely keep random screws or wires in a just in case drawer. I asked why. He said because you never know when you'll need this. It was a bent nail. 6 point 10. They make sound effects for everything. Opening jars, throwing socks in the laundry, even getting up from the couch. Suddenly he's making rocket launch noises. 7. They'll stand in front of the mirror flexing, not realizing you can see them. The second they notice, they pretend they were checking their posture. 8. They'll eat an entire meal over the sink just to save dishes, and apparently that's normal to them. 9. They'll absolutely risk breaking a limb before making two trips from the car. Groceries stacked to their chin, wobbling like a Jenga tower, but proud. 10. They can sit in total silence for an hour staring at the wall, and when you ask what they're thinking about, they say nothing. And somehow they really mean nothing.

And why do they act like they're the CEO of everything? The group project, they did nothing but somehow got the most credit. Party. They didn't even host it, but they still say, oh my god, our party was so fun. They're not even popular. Everyone is just scared of them. Like if you make eye contact for too long, they'll scan your outfit, judge your entire existence and sentence you to eternal hallway awkwardness. Nah, bro. Popular girls are like NPCs with Main Character Syndrome. Total idiots, loud and everywhere. Follow for more daily rants.

I've been going to the same tattoo shop for about seven years and got work done every few months. My artist, Derek, was always really laid back and liked doing challenging pieces. He'd done my whole sleeve and my back piece and everything. You're basically my canvas at this point. He'd always joke, but this time I wanted to cover up my ex's name on my shoulder blade. I sat in his chair that Thursday afternoon and told him I wanted a black mandala over it. Derek nodded and said, easy next. I've done hundreds of these. He got the stencil ready and started setting up his machine. Everything seemed normal at first. He was talking about this new ink he'd gotten and asking about my new job and all that usual talk. The buzzing of the machine was almost relaxing. About two weeks later, though, something felt weird during the healing. I was checking it in the mirror, and the texture didn't feel right. I could feel raised bumps that spelled out letters when I ran my fingers over it. I went back to the shop that Saturday morning and showed Derek. He looked at it for maybe 10 seconds and then took a step back. His eyebrows went up, and he tilted his head to the side, staring at my shoulder blade. Let me get you in the chair under the light, he said, and his voice Was quieter than usual. He put on gloves and ran his fingers over the tattoo once, then again, then a third time. He kept tracing the same spots over and over, and then just stood there shaking his head. The name Nathan was rising through the black mandala in these raised ridges. They weren't scar or keloids, but actual raised ink pushing up through the new tattoo. Derek stepped back on the chair and asked, have you ever had any healing problems before? I told him, never. All my other tattoos healed totally flat. The ridges were only where the old name was, maybe half an inch tall for each letter, but they were really obvious and you could read. Made it through the black ink like rail. He called over the shop owner, Tony, who'd been tattooing for 35 years. Tony took one look and right away said, I need to know if you have any allergies or skin conditions. I told him, no, I was perfectly healthy. He started asking weird questions about whether the original tattoo was done somewhere sketchy, or if I'd had any reactions when I first got it. The thing was, I got the original at a good place three years ago. No problems at all when I got it. My skin had always healed great. These raised ridges made no sense. Derek kept touching it with his gloved fingers and tracing the letters. He said, in all his years and thousands of cover UPS. He'd never seen old ink push through new ink like this. Texture felt like hard plastic under the skin. Totally different from normal scar tissue. Derek was really confused and said, look, I think we should try going deeper with even thicker black. I figured, why not? Maybe it just needed more ink. He went deeper this time and really packed the ink in there. The whole shop was watching. Now other artists kept coming over between their clients because everyone wanted to see this weird thing happening with my skin. Someone said maybe it was the type of ink that was used originally, but Derek checked his records, and it was the same.

I've been keeping this notebook for six years, and my girlfriend had no clue until last week. She always said I never opened up emotionally, but honestly, I just thought guys weren't supposed to talk about all the little things they notice. Growing up, my dad forgot everyone's birthday. My mom couldn't remember who liked what food. Their fights were brutal because nobody paid attention to anyone. I swore I'd never be that type of boyfriend. So in college, I started writing stuff down about whoever I was dating. Not weird stalker stuff, just normal things. Like how Ashley preferred hot chocolate when it rained, but iced coffee when it was sunny. Or how Jessica's voice got higher when she was nervous about something. When I met Mia three years ago, the notebook got way more detailed. I wrote down everything. How she stirred her cereal exactly seven times before eating it. How she hummed the same tune when she was happy. How her left eyebrow twitched right before she'd start laughing at something. Every few weeks, I'd add new stuff, like how she only wore her lucky socks on job interview days. Or how she needed exactly eight minutes of silence when she got home from work before she could handle talking. I wrote down that she liked her apartment at exactly 72 degrees, not 71 or 73. That she always ordered extra pickles but never ate them. That she got cranky. If she didn't eat something by 11:00am, but never admitted she was hungry, the notebook helped me figure out when to give her space and when to push her to talk about stuff, when to play upbeat music, and when she needed something sad. I knew she was stressed when she started reorganizing her bookshelf, so I'd order her favorite Thai food before she even realized she was hungry. When she was upset, she'd clean the bathroom obsessively, so I'd run her a bath afterward. None of this felt calculated or weird to me. It just seemed like paying attention. But I never told her about it because it sounded super intense when I thought about explaining it. Like, hey, hey, babe, I've been documenting your behavior patterns for three years. Doesn't exactly sound romantic. Plus, guys don't really talk about this stuff with each other. I figured she'd think I was some kind of control freak or something. Last Tuesday, she was cleaning our home office while I was at work. She called me freaking out, asking why I had a notebook with her name on it hidden behind my desk. I panicked, thinking she'd found something embarrassing, but she said she hadn't opened it yet. She was waiting for me to get home to explain. The drive home felt like forever. I kept imagining her thinking I was documenting her flaws or planning to break up with her or something crazy. When I got there, she was sitting On the

Elliot leaned in so close our breaths mingled and asked, how do I get close to your best friend? Elliot was the kind of gorgeous that made girls walk into lockers, but he sat there looking genuinely lost. I've never been on a date, he admitted. I almost laughed because he'd had at least three Valentine's offers this year alone. You literally have girls throwing themselves at you, I said. He shrugged. Sure, but it's different when I'm the one doing the chasing. I just freeze. I want this proposal to go well. That's when I realised he wasn't playing dumb. He actually didn't understand. He was attractive enough to where planning a proposal wasn't even necessary. But then again, the girl he wanted to take was none other than the most beautiful, full, talented, intelligent girl in the school. My best friend, Bian, with green eyes and light brown hair and an acceptance letter to Yale. There was nothing missing from her. Elliot slid over a small envelope. Here's my bride. I almost started hyperventilating. Comic Con weekend tickets and a free hotel. Holy Mother of all! I shook his hand enthusiastically. Three weeks. I'll teach you everything in three weeks. First week we studied the basics. After school, I taught him to how give compliments without sounding like he was reading from a script. Notice the small things, I said. New earrings if she looks tired. If She changed her hair. He was clumsy at first. Great haircut. You look pretty beautiful. I burst into laughter while he glared back. Compliments aren't about the adjectives you use. It's the heart, the sound, the honesty. He nodded, then looked me in the eyes. I like the way your eyes get brighter when you talk about something you love. My face flushed as he grinned. That's good. I managed. Say that for Vianne. The practice continued, and by the end of the week he was a complimenting machine, and I was immune to his one liners. Well, almost immune. By week two we moved on to actual romancing. We met up for a picnic at a popular dating spot, became competitive at bowling, and hung out at his place to watch movies. In the evening we practiced slow dancing in the garage, stepping on each other's toes for fun. It's a pretty great. I don't know why I kept freezing up before, he said, spinning me around. That's because most people our age do way more on dates. I made kissy sounds in his ear, and he jumped back, staring daggers at me for teasing him. I grinned as he helped me back up. Let's practice slow dancing, too, he suggested, slipping his arms to my waist, carefully making the heart of my chest pound wildly. Is this okay? He breathed against my hair. I could barely breathe, let alone answer. The night before the proposal, I helped him Pick out his outfit and style his hair exactly the way beyond preferred. Do I look good? For a second I forgot how to speak. You're like a prince, I breathed, and quickly added, that's what Vianne would say. We did one final practice run in the park. He strung up fairy lights and held onto my hand, gently stroking the back of it with his thumb. I stared up at him, at the large brown eyes sprinkled with golden speckles from the fairy lights, and smiled. He leaned in slowly, but just as I closed my eyes, he paused, dropping my hands, and took a step back. Vianne's going to love this. Reality crashed back hard. My heart squeezed painfully while I forced myself to agree. I think you'll do perfectly, I reminded him. Comic con was the same weekend as prom. No, he said. Thanks for bullying me. I mean teaching me. He winked and pulled me into one last tight hug. Enjoy Comic Con. I squeezed back. Enjoy prom. That Friday, the whole school watched as Elliot approached Vian at lunch with flowers and a giant proposal sign. He executed everything perfectly, just like we'd practiced. Speech, the timing, even the way he held the flowers. Vianne squealed and said yes! While everyone filmed it. The cafeteria erupted in cheers while my heart broke into a million pieces. How could I have let myself fall for a guy who was clear from the start he wanted Vianne? Not me. Elliot's eyes found mine in the crowd for just a second before Vianne pulled him into a hug. I quickly wiped away tears and walked off. I left school early, claiming I felt sick, which was

My mom had me when she was just 13. She was a child herself, but she tried her best. I still remember the day my second grade teacher made us draw our families. Other kids drew stick figures of dads and siblings. I just drew mom. When I got home, Mrs. Peters had written incomplete assignment in red pen across the top. Mom looked at my drawing, then at the red Mark, without a word, she took a marker and drew a giant circle around me and her. This, he said, is a complete family. By middle school, I was a straight a student. Mom would tape my report cards to our fridge like trophies. She'd come home from double shifts at the diner, her uniform stained with grease and still help me with homework. Education is your ticket out, she'd say. Then Cassie Mitchell happened. She cornered me by the lockers surrounded by her friends. Hey, charity case. Is it true your mom was a pregnant middle schooler, but you don't even know who your dad is? They were right. I didn't. The whispers followed me everywhere. Trailer trash, they'd say just loud enough for me to hear. Your mom's a SLT. I started skipping school. When my straight A's turned to F's, school called. Mom took a rare day off from the diner. I expected her to be furious. We couldn't afford lost wages, but When she got home, she just sat beside me on our porch steps, still in her waitress uniform. What's happening, baby? She asked, her voice tired but gentle. I stared at the concrete. Those, it's at school, I finally whispered. They say I'm nothing but a mistake, that I ruined your life. Mom was quiet for so long, I thought she might have fallen asleep. Then she grabbed my shoulders, her eyes suddenly fierce. Listen to me, she said, her voice shaking. Everyone in this town expected me to fail to give you up. My own parents threw me out, but you're the best decision I ever made. She wiped her eyes. So tomorrow we're going to show them exactly what we're made of. The next morning, mom, transform.

After the school shooting at the nearby elementary school, three children were shot dead. One of them was 10 year old Amelia, who bled out in Miss Lee's arms. And two months later, she became my 8th grade history teacher. At first, she seemed normal, just wanted to keep us safe. She locked our door even during class, and memorized every parent's face. When the intercom crackled, she'd freeze for a second before continuing. But as winter turned to spring, Miss Lee's Protection shifted into something scary. In place of our usual classes, we had special safety games where we had to hide in assigned spots around the room as fast as possible. She timed us and said we needed to beat her old class's record. My spot was the coat closet, which felt too small, but Miss Lee swore it was the safest place. The closet saved someone once, she told me. Her eyes looked far away when she said it. The games were kind of fun until Miss Lee started staring at my friend Isabella during them. Isabella had brown hair and freckles, just like the girl in the newspaper photo. Sometimes Miss Lee would call Isabella Amelia, then look confused. I'd constantly hear her whisper, 22 new chances while counting us as more time passed. The more she talked about her old class and how she should have been harder on them. When they laughed during drills, we tried to Tell ourselves it was just part of the process. But I knew none of this was normal when she interrupted class one day to show us her lock screen. It was a photo of her old class. She pointed to each child and told us their names. When she got to Amelia, she started hysterically sobbing. She could barely speak, but even in that state, she made us memorize where Amelia sat and how she hid. Amelia was quiet, I remember her saying, but not quiet enough. From there, I was forced to watch as Miss Lee practically descended into madness. I could tell something terrible was coming. But nothing could have prepared me for that Friday in May. Miss Lee's hands shook so bad she dropped her coffee. She checked her phone constantly and whispered, next time I'll be better. To Amelia's photo. She made us practice hiding six times before 10:00, and her voice sounded strangled whenever she spoke. Today you show me you can survive, she said. Today you prove you're better than my old class. Those were the worst words she had ever said. She unlocked the side door, which was against every school rule. She told us this was our most important drill ever, as she positioned Isabella in the corner, exactly like in the old photos. We had to be perfect or we'd end up in a grave, just like Amelia, she warned us. At 10:00am, the hallway exploded with sound. Gunshots echoed off The walls making my ears ring, Miss Lee screamed.

A parent turned to me and asked, did your ex husband have a beard? I giggled nervously. Um, yeah, why? No, no, no, no, no, she suddenly screamed while walking as far away from me as possible. I just laughed because moms can be so weird sometimes. But the next day, my daughter came home from school crying. Mommy, Leah said her mom said she can't talk to me anymore. Leah was her best friend. I immediately took out my phone and texted her mom asking if everything was okay. No response. I texted Emily's mom, one of the other girls in her trio. Still nothing. I had just managed to calm my baby girl down when the pizza arrived. Usually our delivery guy is the Apache 5,000, but tonight he just set the box on my doorstep and practically ran away. George, you forgot your tip, I yelled, waving a 20. He just kept going. The next few days were insane. At my daughter's soccer practice, Helen saw me walking towards her and held her phone to her ear. No one had even called her. Helen, what's going on? She mouth, sorry and walked faster. We used to complain about our husbands together. Parents were whispering and showing each other something on their phones. When I walked by, they quickly put them away. By Thursday, my daughter was refusing to go to school. I moved my desk away from everyone else. The teacher Said it was for space reasons, but there's like 10 feet between me and Leah now. I tried to bring her to the hairdresser to cheer her up, but when the woman saw me coming, she closed early. No apology. Just flipped the sign and pulled the blinds. My phone buzzed. It was my landlord. Heard what happened. So sorry, rent can wait this month. This was the same man who charged me a 50 dollar inconvenience fee when I paid rent at 12:00am instead of midnight. Then the birthday party, Emily's sleepover. My daughter found out that everyone was invited except her. She was having such a bad panic attack that I had to call a hospital. Mom, what did I do? Emily is my best friend. Enough was enough. I called the school office. Something is happening to my daughter. She's being systematically excluded and I need answers right now. The counselor called back within an hour, but her voice was off, like she was choosing every word carefully. Missus Callahan, we just wanted to check in about your home environment. Is everything safe? Anyone new spending time around your daughter? What? What are you even asking me? I think it's best if we discuss this in person. Can you, you come in tomorrow morning? No. You'll tell me right now why my daughter is being tortured. Long pause. The principal will explain everything tomorrow. Beep. She hung up. Then at eleven PM, an email from my gym. Membership terminated effective immediately. I've been going there for five years. The owner knew me by name. I was trying to figure out what to do when my daughter crawled into my bed at 2:00am sobbing, Mommy, am I ugly? It took everything in me not to burst into tears. The lunch lady wouldn't look at me today. She just pointed at my tray. I finally caved Saturday morning. I found myself walking towards the principal's office while being escorted by a security guard. Other parents there for Saturday sports held their kids against the walls as we passed. One mom literally shielded her son with her body like we were dangerous. In his office, the principal locked the door behind us. The click was so loud in the silence, he walked to the windows and twisted the blinds shut. My daughter grabbed my hand tighter. Please sit down. I'll stand. What is this about? He sat at his desk, fingers hovering over his keyboard, then pulled them back. Mister Griffin, you're scaring me. Missus Callahan, he was looking at his screen, not at me. When did you last speak to your ex husband? Christmas. Why? And you haven't been in contact since then? No communication at all? No. We exchanged texts about.

She returned 6 years later to find I divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years Max. Don't change the locks. He left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation to our 8 year olds. That first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decisions. No more walking on eggshells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curveball in our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year 2 brought unexpected changes without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I'd been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd forgotten how to Enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually, she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her Bonus Mom, their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes and tucked them in at night. Year 5 was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and, and being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year 6, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor role. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward after three Years of zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from the living room. Through the window, we watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck, pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she owned the place.

So I fucked his grandpa. Now, before you call me crazy, stay right there or I'll suck your balls one by one. A simple joke, a meme repeated 1,000 times by fucking kids on the internet. But when he threw it in my face, I felt a crack open inside me, as if behind that laughter there was icy contempt, a refusal to take me seriously. He thought I'd laugh with him, but hell, nah. So I chose to tear away from him what he thought was untouchable, his grandfather. The old man was guilty of nothing except existing in his lineage and having this little bastard with him. His wrinkled skin, his fragile breath, he embodied innocence. And that's precisely what made my act more cruel. I took it, I destroyed it, piece by piece, until only a suffocating silence remained. And then the unthinkable happened. Like a curse born of my actions, his body began to swell, to swell with an alien life. The grandfather, despite his age, now carried within him an impossible pregnancy, an abomination, a cursed child conceived in pain and despair. When his grandson discovered what was happening, his eyes filled with horror. I looked him straight in the eyes and whispered, did you wanna laugh? Look, now your grandfather carries within him the proof of my vengeance. And that laughter will haunt you until your death. That day, he understood that some jokes are worth more than a Smile. They breed monsters.

My brother Jake, has this girlfriend named Becca who literally cannot stand not being the center of attention for 5 minutes. Every family dinner, every holiday, every gathering, she finds a way to make it about her. Last Thanksgiving, she announced she was pregnant right when my dad was about to carve the Turkey. Turns out she wasn't even pregnant. Just wanted to see everyone's reactions. So when I was planning my wedding to my fiance, Ryan, I knew I had to do something about the Becca situation. This was going to be my one day, the one day that was supposed to be about me and Ryan starting our life together. I called Jake about three months before the wedding. Hey, so about the wedding, I started. I need to ask you something kind of awkward. What's up, he said. And I could hear him eating cereal in the background. I, I really don't want Becca there. I know that sounds harsh, but she always makes everything about herself and I just can't deal with that stress on my wedding day. The line went quiet for like 10 seconds and Jake exploded. Are you serious right now you're uninviting my girlfriend from your wedding? I'm not uninviting her because she was never invited in the first place. The invitation was just for you. That's the same thing. We've been together for two years. She's basically family. I. Tried to explain that it wasn't personal, that I just wanted one drama free day. But Jake wasn't having it. He said if Becca couldn't come, then he wouldn't come either. I told him that was his choice. Hope think he changed his mind? He didn't. But here's where it gets crazy. The day of my wedding, I'm getting my makeup done in the bridal suite when my cousin Madison bursts in. Uh, you need to see this, he says, shoving her phone in my face. It's Becca's Instagram story. She's posted like 15 videos of herself getting all dressed up, doing her makeup, picking out jewelry. The caption on the last one says, can't wait to celebrate love today with a bunch of heart emojis and the location tagged as our wedding venue. My heart drops. He's coming anyway. Madison nods. Jake's outside right now arguing with your dad about it. He says he changed his mind and decided to bring her. I'm standing there in my wedding dress, half my makeup done and I have to deal with.

My brother Ryan was marrying this absolute nightmare of a woman named Brianna. Nobody in our family could stand her, but Ryan was completely blind to it. She was controlling from day one. She told my mom she couldn't wear navy to the wedding because that was her colour. She demanded our family pay for all the flowers, which cost like $3,000. I asked if I could bring my two kids to the wedding. She said absolutely not because children would ruin her perfect day. But the worst part was when we found out she hadn't even sent an invitation to our grandma Helen. When my mom asked why, Brianna just shrugged and said grandma was boring and would probably fall asleep during the ceremony anyway. I was furious. Grandma Helen was 82 and had basically raised Ryan after our dad died. She taught him how to drive, helped him with homework every night, and even paid for his college textbooks when money was tight. When grandma found out she wasn't invited, she didn't yell or cry like I expected. She just sat quietly in her kitchen chair, nodding slowly. Then she looked up at me with this calm smile and said, well, we'll see about that, won't we? The wedding day came and I was dreading every minute of it. The venue was actually this gorgeous old mansion that had been in our family for decades. Grandma had let Ryan use it for free because she wanted his wedding to be special. I was standing there watching Brianna boss around the photographers when suddenly I heard gasps from the guests. There was Grandma Helen walking up the main entrance in the most stunning gold gown I'd ever seen. She looks like royalty. She was carrying this leather folder under her arm and had the biggest smile on her face. Brianna spotted her immediately and marched over, her face turning bright red. What are you doing here? You weren't invited, Brianna screamed loud enough for everyone to hear. The entire wedding party stopped what they were doing to watch. Grandma didn't even.

Allison couldn't let anyone else have their moment. At our cousin Jamie's beach wedding, she grabbed the mic during toasts to announce her divorce. During our cousin Alex's first dance, she loudly told everyone at our table she was pregnant. At my best friend's reception, she stood on a chair during the cutting to reveal she was moving to Paris. That moment of chaos at her reception was nothing compared to what awaited me three months later at my wedding. Everything was going perfectly until the speeches started. My maid of honor was halfway through her beautiful toast when Allison stood up. She clinked her glass dramatically and walked to the front. She took the microphone right out of my friend's hand. Sorry, but I have something important to share while everyone's here, she announced. She pulled her boyfriend, Craig, up beside her. She told the entire room they were adopting a baby from Korea. My guests erupted in confused congratulations while my maid of honor stood there holding her speech cards uselessly. The rest of my reception became the Allison show. People kept coming up to her for details about the adoption. Someone started a collection for baby supplies using the envelope box meant for our cards. The photographer spent 20 minutes doing an impromptu photo shoot of her and Craig. My mom found me crying in the bathroom and told me I was being dramatic. She's just excited about becoming a mother, she said. You should be happy for family. My aunt agreed that Allison was just enthusiastic about sharing good news. A few months later, at Sunday dinner, Allison announced her wedding date. She went on and on about her vintage Hollywood glamour theme. She'd already booked the historic Grandview Manor downtown. Frank sat there nodding while she showed everyone her Pinterest boards. I want it to be absolutely perfect, she gushed. No interruptions or distractions. Just all eyes on us for once. The irony nearly choked me, but I smiled and said it sounded lovely. That night, I started planning. Allison's fatal flaw was her complete blindness to her own behavior. She genuinely believed she was just sharing joy. She couldn't understand why anyone would mind. She also had zero ability to handle competition for attention. I reached out to my college theater friends first. My roommate Macy ran an improv group that specialized in flash mobs and public performances. When I explained my idea, she literally cackled with delight. Within a week, I had 12 performers committed to the cause. The tricky part was getting them into the wedding. I studied Allison's guest list when she left it at my mom's house. Several couples had generic plus one RSVPs. Macy's performers could pose as dates for single guests. I knew. I reached out to these friends and explained the situation. Every single one wanted to help. After hearing About my wedding the wedding was as over the top as expected. Allison had seven bridesmaids and released doves during the ceremony. The reception ballroom dripped with crystals and white roses. My performers were scattered perfectly throughout the room as planned. Guests everything started during dinner service. At exactly 6:30, Macy stood up at table 4 and let out a shriek. Her fake boyfriend was on one knee between the salad and soup courses. The whole room turned to watch as she said yes. He slipped a costume jewelry ring on her finger. Allison's smile froze, but she started clapping along with everyone else. At 6:45 during the champagne toast.

For as long as I could remember, my younger brother Garrett had been insecure about being weak and scrawny. The LaCrosse team would shove him into lockers daily, calling him twig boy. The worst was when he couldn't open a water bottle at lunch and his crush Emily laughed, asking the guy next to her, Garrett's too weak. He needs a man to help him. I always felt bad for him. But the day he discovered one punch man, everything changed. He burst into my room holding his phone, showing me Saitama's transformation. Look, he was just like me. A weak, bullied nobody. Then he did the simple training and became the strongest hero alive. I was just happy he found something that gave him hope. The very next morning, Garrett started Saitama's routine religiously. 100 push UPS, 100 sit UPS, 100 squats, a 10 kilometer run every single day. Within two months, his arms showed actual definition and his chest filled out his shirts. The LaCrosse team stopped shoving him around completely, while mom bought him protein powder and dad installed a pull up bar. Look at my dedicated boy, she'd beam at dinner. When he shaved his head bald, the school counselor pulled me aside. Whatever is motivating him, it's working. His grades are up, confidence through the roof. Even I was impressed when he bench pressed his body. Wait. For the first time. The best part was Emily Starting to notice watching him do pull UPS after school and asking about his anime workout, he'd flex and quote, Sidima, I'm just a guy who's a hero for fun. We all laughed because he was finally becoming the person he wanted to be. But as months passed, things shifted when Garrett demanded everyone call him Sidima. Refusing to respond to Garrett anymore, teachers got email signed Sidima, while he begged mom to legally change his name. When you're 18, she said, this is just a phase. Soon after, he quit soccer. Because Sidima trained alone, and his knuckles stayed permanently stabbed. From concrete walls in our basement. I'm removing my limiters, he explained, wrapping them in bloody gauze. Now deadlifting 300 pounds, his frame had exploded from 130 to 200 pounds of pure muscle, with veins sneaking up his arms like cables. When I tried talking to him about my concerns, he brushed me off. You're getting too intense about this whole point is to push past human limits. He showed me his training journal, filled with detailed power rankings, strength measurements, and notes about breaking through, with page after page of sidemen quotes highlighted in yellow. After he passed out doing squats, mom attempted an intervention. Honey, you need rest days. Tama never rested. That's why he transcended. He stormed out to run his 10 kilometer run at midnight. Then the mall incident started a week later, when he began picking fights, asking random guys to test his Power level until security banned him after the third confrontation. His fist now bore a tattoo reading one punch in bold letters across the knuckles. Six months into his transformation, Garrett looked like a bodybuilder who'd swallowed another bodybuilder. At 220 pounds of carved muscle with shoulders so wide he turned sideways through doorways. We were driving to get groceries on a normal Tuesday morning when he saw a cop conducting a routine traffic stop on the shoulder. Pull over, he said with deadly calm in his voice. What? No, we need to pull over. He grabbed the wheel. This is it, my moment. I pulled over with shaking hands as he got out and walked toward the officer with purpose. The cop immediately tensed with his hand moving to his whole

In my family, we had something called Health Day. Every Saturday morning at 9:00am sharp, we'd finish breakfast and dad would already have the basement ready with his white coat on and all his medical equipment laid out on metal trays in the basement. Our mom would kiss our foreheads before sending us down one by one. Then came the examinations. Thorough inspections of every inch of our bodies while he muttered medical terms and scribbled in thick blue binders. He'd make us stand naked under the bright lights while he circled us slow, his gloved fingers pressing into our skin, checking what he called abnormalities. He called it preventative care. I dreaded it. Every single week. The rule was you couldn't flinch or complain or you'd start over from the beginning. The strangest part? We weren't allowed to mention health day at school. Not to teachers, not to friends. I only realised in middle school how weird that was. How other kids just went to pediatricians once a year, not secret basement clinics every week. But the worst part was the special examinations. If dad found something concerning during the regular check, you'd get called down. On week nights, he had this small locked room with bright lights and an exam table with stirrups. The metal was always cold and he'd spend what felt like hours with his instruments, documenting every detail while telling us to relax and breathe. He said it Was for comprehensive assessment. The kid. I was terrified. I'd count the ceiling tiles over and over. But dad said fear meant you were taking your health seriously. When I got older, I started questioning everything. Why did we need weekly exams when no one else did? Why did mom drink before every health day? I remember once, at 14, I asked if I could skip it for Rachel's sleepover. Dad gripped my wrist and stared at me with these desperate eyes. Health Day is the only thing keeping you safe, he said. That's when I knew something was deeply wrong. Rachel's family had annual checkups, vaccinations, schedules, growth charts on the fridge. No basement procedures, no locked rooms, no binders documenting their bodies. Just normal healthcare. I finally refused to go downstairs when I turned 16. Dad went ballistic, screaming that I was ungrateful and didn't understand the dangers. Mom just stood there shaking. He locked me in my room and said I couldn't leave until I submitted to a full examination the next morning. Mom slipped me $20 under the door and whispered to use the window. When I came back that night, dad acted like nothing had happened. He just asked if I was ready for my examination, like he hadn't imprisoned me the night before. That's when I started planning. Still, the whole thing ate at me. Why was dad so obsessed with our health when he wasn't even a doctor? Where did he get all That equipment. Three months later, I told my health teacher everything. Missus Patterson kept her face very still as I explained our Saturday routine. She said she needed to make a phone call. I knew what that meant. She came back with the principal. Then the police came. Then child services. They took us out of class one by one. Just like health day. Except this time, we didn't go home. I'll never forget Dad's face when they arrested him.

When she said I didn't understand her loss. My sister in law Kelly had her first miscarriage about six months ago. It was devastating. I get that. The whole family rallied around her and my brother Jake, bringing casseroles and giving them space to grieve. But then she started acting like she was the only person who'd ever lost a baby. Started small at family dinners, she'd make comments about how nobody understood what real loss felt like. When my cousin Amanda talked about her dog dying, Kelly rolled her eyes and said that's not the same thing at all. When my mom mentioned missing my grandpa who died last year, Kelly literally scoffed and said, you got to say goodbye to him. Though the worst part was how she treated me. I've been married to my husband Chris for eight years and we don't have kids yet. Kelly started making these passive aggressive comments about how lucky I was to not have to worry about these things, how I couldn't possibly understand what she was going through. Last weekend was my nephew's birthday party. Kelly seemed okay during most of it, playing with the kids and laughing at their jokes. But then my brother's friend brought up how his wife was pregnant and Kelly's whole mood shifted. She got quiet and started picking out her food. Later when we were in the kitchen cleaning up, Kelly started talking about how Hard it was seeing pregnant women everywhere. I tried to be supportive, telling her I understood how triggering that must be. That's when she snapped. No, you don't understand, she said, her voice getting louder. You have no idea what it's like to lose a baby. You've never even been pregnant. You don't know what real loss feels like. Something inside me just broke. I've been holding this in for years, keeping it private because Chris and I decided we didn't want the.

I hated the idea of my 17 year old daughter dating anyone. But when she brought home this boy named Pete, I lost it. He had a motorcycle, tattoos, and that smug smile that made me want to run his name through the system. I made it my mission to break them up. I'd randomly show up at places they hung out, flash my badge around, and remind Pete that I knew how to make bodies disappear. But this kid never flinched. He just smile and say, have a good day, sir. When he came for dinner the first time, I placed my gun on the table next to my plate. My wife kicked me under the table, but I didn't care. Pete just looked at it and said, nice Glock 19, sir. My uncle's got the same one at his security firm. That's when the real torture began. I started making him come over every weekend to bond. I'd have him help me with the most backbreaking chores I could think of. Reshingling the roof in July, digging out a tree stump by hand, moving every piece of furniture in the house to steam clean the carpets. This kid never complained. He'd show up at 7:00am sharp, already wearing work clothes. Even brought his own work gloves. When I try to wear him down with endless tasks, he just say, what's next, Sir, one Saturday I had him helping me rebuild the deck. I was being extra harsh, making him redo boards that were perfectly fine. Around noon, my daughter brought us water. As she walked away, I caught Pete watching her. But it wasn't the way most teenage boys looked at girls. He had this soft smile, like he was watching something precious. I decided to test him. You know she's way out of your league, right? He wiped his forehead and said, oh, I know, sir. Trust me, I know. That's why I'm here every weekend, letting you test me. Cause she's worth it. I was about to respond when we heard screaming from inside the house. We both ran in to find my wife on the kitchen floor. She'd

I used to work as a prison guard and one day our warden decided it would be a good idea to bring his 10 year old daughter in so she could see where dad works. He left her alone in his office for just a minute. When she wandered out, he found her 10 minutes later in one of the corridors bleeding out from her head with the fly on her pants undone. Watching him clutch her against his chest and hold her lifeless body repeating daddy's got you, sweetheart for hours was a sight I'll never forget. From that moment on, he became obsessed with finding out who did this. He didn't even take a day off from work, just came in next morning off, no sleep, spent the whole day grilling every prisoner in guard. He offered bribes, reduce sentences, special privileges, anything for information. I remember watching him break down between interviews then slam his head into the wall repeatedly just so the physical pain could momentarily drown out the emotional one for long enough to conduct the next interview. He grounded everybody he thought gave suspicious answers and threatened them with solitary confinement, beatings, firings for guards. He even went as far as forcing a prisoner to wear a wire during yard to hopefully catch an admission, threatening that prisoner with an extra two years to his sentence if he didn't wear it. Unfortunately, his interviews didn't get him an Answer, so he started becoming more harsh. Two and a half weeks after the death, he came into work hammered and grabbed me by the shoulders, telling me today was the beginning of the end. He then rounded up all the prisoners and announced to them that until the truth about who did it comes out, they would only be getting fed every second day. The backlash was brutal and the warden took that as a sign that the people protesting were guilty, got a hold of everyone who stepped out of line and ordered us, the guards, to beat them. Some guards, including myself, felt bad and didn't want to. But he threatened our jobs, saying if we're hesitating, then that means one of us must have called his daughter. He'd pace her.

How has it gone for you? When my wife Rachel and I adopted Devon at six years old, they told us she had mild trust issues. What they didn't tell us was that she'd been returned by three families already. Devon showed up at our house with one tiny suitcase and a backpack that first night. I watched her through the doorway as she carefully laid out all her clothes on the bed. She folded each piece perfectly, put it back in the suitcase, and zipped it up. Then she slept on top of the covers, fully dressed. I thought maybe she was just nervous, but weeks went by, and that suitcase never got unpacked. She'd take out one outfit each morning, wear it all day, then fold it back up at night. Her closet stayed completely empty. Rachel tried everything. New sheets with unicorns on them, a night light shaped like a butterfly. We even let her pick out paint for her room walls. She chose white. Just plain white like before. One morning, I found her in the kitchen at 5 a m. Making her own breakfast. Toast with no butter, just dry bread. When I asked why she was up so early, she said, I didn't want to bother you guys. Sometimes people get mad when kids wake them up. That broke my heart. Rachel and I had been trying for years to have kids. We dreamed About Saturday morning pancakes and bedtime stories. But Devin acted like she was living in a hotel, not a home. The real wake up call came three months later. I got home from work and heard crying upstairs. Found Devin sitting on her bed, holding that stupid suitcase in her lap. What's wrong, sweetheart? She looked up at me with these huge brown eyes and said, I heard you and Rachel fighting last night about money. I know kids cost a lot. I can go back to Miss Janet tomorrow if you want. Miss Janet was her social worker. My throat got tight. Rachel and I had been arguing about our car payment. Nothing to do with Devon at all. Devon, we weren't fighting about you. We love having you here. She just shrugged. That's what the Johnson said, too. And the Millers. They all said I was special. Until I wasn't anymore. That night, Rachel and I sat up talking until 3 a m. We realized Devon wasn't just scared of us leaving her. She was waiting for us to leave her. She'd been through this routine before. Nice family, happy faces. Then back to foster care. When things got tough the next day, I had an idea. I went to the hardware store and bought the biggest picture frame they had, like three feet wide. Then Rachel and I spent the whole weekend taking photos. Devon at breakfast, Devon watching TV, Devon playing with our dog Charlie. Just Normal, boring family stuff. We printed out all the pictures and arranged them in the frame. Beach trips we took her on. Movie nights on the couch. Devon's first day at her new school. Even the bad pictures where someone was making a weird face. When Devon got home from school Monday, we called her into the living room.

My parents were so worried about me dating a skater boy. They couldn't imagine he'd be the reason I'm still alive today. A few nights ago, my parents found out about my skater boyfriend, Gregus, when his message popped up on my screen at dinner. I love you, too. Who the heck are you talking to? My mom shouted, glaring the screen of my phone. You're 14. No dating until you're 30. We were very clear. Dad pulled up Gregus's Instagram on his own phone. A skateboarder? Really? This is who you're risking your future for? I tried to reason with them, but they refused to listen and forced me to block him everywhere, right there, over dinner. You'll thank us when you're in college, mom said while I sobbed. My friends tried passing messages between us at school, but my parents found out and threatened to call their parents. Eventually, everyone gave up, except for Gregus. Gregus showed up mysteriously in my valorant. Hey, Mel. It's been a while, he said, his voice breaking. I miss you, Mel. I know we're not supposed to talk, but let's at least play like we used to. We started meeting in the lobbies every day after that, just playing and chatting about normal things. School friends, my strict parents. He never once tried to convince me to sneak around or meet up in person. He never complained about my Parents or tried to turn me against them. When I vent about how unfair they were being, he'd actually defend them. Sometimes they're just scared, Once my older sister got mixed up with some bad people in high school. Parents get paranoid. He still cared about me in all the ways that mattered. When I failed my chemistry test because I couldn't focus, he spent three hours teaching me balancing equations over discord. When my grandmother got sick, he stayed up until 3:00am just listening to me cry. You can always reach me here, he promised. I don't care what time it is. Mom almost got us once when she walked by while discord was open. I clicked to my game lobby just in time. Homework break? She asked. I nodded and switched back to my essay, my heart pounding so hard I thought she'd hear it after she left Greg's message. Maybe we should stop. I don't want to get you in trouble. But I couldn't lose him again. He was the only person who I could rely on. And thank god I didn't lose him, because a couple of days later, my friend Sarah and I got caught up in some shady business. It was supposed to be a normal Saturday night sleepover. Her parents went out for their anniversary, leaving us to watch movies and eat junk food. I was on the phone messaging Gregus on discord when Sarah's older brother Joshua came home from College, completely wasted with two other friends, Sarah immediately tensed up. baby sis and baby girl, he winked. Disgusting. He and his friends sat beside us on the sofa, placing his arm over my shoulder, constantly whispering things like, I know you're not as innocent as you act, and your parents don't have to know. I pushed his face away and stood up, glaring. Can you stop? Sarah was almost crying, begging me not to make him mad. He gets mean when he's drunk. She was just ignore him and he'll pass out soon. But when Joshua grabbed my waist and tried to pull me onto his lap, I grabbed Sarah's arm and ran to the bathroom, quickly locking the door. He started pounding on it, laughing with his friends about how I was playing hard to get and needed to loosen up. Sarah hopped into the tub, hugging her knees to her chest. I. I patted my pockets, realizing I had left my phone in the living room. Soon the knocks on the door became angrier. Hitting the door harder, jiggling the handle aggressively, Sarah meekly handed me her phone.

My boyfriend brought his new coworker Dave, to our housewarming party last weekend. I have a 13 year old beagle named Murphy who's blind in one eye from an accident years ago and moves pretty slowly these days. He's the sweetest old guy, never bothers anyone, just likes to find a cozy spot and watch the world go by. I'd invited about 20 people over to show off our new place. Everyone was having a great time, music playing, people mingling between the kitchen and living room. Murphy had claimed his usual spot by the fireplace, occasionally getting gentle pets from guests who thought he was adorable. About an hour into the party, I realized I hadn't seen Murphy in a while. That's unusual because he never wanders far from wherever the action is. Started looking around, calling his name softly so I wouldn't alarm anyone. Finally found him locked in the laundry room, whimpering and scratching at the door. The moment I opened it, he practically collapsed into my arms, shaking. When I helped him stand, he was limping badly on his back right leg. My heart immediately started racing. Murphy's old and fragile. Any injury could be serious. I carried him back to the living room and asked everyone what happened, trying to keep my voice calm but probably failing. Most of my guests looked genuinely concerned and confused. A few people mentioned seeing him Earlier, but nothing seemed wrong. That's when Dave, who'd been standing by the beer cooler looking completely unbothered, started laughing. Oh yeah, that old dog kept get getting in my way while I was grabbing another beer, he said casually like he was talking about the weather. Kept bumping into my legs. So I gave him a little kick to move him along. No big deal. The entire room went silent. I stared at him in complete shock, not sure I'd heard correctly. You kicked my 13 year old blind dog, I asked. My voice probably getting louder than I intended. Dave just shrugged with this annoying smirk, barely touched him. He's fine. Obviously dogs need to learn boundaries anyway. Can't just let them walk all over you. My boyfriend's face went completely pale and he immediately started apologizing, clearly mortified. But I was already seeing red. Murphy was now hiding behind my legs, trembling and refusing to put weight on his injured paw. Everyone needs to leave right now, I announced to the room. Everyone except you. I pointed directly at Dave. You're staying to explain this to someone special. My guests filed out quickly, many of them shooting disgusted looks at Dave and offering to help with Murphy. My boyfriend hesitated, but I told him he needed to leave too and think about the kind and of people he brings around. Once the house cleared, I called my neighbor Jim. He's a retired police officer who absolutely adores Murphy and has a spare key to check on him when I travel for work. Jim treats Murphy like his own grand dog. Jim arrived within five minutes, still in his weak.

Now my, he wants my house. When I was 16, my gaming obsessed brother Tyler convinced my parents I was taking up too much space in our cramped three bedroom apartment. He'd been complaining for months that he needed my room for his elaborate gaming setup. My parents sat me down one evening and basically said I had two weeks to find alternative living arrangements. The reasoning, I was almost 17, practically an adult and Tyler needed space to pursue his passion in gaming and they genuinely believed he was going to become the next big twitch star. I was devastated but had nowhere to go. My girlfriend Emma's parents noticed I'd been spending more time at their house and eventually asked what was going on. When I explained the situation, her mom immediately said I could stay stay with them as long as I needed, no questions asked. Emma and I got serious fast. Living under the same roof will do that to a relationship. When we turned 19, I proposed with a ring. I'd saved six months for working overtime every weekend. Parents were thrilled. They basically raised me for two years anyway and considered me their son. At 23, we finally had enough saved for a down payment on a small two bedroom house, nothing fancy. We spent every weekend renovating, learning YouTube tutorials, making mistakes and fixing them. Meanwhile, Tyler was still living with my parents in his gaming paradise. He Dropped out of community college after one semester, claiming his streaming career was about to take off. College was just holding him back. Three years later, he was still grinding away at maybe five viewers on a good day, sleeping until two PM, gaming until 4:00am, ordering Doordash with my parents money. My parents occasionally texted generic holiday messages or shared Facebook posts about family, but otherwise, we had zero relationship. Last month, my mom showed up at my house completely unannounced. I hadn't seen her.

Maya was the kind of teacher who got off on making students miserable. In AP history, he'd lean over your desk during tests, breathing coffee breath down your neck while tapping his pen on your paper, just to throw you off. And when he handed back essays drowned in red ink, he'd always had his favourite line in the real world, this wouldn't fly. I spent all junior year counting down to summer, marking days off my calendar like a prisoner, thinking I'd finally be free of his polyester blazers and power trips. So when I walked into the driver's ed two weeks later and saw him sitting behind the instructor's desk, my stomach dropped like a stone. Where do I turn? I asked during our first lesson, gripping the wheel nervously. You don't turn unless I say to, he barked, making me swerve slightly. Just assume you're going straight until I say otherwise. Though with your steering, straight is a pretty loose term. The two other girls in the backseat exchanged looks through the rearview mirror. When Sophia gripped the wheel too tight, he chuckled. Death grip won't help you drive better, sweetheart. This isn't a strength test. Emily stalled at a stop sign and he slapped his knee, laughing. And this is why I keep my seatbelt extra tight with you girls. Never know when We're gonna stop or if we're gonna stop. By the third lesson, we discovered his pattern. He'd make his nasty jokes for 20 minutes, then use the afternoon drives as nap time while we practiced highway driving. Don't worry about that curb you just kissed, said when I beard slightly. I'm sure it'll recover from the trauma. Unlike my neck. When Sophia asked about parallel parking, he laughed. You can barely handle forward parking and you wanna try parallel? That's adorable. He spent the entire next lesson bragging about his important dinner plans with his wife. If we survive today's lesson, that is three teenage girls driving. I should update my will. One afternoon, Sophia slightly veered and he exploded. Jesus, are you trying to collect mailboxes? Cause you're doing great. He wiped tears from laughing so hard. You know, girls like you three are why insurance rates are so high. And why driving instructors need hazard pay. It's funny because it's true. Then he made his final comparison. My five year old nephew has better control of his big wheel than you girls have of this car. He was still chuckling when he added, just try not to kill us while I. And then he was snoring, head tilted back against the headrest. I looked at Emily and Sophia in the rearview mirror and something passed between us. That's when I realised he told me to never turn unless he said so. The interstate entrance was coming up on The right, and I could see the big green sign marking I ninety five north hanging over the highway like a dare. I tilted my head slightly toward it and Emily caught my glance, following my eyes to the sign before whispering, I didn't hear him say turn, while Sophia nodded slowly and added me neither. I glanced down at the fuel gauge showing a full tank. Back at the sleeping Mister Maya, and as we approached the on ramp and I felt the car naturally wanting to continue straight onto the interstate, I took a deep breath and tightened my grip on the wheel. Well, he did say to follow his instructions exactly. The merge onto the interstate was smooth, and Mister Maya kept snoring while the highway stretched endlessly ahead. 30 minutes passed, then an hour, and his phone started buzzing in the cup holder with increasing frequency. We passed the welcome to New Jersey sign after two hours, making Emily stifle a nervous giggle as his phone lit up.

My neighbor, Mrs. Daniels, called 9 1 1 like it was her personal hotline. Monday, she reported my kids for trespassing because their ball went in her yard. Wednesday, she called the cops because my autistic son was making noise in our own backyard. Friday, she called saying the kids were in danger because they were playing tag. The 9 1 1 operator probably recognized her voice better than her own family did. Things got worse as spring turned into summer and her calls went from annoying to actually dangerous. First, she called CPS and said we left our kids alone outside. I was sitting right there on the porch with a book when the social worker showed up. They close the case right away, but people had already started talking about us. Two weeks later, during my daughter's birthday party, she called the fire department about a gas leak. Five fire trucks showed up with their sirens going and scared all 12 kids at the party. The firefighters didn't find anything, but she went on Facebook saying we were probably making drugs. The worst thing happened in July when my autistic son had a meltdown in our yard. She called 9 1 1 and said a child was being beaten. The cop showed up ready for a domestic violence call and found me hugging my upset kid. Officer Martinez said something about her false Reports but nothing happened to her. She started calling during my work zoom meetings on purpose. Other neighbors told me she kept notebooks full of made up complaints with dates and everything. She actually brag to people about making families like ours want to move away. Everything went crazy on a Tuesday in August when I got a letter from her lawyer wanting $15,000. She said we cause her emotional distress even though she was the one who called 9 1 1 53 times. I tried to talk to her like a normal person, but she said she'd add harassment to the lawsuit. That same day, my autistic son had his first friend from therapy come over to play. While the two kids were quietly playing with Legos, she called about suspicious people in my yard. Police cars surrounded my house and both seven year olds were terrified.

My boyfriend, Jake, had been the same couch potato for three years. The guy who needed me to open pickle jars was suddenly doing push UPS at 6:00am. When I asked what sparked this change, he just shrugged and said he wanted to get healthy, but something felt wrong. It started small. He bought protein powder and left it on the kitchen counter like some kind of trophy. Then he got a gym membership to this fancy place across town instead of the Planet Fitness two blocks away. When I suggested we work out together, he got weird and said he preferred going alone to focus. Red flags kept piling up. He started showering immediately after coming home from the gym, which seemed normal until I realised he never smelled like sweat. His gym clothes were always perfectly clean, too. One day I decided to surprise him with lunch at his gym. The guy at the front desk looked confused when I asked for Jake. Turns out he hadn't been there in weeks. I confronted him that night. He got defensive and said he switched gyms because the other one was too crowded. When I asked which gym, he stuttered and said some random name I'd never heard of. That's when I knew he was lying. So I did what any suspicious girlfriend would do. I followed him the next Tuesday. I Watched him drive past three different gyms and pull into the parking lot of a Starbucks. Through the window, I saw him sitting across from this blonde girl who definitely wasn't just a workout buddy. She was laughing at everything he said and touching his arm constantly. My heart was pounding as I watched them for 20 minutes. When she got up to leave, he grabbed her hand and kissed it. I wanted to storm in there and cause a scene, but instead I waited. He came home an hour later with this fake exhausted look, complaining about how intense his workout was. I played along for two more weeks watching him lie to my face every single day. He even started buying workout supplements and leaving them around the apartment as props. Worst part was when he'd flex his non existent new muscles and ask if I noticed any changes. Then I got clever. I told him my friend Emma was looking for a new gym and asked for his recommendation. He panicked and said his gym was full and not taking new members. When I offered to call and check, he quickly said they had a waiting list and it wouldn't be worth it. That weekend, Jake said he was going to a special Saturday morning workout class. Instead, I followed him to the same Starbucks. This time they were holding hands across the table and looking at something on her phone together when he leaned over and Kissed her forehead. I knew I had enough evidence, but I didn't confront him yet. I had a better plan. I went home and researched the girl on social media, found her Instagram through the Starbucks location tag. Her name was Ashley. And according to her posts, she'd been seeing someone new for the past month. The timeline matched perfectly with Jake's sudden fitness obsession. Monday night, I casually mentioned that I'd signed up for a trial at his gym and would love to work out together.

My little sister demanded I teach my study partner how to braid hair because she was convinced we were secretly in love. Emily was eight and had this weird obsession with my chemistry study partner, Conrad. Every Tuesday and Thursday when he'd come over, she'd magically appear with some urgent eight year old business. Can I show you my rock collection? Do you wanna see me do a cartwheel? Did you know I lost a tooth yesterday? Conrad was incredibly patient with her, always stopping whatever we were doing to admire her latest drawing or listen to her explain why unicorns were scientifically possible. I kept apologizing, but he just laugh and say she reminded him of his little cousins back home. He actually seemed to enjoy her interruptions, which made me like him even more. One Thursday, Emily cornered me in the kitchen while Conrad was in the bathroom. You need to teach Conrad how to braid hair, she whispered urgently. Why would I do that, M? Because when you guys get married and have daughters, he'll need to know how to do their hair for school. It's basic dad requirements. I nearly choked on my water. We're not getting married. We're just study partners. She rolled her eyes. He looks at you funny when you're working on equations. Like how dad looks at mom when she's making pancakes. Trust me, I'm very observant about Romance things. The next week, she orchestrated her master plan. Right before Conrad arrived, she accidentally left her favorite doll, Bella, in the living room, hair completely tangled. When Conrad walked in, Emily gasped dramatically, oh, no!

She returned 6 years later to find I'd divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years, Max. Don't change the locks. He left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation. To our eight year olds, that first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home, and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decisions. No more walking on eggshells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. Taught Walter to throw a curveball in our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year two brought unexpected changes. Without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I'd been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd forgotten how to enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually, she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her bonus mom. Their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes, and tucked them in at night. Year five was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and be being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year six, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward. After three years of zero Contact court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from in the living room. Through the window, we watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she owned the place. Eleanor was packing the twins lunches for

My wife Stephanie waited until we were eating dessert at Cassie and Paul's house to drop this on me. We should swap partners every Thursday, she said, and I literally watched her put her hand on Paul's thigh under the table. I saw it. Cassie saw it, too, and her face went blank. What? I asked, because I honestly thought I heard her wrong. Partner swapping. We date each other's spouses. She said it like she was talking about switching cars for the weekend. Paul kept staring at his plate and wouldn't make eye contact with me. It's already decided, Stephanie said. Thursday nights, you take Cassie out, Paul takes me. I felt my chest get tight. When did they decide this without me? This is insane, I told her. Then she leaned in close and whispered, room 2:37 last Tuesday when you were at work. My whole body went numb. She was telling me she'd already cheated and now wanted my permission to keep doing it. So are you in or not? She asked louder. I looked at Cassie, and she was crying without making any sound. Fine, I said. Let's swap partners. Stephanie smiled like she just won something. But then I noticed Cassie had stopped crying completely. Should have told me something right there. When the first date night came around, Stephanie spent forever getting ready. She put on this red Dress I've never seen before. That she'd been hiding in our closet. Paul's car was already running in our driveway when I left. I brought Cassie white roses because I remembered she mentioned liking them once. Her hands shook when she took them. Paul? Never. She started, then stopped. At dinner, she pushed her food around and barely ate anything. You okay? I asked. Paul's been different, she said quietly. For months, even before. Then she stopped talking again. I reached over and touched her hand. Before what? Nothing. Forget I said anything. But then her phone lit up with Stephanie's name, and she turned it face down immediately. When I got home that night, Stephanie was already there. Her hair was all messed up and her lipstick was smeared on the wrong side of her mouth. How was Cassie? Good. How was Paul? Then she started telling me everything they did. The hotel room, the balcony, what they did against the wall. She kept getting louder with each detail. Stop, I told her. Why? Don't you want to know? No. Her face got all twisted up. Well, I'm telling you anyway. She kept going with more details while I pulled out my phone and texted Cassie, thank you for a lovely evening. Stephanie saw my screen and threw her wine glass at the wall. It shattered everywhere, and I just stood there looking at her. The next week, I had to pick Cassie up because her car broke down. Out of nowhere. Paul was supposed to drive me, she said, looking confused. I forgot at dinner. She had way too much wine. Can I tell you something? She asked, and her eyes looked glassy. Tuesday afternoons. That's when it started. My heart started racing. What started? She covered her mouth with her hand. Nothing. Forget it. But Tuesday was when Stephanie had mentioned the hotel and we both knew what she meant. Then we had to go to Stephanie's parents house for dinner. Stephanie showed up late and I could smell Paul's Cologne all over her clothes. Her mom noticed it right away and her face changed. Is that men's Cologne? The whole table went quiet. We're sharing partners with Cassie and Paul, I said. Every week. Her dad dropped his fork and it made this loud sound. Sharing? Taking turns dating each other's spouses. Stephanie's idea. Her mom stood up from the table in my house, she said, and her voice was shaking. Stephanie tried to explain, but everyone had already smelled the Cologne and knew what was happening. That night Cassie called me. I know about Tuesday afternoons. I felt sick to my stomach about them. I followed Paul once four months ago to the hotel. She sounded drunk. I saw everything. By week five, everything fell apart. It was Cassie's birthday and I threw her a surprise party. I made a video of all her artwork and gave the speech about how talented and kind she Was. I forgot it was her birthday completely. I watched Stephanie watch Cassie cry happy tears and hold on to me like she didn't want to let go. That night, Stephanie came home from Paul's and started telling me what they did in graphic detail again. Stop. I don't want to hear it. She got mad. But I'm telling you everything. I didn't ask. Then she demanded to know what Cassie and I did together.

I volunteered without thinking. I'll watch them, I said, heart racing from how close she was to me. Are you serious? It's three kids. Three for at least two weeks. I waved my hand around like a lovesick fool. How hard can it be? The kids showed up at my apartment that night with tons of suitcases. The oldest, around 14, looked at her mom and said, really? Another boyfriend? Cher's face went red. He's just a friend from work, Camilla. The middle one, 10, rolled his eyes. The youngest, Kevin, wouldn't even look at me. They stood in my doorway like they were being sentenced to prison. Cher hugged them quickly, told them to be good, and left for the airport. I stood there with three kids who clearly hated me and realized I was in way over my head. The first morning, I woke up early to make them pancakes. When the oldest one, Camilla, laughed. She's not here, you know. You can stop trying, she said. Besides, You're not her type. Mom doesn't date guys without kids. We seen this a dozen times already. It hurt, but it wasn't a lie. Shares, co workers, guys from her gym, men from dating apps. Everyone wanted to play dad until they realized three kids meant actual work. And the kids really didn't make it any easier. From spilling drinks on my laptop to turning the TV up during important zoom meetings, they hated every second with me. Dude, just survive until she gets back, then ask her out. My friend told me that became the plan. Survive two weeks, do whatever to keep the kids happy. Be the hero, finally land a date with share. But like most things, it doesn't always happen the way you want it to. Sometime within the second week, the middle kid, Murph, came home from school trying to hide a black eye. Before I could even ask, Camilla grabbed ice from the freezer and held it against his face. Just pretend you didn't see anything, she told me coldly. I bent down beside them and asked in a kind but stern voice, tell me what happened. Leave me alone, he said, turning away. I shook my head. I'm not here to lecture you or get mad at you or do anything without your permission. Not even tell your mom. But I need to know what happened. Murph blinked at me and frowned. Someone called me an orphan because I don't have a dad. I patted his head and thanked him, walking away as calm as I could, even though all the blood in my body was boiling with anger. Next afternoon, I took a half day at work and showed up at their school in a rented GTR, strikingly white engine, purring like a monster. I rolled down the window and waved, wearing sunglasses and a black polo. Who's got the coolest dad now? I said loudly, as Murph and his friends ran over excitedly. Murph watched his bully's jaw drop and quickly hopped in. He rolled down the window and flipped him off, which was my signal to immediately drive off the middle school campus. Okay, I like the enthusiasm, but let's never tell your mother about this, I said, grinning. I picked up the other two kids and took them to in N out for a quick afternoon snack, then surprised them with a baseball game. Murph ate in a handful of nachos and I managed to snag a foul ball for little Celia. A bad old man, Camilla said, watching her siblings enjoy the game. We made sure to take pics with the car and at the stadium, all covered in ketchup and mustard. I sent everything to their mom with a caption we wish you were here. After that, things between me and the kids sort of changed. When the youngest, Celia, had a nightmare and called for her mom, I sat beside her bed reading out fairy tales. Until she fell asleep, I made the kids meals and lunch box

When I was 15, my mom discovered my journal where I'd written about kissing a girl from my class. She didn't knock when she barged into my room that night. Just stood in the doorway, clutching my journal with white knuckles. This ends now, she said, her voice terrifyingly calm. No daughter of mine will be this. She couldn't even say the word lesbian. I tried explaining that I was still figuring things out, that it wasn't a big deal. But mom called dad in, showed him the pages. He looked more disappointed than angry, which somehow hurt worse. They scheduled an emergency appointment with Pastor Williams the next morning. Not a therapist, not someone trained in adolescent development. Their church pastor, who believed homosexuality was a choice. Listen. For three hours, I sat in his office while he explained how I was confused, how Satan was testing me. My parents nodded along to everything he said. Mom kept squeezing my hand when I tried to speak. The following week, they announced I was being sent to my aunt for the summer. For your spiritual health, mom said. What she didn't say was that my aunt ran a church camp specifically designed to fix kids like me. Camp restoration was nothing like the name suggested. No crafts or swimming or campfires. Just daily air sessions and one on one counseling that felt more like interrogations. We Were constantly monitored. No privacy in bathrooms, no unsupervised conversations with other campers. One. One night, a girl named Tara tried to run away. They caught her at the fence and made us all watch as they prayed over her for hours, calling out the demons of rebellion and perversion. Two weeks in, I developed a fever. Not just a slight temperature. I was burning up, delirious. The camp nurse gave me some painkillers and sent me back to group sessions. When I collapsed during prayer, they finally called my parents. Mom and dad drove eight hours to get me in the hospital.

So I drove him straight into another state while he slept. Mr Maya was the kind of teacher who got off on making students miserable. In AP history, he'd lean over your desk during tests, breathing coffee breath down your neck while tapping his pen on your paper, just throw you off. And when he handed back essays drowned in red ink, he'd always had his favorite line. In the real world, this wouldn't fly. I spent all junior year counting down to summer, marking days off my calendar like a prisoner, thinking I'd finally be free of his polyester blazers and power trips. So when I walked into driver's ed two weeks later and saw him sitting behind the instructor's desk, my, it dropped like a stone. Where do I turn, I asked during our first lesson, gripping the wheel nervously. You don't turn unless I say to, he barked, making me swerve slightly. Just assume you're going straight until I say otherwise, though with your steering. Straight is a pretty loose term. The two other girls in the backseat exchange looks through the rearview mirror. When Sophia gripped the wheel too tight, he chuckled. Death grip won't help you drive better, sweetheart. This isn't a strength test. Emily stalled at a stop sign and he slapped his knee laughing. And this is why I keep my seatbelt extra tight with you girls. Never know when we're Gonna stop or if we're gonna stop. By the third lesson we discovered his pattern. He'd make his nasty jokes for 20 minutes then use the afternoon drives as nap time while we practice highway driving. Don't worry about that curb you just kissed. He's when I've beard slightly, I'm sure it'll recover from the trauma unlike my neck. When Sophia asked about parallel parking, he laughed. You can barely handle forward parking and you wanna try parallel? That's adorable. He spent the entire next lesson bragging about his important dinner plans with his wife if we survive today's lesson. That is 3 teenage girls driving. I should update my will. One afternoon Sophia slightly veered and he exploded. Jesus, are you trying to collect mailboxes? Cause you're doing great. He wiped tears from laughing so hard. You know girls like you three are why insurance rates are so high and why driving instructors need hazard pay. It's funny because it's true. Then he made his final comparison. My 5 year old nephew has better control of his big wheel than you girls have of this car. He was still chuckling when he added, just try not to kill us while I and then he was snoring head tilted back against the headrest, looked at Emily and Sophia in the rearview mirror and something passed between us. That's when I realized he told me to never turn unless he said so. The interstate entrance was coming up on the right And I could see the big green sign marking I ninety five North hanging over the highway. Like a dare, I tilted my head slightly toward it and Emily caught my glance, following my eyes to the sign before whispering. I didn't hear him say turn, while Sophia nodded slowly and added, me neither. I glanced down at the fuel gauge showing a full tank, then back at the sleeping Mister Maya. And as we approached the on ramp and I felt the car naturally wanting to continue straight onto the interstate, I took a deep breath and tightened my grip on the wheel. Well, he did say to follow his instructions exactly. The merge onto the interstate was smooth and Mister Maya kept snoring while the highway stretched endlessly ahead. Thirty minutes passed, then an hour and his phone started buzzing in the cup holder with increasing frequency. We passed the welcome to New Jersey sign after two hours, making Emily stifle a nervous giggle as his phone lit up constantly with white.

My 16 year old Sophie had been begging for AirPods Pro all summer, the new 300 dollar model. She'd researched every feature, watched countless unboxing videos, even created a detailed comparison chart showing why the Pro version was essential for her aesthetic. Her birthday arrived and I surprised her with the exact model. I was so proud finding them in stock when they'd been sold out everywhere. Her face dropped the second she opened the box. Um, these are the regular AirPods Pro. She held them like they were defective. I specifically said I need the AirPods Pro Max. Everyone at school has the Max version now. These make me look poor. The Max version. This kid wanted the $600 over ear headphones that cost more than my car payment. Her music career consisted of making 15 second TikTok dance videos to trending songs. The Pro version has the same sound quality, I explained, trying to salvage the moment. These are what actual musicians use for professional work. Mom, nobody cares about sound quality. It's about the look. These tiny earbuds are so basic. The max ones are a statement piece. She was already putting them back in the box. Can you just return these and get the right ones? It's only like 300 bucks more. Only 300 bucks more. Like I was made of money. That's stung deep. I'd specifically researched which model music professionals recommended. I'd read reviews, compared Features even asked my friend who works in audio production. I'll think about it, I said quietly, taking the box from her. She was already back on her phone. Thanks, mom. You're the best. Make sure you get the space gray ones, not silver. Silver looks cheap on camera. I just nodded and walked away. Next day, I'm at Apple Store standing in the return line, still feeling terrible about the whole situation. The line was moving slowly and I could hear the customer service conversation happening ahead of me. I'm sorry, ma'am, your card was declined again. Do you want to try a different payment method? I looked up from my phone. A woman about my age wearing scrubs with Maria embroidered on them was standing there with her teenage son. He couldn't have been older than 15, wearing a faded band T-shirt and holding her hand supportively. Um, let me try this one, Maria said, pulling out a different card. Her hands were shaking slightly. Sorry, Miguel. I thought I had enough after paying rent. This one declined too, the employee said gently. The boy immediately stepped forward. It's okay, mom. I don't really need new earbuds for school. My old ones still work fine for online classes. Maria's shoulders sagged like someone had just crushed her dreams. Miho, you've been using those broken earbuds for two years. The left one doesn't even work anymore. And you need them for your virtual music lessons. Maybe next month I'll Have better tips from work, she said, her voice cracking. Your music teacher said you have real talent. You deserve proper equipment. Mom, sharing one earbud with my study group is fine. Besides, my music sounds better when we listen to.

I paid for this so I'm keeping it moment. My ex wife Emma thought she was so clever during our divorce. We've been married eight years and when things went south, she hired this shark lawyer who promised to take me for everything I had. The divorce was brutal. She wanted the house, both cars, half my business and spousal support. Her lawyer kept saying I was hiding assets and demanded access to all my financial records going back five years. But there was one thing Emma really wanted, my signed Jersey collection. I've been collecting them since high school. Mickey Mantle, Joe Montana, Michael Jordan, worth about $30,000 total. Emma hated that collection, always called it my stupid sports shrine and said it was a waste of money. But now that we were splitting up, suddenly she wanted half of everything, including jerseys she'd mocked for years. Her lawyer argued that since we bought some of them during the marriage, she was entitled to 50% of the collection. The Mickey Mantle alone was worth 12 grand. I tried explaining that most of these were gifts for my dad or things I'd saved up for with my own money before we even met. Didn't matter. Her lawyer wanted receipts for everything. So I spent weeks digging through old boxes, finding every receipt, every certificate of authenticity, every piece of paper that proved when and how I got each Jersey. That's when I found something interesting, the Michael Jordan Jersey, the crown jewel of my collection, worth $15,000. I had the original receipt from 2019, but it wasn't purchased by me. It was purchased by Emma as a surprise for my 40th birthday. She'd spent months tracking it down through collectors, paid full price, even had it professionally framed. I'll never forget her face when my lawyer presented that receipt in court. She went completely white as he explained that according to her own legal argument, she just proved the most valuable item in my collection legally belonged to her. Her lawyer tried to backtrack, saying it was a gift and gifts don't count. But my lawyer was ready. He pulled out the divorce papers where Emma's team had specifically argued that the source of payment determined ownership, not the intent. The judge looked annoyed. He asked Emma's lawyer if they wanted to change their legal strategy, which would mean starting the entire asset division process over again. That would cost them another six months and 20,000 in legal fees. Emma was trapped by her own greed. If she backed down, she'd lose her claim to everything else. If she pushed forward, she'd have to give me the Jordan Jersey. While fighting for jerseys worth half as much, her lawyer whispered something in her ear. She shook her head violently. They whispered more. Finally, she slumped back in her chair, looking defeated. Fine, she said through gritted teeth. He can keep his stupid jerseys. But I wasn't done. I Stood up and addressed the judge directly. I'd like to make a counter offer regarding the Michael Jordan Jersey. Everyone looked confused. My own lawyer didn't know what I was planning. According to the receipt, my ex wife purchased this Jersey. According to her legal argument, that makes it hers. I don't want to take something that doesn't belong to me. Emma's eyes lit up. She thought I was giving her a 15 thousand dollar dollar victory. However, I continued. I'd like to.

I was 12 when a man in a blue pickup truck pulled up next to me while I was walking home from school. He asked if I wanted to earn $20 helping him move boxes. My parents had always warned me about strangers, but $20 seems like a fortune to a kid who got $5 allowance. The moment I got in his truck, I knew I'd made a terrible mistake. He immediately locked the doors and started driving in the opposite direction of where he said we were going. When I asked where we were headed, he told me to shut up and sit still. He drove for what felt like hours to a small cabin in the woods. No neighbours, no cell towers, nothing but trees. He dragged me inside and tied me to a chair and what looked like a basement. The smell was awful, like something had died down there. For the first two days, he barely spoke to me except to bring stale bread and warm water. I cried constantly, begging him to let me go home. He just stared at me with these cold, empty eyes and said my parents probably hadn't even noticed I was gone yet. On the third day, he made a mistake. He left his phone on the table while he went upstairs to make himself lunch. I, I could hear him moving around in the kitchen above me, the rope around my Wrists had loosened slightly from struggling and I managed to work one hand free. I grabbed his phone and called the first number I could think of, my mom's work number that she'd made me memorize for emergencies. When she answered, I whispered as quietly as I could, mom, I've been kidnapped. I'm in a cabin somewhere. There are tall pine trees everywhere and I can hear a train in the distance. Before I could say more, I heard his footsteps coming down the stairs. I quickly put the phone back and got my hand back in the rope just as he appeared. He looked at me suspiciously but didn't seem to notice anything different. What I didn't know was that my mom had immediately called the police. While staying on the line, they traced the call and started searching for cabins near train tracks in our area. Meanwhile, she kept calling his phone every few minutes, hoping I'd answer. The next morning, he seemed agitated, kept looking out the windows and pacing around the cabin. I realised later that police helicopters had been circling the area, getting closer to finding us. He started talking about moving me somewhere else, which terrified me. That afternoon, he went outside to load something into his truck. I heard him talking to someone on the phone, getting angry. While he was distracted, I noticed he'd left the basement door unlocked. This was my chance. I quietly climbed the stairs and saw him through The window still arguing on the phone by his truck. The front door was about 15 feet away. I knew I had to be smart about this. If I ran straight out, he'd see me immediately. Instead, I crawled on my hands and knees toward the back of the cabin. There was a small window near the floor that looks like it might be big enough for me to squeeze through. I managed to push it open and wiggle through, scraping my arms and legs on the frame. Once outside, I ran as fast as I could toward the sound of the train tracks. I figured if I could reach them, I might find help or at least know which direction LED back to civilization. My legs felt like jelly from being tied up for days, but pure adrenaline kept me moving. After running for about 10 minutes, I heard dogs barking in the distance. Then I heard voices calling my name. It was the search and rescue team my mom had called in. I screamed as loud as I could and kept running toward the voices. A police officer.

Last summer I got a text welcoming me to basketball dads 2023. Someone named Greg added me saying practice was Tuesdays at 6 and I needed to bring orange slices next week. I don't have kids, I'm not even that into sports, but I had just moved to a new city where I knew absolutely no one and something about being included felt nice so I just replied. Got it, thanks! Chat was surprisingly active. These dads were serious about their 8 year olds basketball league. They discussed zone defense strategies, complained about referee calls, and debated the merits of different sports drinks. I Learned that Coach Tim was too soft on the kids, that Brandon's dad never volunteered for anything, but always criticized that Kevin's son had real potential if he'd just focus more. When it came time for my orange slices, I panicked. Couldn't show up at a random children's basketball practice, so I texted that my car broke down but I'd Venmo someone for the snacks. Dave immediately replied no worries man, we got you. Car troubles are the worst. I sent $15 to Dave and felt strangely good about it. These guys were nice. Weeks passed, became invested in the team's progress. They lost to the Eagles by two points and I found myself genuinely disappointed. I celebrated when little Marcus finally made a basket after trying all season. Greg texted everyone about an end of Season Celebration at his house. All dads expect to attend. I considered coming clean, but by then I've been in the chat for two months. It would be weird to admit I wasn't actually part of their community, so I ghosted, ignored the invitation and subsequent messages asking if I was coming. The chat gradually slowed as the season ended. I figured that was it until three months later when my phone buzzed. Basketball Dads 2,023 has been renamed Soccer Dads fall 2,023 Greg alright, dad adds new season, new sport. Practice starts next Thursday. Dave my Tyler has never played soccer before. Any tips? Mike just buy good shin guards. Remember when Danny got bruised last year? They were back, and somehow so was I. This time I participated more, offering encouragement after games and soccer advice. I quickly researched on YouTube. The group needed a substitute. I nearly had a heart attack. Luckily, Brandon's dad finally volunteered for something. The team scheduled photo day and Greg sent a message. Need to confirm which kid belongs to 5 1 6 5 5 5 5 8 2 4 1 for the roster. That was my number. I froze. After eight months of being a phantom soccer dad, I had no choice but to confess. Guys, I need to tell you something. I don't actually have a kid on the team. I was added by mistake last year and just never left. Sorry for the weird deception. The chat went silent. For a full day. Greg finally

After watching my dad hit my mom for years, I finally hit him back and ended up in a psych ward. They classified me as violent. So I spent 7 months in a white room with nothing but my thoughts. When I was finally released, all I wanted was a family of my own, one built on love, not fear. That's how I met Noah. He was 6, living in a group home after being removed from his fourth foster placement. The social worker warned me he was challenging, code for traumatized. But when I saw him sitting alone, methodically lining up broken crayons by size, something in my heart cracked open. I sat down beside him and asked what he was drawing. Without looking up, he said a house with no yelling. I noticed burn marks on his arms, perfectly circular cigarette burns. I had similar scars, only mine were from my dad's cigars. The first few weeks were rough. Noah tested every boundary, waiting for me to snap. He'd break things, scream that he hated me, try to run away. But I never raised my voice, never threatened, never hit. Instead, I'd sit with him during his meltdowns, speaking softly until his breathing steadied. One night, I found him in the kitchen at 3 a. M. Stuffing cereal into his pockets. I'm not mad, I said, keeping my distance. But can you tell me why his voice was barely A whisper in case you change your mind about me. Like everyone else, I opened the pantry, showing him the extra shelves I'd installed. This is your food, too. You'll never go hungry here, I promise. Slowly, things improved. He started sleeping through the night, stopped hoarding food, called me dad for the first time after I spent hours helping him build a blanket fort. Then he showed up at our door claiming he changed, found god wanted his son. Noah hid under his bed when he heard that voice, shaking so hard the frame rattled. The custody battle was brutal. His father had family money, hired expensive lawyers. They painted me as unstable because of my psych ward. Stay said a single man couldn't properly raise a traumatized child. But Noah's therapist testified about his progress. His teachers described his transformation from a silent, scared kid to an engaged student who helped younger children. The judge listened. The final hearing was yesterday. Noah squeezed my hand so tight it hurt as his father made one last plea. Then the judge looked at Noah and asked what he wanted. He stood up straight, looked his birth father in the eye and said, I already have a dad, the kind who builds forts and doesn't hurt people. Walking out of that courthouse, adoption papers finally signed no. It turned to me, can we get ice cream? Of course, buddy. Dad. Those other foster homes, they said I was too broken. That No one would want to keep me. I knelt down, meeting his eyes. You were never broken. You were waiting for someone who understood. At night, I heard him crying in his room. When I checked on him, he was organizing his crayons again. But this time, he was drawing our house with both of us inside, smiling. See, he said, pointing, no yelling. Now, whenever Noah has a hard day, we build a fort.

I care about my teenage boy, but I'd be dishonest if I said I wasn't let down by the kind of person he's becoming. My son began getting into this different look back when he was in middle school. At first, he just wore black clothes. But once he got to high school, he's gone way too far with his strange style and I really don't like it. My wife doesn't seem to mind, but she's a pretty passive woman and has never been a very strict parent like me. If I were to describe how my son dresses now, he wears big, baggy black clothing and lots of chains and rings. At one point, he was even dying coloured strips into his hair. I remember being so upset the first day I saw this. It was just so embarrassing to see my child walking around like that. Now, I don't have a problem with gay people or anything like that, but I never really wanted that type of thing to be a part of my own household. I've never confronted my son about his sexuality, and I really just don't wanna know. If he does happen to be gay, our relationship is already sort of strained. And I feel like if I found out he wasn't straight, it would make it very hard for me to treat him the same like I Said I don't have a problem with gay people. I just don't wanna be shoved in my face on top of everything. Ever since my son entered high school, he's made friends with mostly girls. At first I was glad to see this and I was happy that my son still might have a chance of growing up into a real man's man. But as time went on, I realised that he wasn't in a relationship with any of these girls dad. They were all just his close friends. He constantly has his friends over the house and is part of a friend group with 3 other girls. To be fair, these girls have always been nothing but polite to me and my wife and are always respectful of our house. Still, it just rubs me the wrong way that my son doesn't seem to have any close guy friends and I feel like it's not good for him to grow up that way. I tried my best to be non judgmental towards my son, even though to me he looked like more of a freak of nature every day the more he kept leaning into his alternative fashion. I didn't understand it since all of his friends were normal girls, he was the only weirdo in his friend group who dressed like some 90s mall rat. When I look at him, he honestly reminds me of the kind of kids I would pick on in high school anyway about A year ago, I ran out of patience with him when he came home one day with his nails painted a shade of bright blue. My son had never done anything like this before and I couldn't help but feel overwhelmingly disgusted. I, I told him that he had gone too far with his emo bullshit and that I couldn't continue letting him make a fool out of himself like this. I told him that at one point he needed to become a man and painting his nails made him look like some sort of weak top. My son and I had never really been close. We didn't even speak that often. So he looked very hurt as I was telling him all this. But I couldn't help it. He had needed a reality check for so long and there was no avoiding this conversation. I told my son to go get nail polish remover and remove his nail polish right there in front of me. That's when he started to get angry and said that he didn't have to change himself just to appease my dumb, a homophobic son. My son has never spoken to either of his parents this way and I knew that there was no way I was letting him get away with it. I yelled at him for cursing at me like that and I told him that he would remove his nail polish immediately or there would be serious consequences. He said that there Was nothing worse I could do to him than continue being such a hateful father? And that's when I lost my shot. I told him that I would ground him for the entire year if he didn't remove his nail polish. Within the next 60 seconds, looked at me and told me that I could try, but I would never be able to control him and that he hated me. He ran up to his room after this and I followed through on my threat. I took his phone away and replaced it with a flip phone and he wasn't allowed to go out or have his friends over anymore. All he did after that for the rest of the year was call his friends in his room and completely ignore me. One night I overheard him crying to my wife about how much he hated his life since being grounded. But all she said was that I was his father and he needed to respect me. Proud of my wife for sticking up to me behind closed doors. And I still felt like I had made the right decision. I won't lie and say that it hasn't been a difficult year. My son stopped talking to me the day I grounded him and I honestly do miss him. He graduates next year and I just hope before then he'll realise that I was only ever trying to do what was best for him.

I need extra hands. Yeah, I don't think so. I wasn't about to climb into a bathroom stall with a freak. No, please. I think I might bleed out. Her voice was shaking, and suddenly this wasn't funny anymore. It was summer from my English class, a pregnant senior who everyone whispered about, but nobody really talked to. She was sitting on the toilet, gripping the handicap rail with white knuckles, and her face was covered in sweat. What's wrong? I asked, even though I was starting to guess. Please do something. I'm giving birth. She looked up at me with pure terror in her eyes. My whole body went cold. I was 17 and barely knew how tampons worked, let alone babies. But she was crying and alone, and I couldn't just leave her there. I hopped over the stall divider awkwardly and almost slipped on the wet floor. That's when I saw it. The baby was already crowning. There was blood on the toilet seat and the floor, and summer was making the low groaning sounds that scared me more than anything. This was actually happening in a gross school bathroom with fluorescent lights and graffiti on the walls. I'll be right back. I ran out of the bathroom, still in shock. I sprinted down the hallway to missus Bashar's classroom. She was my favourite teacher and The only adult I could think of who wouldn't freak out. I burst through her door, interrupting her lecture on photosynthesis. The whole class stared at me. I need your help urgently, please. I was out of breath and probably looked insane. Missus Bashar took one look at my face and followed me without asking questions. We ran back to the bathroom, and I could hear summer sounds getting louder. Other kids were starting to peek out of classrooms, wondering what was happening. Missus Bashar pushed open the stall door and immediately went into teacher mode. Okay, honey, I'm here. You're doing great. I'm going to support you while she gets the nurse. I didn't need to be told twice. I ran to the nurse's office faster than I'd ever run in PE. When I burst through the door, Nurse Patty was checking Casey's temperature. Casey, who everyone knew was Summer's boyfriend, the guy who'd been bragging about becoming a dad at prom. Summer's having her baby in the bathroom right now. I basically screamed it. Casey's face went from white to green. He threw up all over the floor before Nurse Patty could grab a trash can. But we didn't have time to deal with that. The three of us ran back to the bathroom, with Nurse Patty grabbing emergency supplies from her cabinet. By now, half the school had heard something was happening. Kids were crowding outside the bathroom door, trying to figure out what all the screaming Was about teachers were trying to move them back to class, but nobody was listening. When we got back to the stall, it was chaos. Missus Bashar was holding Summer's hand while she pushed. The nurse immediately took over, checking how dilated she was and telling summer to breathe. Casey stood frozen in the doorway, looking like he might pass out. That's when summer grabbed my hand and pulled me close. You have to get

Okay, buzz, time to shut up over there. Um, okay, Brooke, we need an answer. The last person to see you naked was Austin. Austin? Oh, I'm sorry, that's not the day we were looking for. We actually had Lucas on the other line. Now this is awkward. Okay, no, that's not fair, cause it could have been Lucas. It could have been Lucas? Yeah, I'm wondering how many people have seen you naked. No, I mean, no, it was Lucas, but we didn't see each other. The lights were off in our room and. Yeah, so if you say like, who is the last person you were naked with? Then it would have been Lucas. Oh, so it wasn't Austin? No. And how do you think Austin feels about that? I, I don't know. Well, why don't you ask him? Cause he's listening right now. Yeah. Hey Brooke, so what happened to he's sleeping on the couch, I promise. I guess the couch turned into your bed then. Yeah, but nothing happened. But you just said you were naked with him. Okay, but you radio people need to stay the fuck out of this. That's probably what you should have told Lucas.

My family lived by one rule, you pay what you owe, no matter the cost. So when I was 19 and found out my father had borrowed 200,000 from the Koslov family, I knew our lives were over. My father sat at the kitchen table with his head in his hands while my mother paced and chain smoked. The deadline was three days away and we had nothing. Then Boris Koslov himself showed up at our door with his son, Nikolai. Boris looked at me the way you'd examine a car before buying it. He turned to my father and said, your debt disappears tonight if she marries my son. My father didn't even look at me before agreeing. My mother just lit another cigarette and stared at the wall. The wedding happened in Boris's basement. No dress, no flowers, just papers to sign and men with guns watching. Nikolai was 28 and had dead eyes. After the ceremony, he leaned close and whispered, your currency, nothing more. Remember that? The abuse started that first night. He showed me a room in his house with no windows and a lock on the outside. He said that's where I'd live if I caused problems. He monitored my phone calls and read my texts. If I took too long at the grocery store, he'd show up and drag me out by my arm. He'd remind me what his family did to people who betrayed them. How They made examples of entire bloodlines. He installed cameras in every room except the bathroom. When I showered, he'd bang on the door after exactly 10 minutes. He picked my clothes each morning and inspected me before we left the house. If my makeup wasn't right, he'd wipe it off roughly and reapply it himself. He weighed me every week and controlled my portions at meals. Every week we had dinner at Boris's house. I had to sit silent while they discussed their business like I wasn't there. Drug shipments, territory disputes, names of people who wouldn't be problems anymore. Nikolai would rest his hand on my knee under the table, squeezing harder if I showed any reaction. His mother would smile at me and say things like, such a good girl, knows her place. My parents called once a month to make sure I was being good. They never asked if I was happy or safe, just reminded me that my father's life depended on my cooperation. My younger sister wasn't allowed to talk to me because they didn't want her getting ideas. The breaking point came when Nikolai brought home another woman. He made me serve them dinner while they laughed and touched each other. When I dropped a plate, he backhanded me in front of her. She laughed and said, is this the debt payment? She's not even pretty. That night, while they were in our bedroom, I sat in the kitchen and realized I'd rather die. Trying to escape and live another day as property, I started planning carefully. I saved grocery money and tiny amounts and hid cash and tampon boxes. I memorized bus schedule and studied maps during my allowed library time. I smiled more, acted docile, made Nikolai believe I was finally broken. It took six months to save enough for a bus ticket to another state. I practiced walking with different postures in the bathroom mirror and studied accents on YouTube videos during my supervised internet time. You belong to us, I had said once. There's nowhere we won't find you. The night I ran, I left during his poker game when he'd be distracted for hours. I took nothing but the cash and clothes I could layer. I've been putting sleeping pills in his vodka for weeks, tiny amounts so he'd be groggy but not suspicious. At the bus station, I threw away my phone and bought a ticket with shaking hands. For 48 hours, I didn't sleep certain every stop would bring men with guns, which buses three times and doubled back twice to confuse anyone following. In a truck stop bathroom, I cut my hair with stolen Scissors and dyed it black with a box kit. I traded my coat with a homeless woman and bought men's clothes from a thrift store. By the time I reached my destination, I looked nothing like the girl who'd fled. I ended up in a small mountain town where I got a Job washing dishes under a fake name for two years. I jumped at every car door slam and every Russian accent. I moved constantly, never made friends, worked jobs that paid cash. I Learned to spot surveillance, bury my roots and keep emergency bags packed. One day.

What did you learn? When Nathan took me to his family's mansion for the first time, I knew I didn't belong. The driveway was longer than my entire street and their garage held more cars than my apartment building's parking lot. I was a waitress putting myself through nursing school and he was the heir to a real estate empire. I tried hiding my background. At first. I'd make excuses not to go to fancy restaurants, saying I wasn't hungry or had already eaten. When he bought me designer bags, I'd return them secretly and use the money for textbooks. I even practiced using the right forks at dinner by watching YouTube videos late at night. But Nathan wasn't like his family. He drove a beat up Volkswagen and wore the same three hoodies on rotation. When he found out I was returning his gifts, he started buying me practical things instead, grocery store gift cards, gas money, nursing scrubs. Never made me feel small. His mother, Andrea, was different. She'd ask questions like, what country club did your family belong to? Or which prep school did you attend? When I admitted I went to public school, she'd purse her lips and change the subject. Once she accidentally spilled red wine on my only nice dress at a family dinner. Things got worse when Nathan proposed. Andrea cornered me in the kitchen during our engagement party. How much, she asked, pulling out her checkbook. Name your price to walk away. You clearly only want his money. I was hurt but stood my ground. I love your son. I'm not going anywhere. Two weeks later, she showed up at the diner where I worked, ordering coffee and staying for my entire shift. She left religious pamphlets about marrying within your class with her 10 cent tip. My hands shook so bad I dropped three plates that day. Then came the custody battle. Nathan's cousin Amy had lost her kids to social services after a drug relapse. She was rich, well connected and desperate to adopt, but no agency would approve her with her history. That's when she found Tommy. Tommy was a sweet six year old boy from my old neighborhood. Mom was my regular at the diner, a single mother working three jobs. When she got sick with cancer, she asked me to help find Tommy a good home. I promised I would. Nathan and I applied to adopt Tommy. We had a stable home, good jobs. I'd finish nursing school by then and so much love to give. The social worker loved us. Tommy would come for weekend visits and we'd build blanket forts and make homemade pizzas together. But Andrea and Amy had other plans, hired expensive lawyers claiming we were financially unstable. They dug up my father's old Duis, my mother's welfare records. They painted me as white trash trying to climb the social ladder. Through Nathan, the final blow came When they offered Tommy's dying mother $50,000 to change her recommendation to Amy, she was drowning in medical bills. She took the deal. I was destroyed. But Nathan surprised everyone. He walked into the final court hearing and announced he was given.

One day my daughter came back from school and ran into my arms like she was scared. I could feel her shaking so I took her inside and made some French toast, which was her favorite food. I thought she just had a really bad day and missed being at home. But I couldn't have been more wrong. Once she calmed down, she told me, Mommy, something happened today and I think I'm supposed to tell you about it. An uneasy knot formed itself in my heart when she told me that the school counselor had called her into his office for a special game. He handed my daughter a stuffed unicorn and told her that this new game was very popular with the children, which made my daughter excited and eager to learn. Then the counselor made her point the unicorn between his legs and push on it repeatedly. My daughter told me how he made weird faces at times and then closed his eyes and leaned back. Towards the end, I was so horrified and felt a wave of nausea rush through my body so I had to go to the bathroom and throw up. What kind of sick person would make a 7 year old girl do this kind of thing? Not to mention he worked at a school and it was me who willfully sent my daughter near his vicinity. I kept bouncing between blaming Myself and wanting to burn the entire world. My husband was no longer with us, so it was up to me to stand up for my daughter. I don't know what made me approach the school administration before the police, but that's exactly what I did. And the school administration laughed at me, saying that my daughter was clearly playing a prank. They said they had heard other students make similar jokes about the school counselor and said that parents should teach their kids not to lie. By the time I made it to the police station, the school had already called them and explained the situation. They thought I was a crazy mother who was trying to give merit to my daughter's filthy lie. I had looked straight into my daughter's eyes when she told me the story, so I knew she was telling the truth. But no one wanted to believe me. And I felt like I was in a nightmare. This is when I remembered something important and ran back home to open my jewelry safe. Inside there was a note that I hadn't looked at for a long time. You see, although I was currently a doctor, I had been a very inexperienced nurse at one point. And one time a very stern looking man with a lot of face tattoos walked into our hospital with a bullet wound. No other nurse wanted to treat him since he looks so scary. So they sent me. I Convinced myself that everyone deserves treatment and cleaned his wounds with the utmost concentration. I even engaged him in conversation and joked about how he should stay away from bullets in the future. When it was all over, the guy thanked me and handed me a note with his phone number on it. He said, if you ever need someone taken care of, I won't ask for any payment. I typed in that phone number and to my surprise, it actually connected. I told him who I was and he said, I remember you.

My boyfriend Jake, had been the same couch potato for three years. The guy who needed me to open pickle jars was suddenly doing push UPS at 6:00am. When I asked what sparked this change, he just shrugged and said he wanted to get healthy, but something felt wrong. It's started small. He bought protein powder and left it on the kitchen counter like some kind of trophy. Then he got a gym membership to this fancy place across town instead of the Planet Fitness two blocks away. When I suggested we work out together, he got weird and said he preferred going alone to focus. The red flags kept piling up. He started showering immediately after coming home from the gym, which seemed normal until I realized he never smelled like sweat. His gym clothes were always perfectly clean, too. One day I decided to surprise him with lunch at his gym. The guy at the front desk looked confused when I asked for Jake. Turns out he hadn't been there in weeks. Confronted him that night, he got defensive and said he switched gyms because the other one was too crowded. When I asked which gym, he stuttered and said some random name I'd never heard of. That's when I knew he was lying. So I did what any suspicious girlfriend would do. I followed him the next Tuesday. I Watched him drive past three different gyms and pull into the parking lot of a Starbucks. Through the window, I saw him sitting across from this blonde girl who definitely wasn't just a workout buddy. She was laughing at everything he said and touching his arm constantly. My heart was pounding as I watched them for 20 minutes. When she got up to leave, he grabbed her hand and kissed it. I wanted to storm in there and cause a scene, but instead I waited. He came home an hour later with this fake exhausted look, complaining about how intense his workout was. I played along for two more weeks watching him lie to my face every single day. He even started buying workout supplements and leaving them around the apartment as props. The worst part was when he'd flex his non existent new muscles and ask if I noticed any changes. And I got clever. I told him my friend Emma was looking for a new gym and asked for his recommendation. He panicked and said his gym was full and not taking new members. When I offered to call and check, he quickly said they had a waiting list and it wouldn't be worth it. That weekend, Jake said he was going to a special Saturday morning workout class. Instead, I followed him to the same Starbucks. This time they were holding hands across the table and looking at something on her phone together when he leaned over And kissed her forehead. I knew I had enough evidence, but I didn't confront him yet. I had a better plan. I went home and researched the girl on social media, found her Instagram through the Starbucks location tag. Her name was Ashley. And according to her posts, she'd been seeing someone new for the past month. The timeline matched perfectly with Jake's sudden fitness obsession. Monday night, I casually mentioned.

Ever since my son Leo was a little kid, he was just awful to other children. At 5 years old, he was kicked out of kindergarten for backing other kids into corners just to watch them cry. When our daughter Mia was born, keeping Leo away from her was a full time job. We had to move her crib into our bedroom and lock the door just to keep her secure. Later, when Mia was old enough to start losing her baby teeth, we did the whole tooth fairy thing. She put a tooth under her pillow and wake up to a few dollars. But every single morning, after showing us the money, she'd tell us the tooth itself was missing. My husband and I never touched them. Around that same time, Leo claimed the old shed in our backyard as his clubhouse and told us to stay out. But I'm his mother. So one day, I went in to see what he was up to. I found all of Mia's missing teeth laid out in a neat little row on his workbench. Cold feeling wash over me. When we confronted him about it, he just lost it. He screamed horrible things at us before locking himself in his room for three straight days. Over the years, we tried therapy, and he was kicked out of several schools. It wasn't until high school that we saw just how risky he was. One Afternoon a girl from his class knocked on our door. She looked terrified. She told me Leo had been following her home from school every day. She said she was scared for her life and didn't know who else to turn to because no one would listen. My stomach sank. I heard the real fear in her voice, and I apologized over and over. I promised I would talk to him, but deep down I knew it wouldn't do any good. Nothing I said ever did. That afternoon, when I mentioned the girl, he exploded. He started flipping chairs and throwing things across the kitchen. I had to run and lock myself in our bedroom to get away from him. The last thing I heard was him screaming, you'll all pay for this! Before he slammed the back door and went to the shed. I stayed in my room until my husband got home. He saw the broken kitchen window and the mess from Leo's fit and got mad. I'll go talk to him, said. Maybe he'll listen to his father. Then he walked out to the shed. A minute later, I heard a scream that I will never forget. I ran outside and found my husband on his knees in the grass, just crying. He looked up at me and whispered, don't go in there, but I had to see. I ran right past him. When I opened the shed door, I saw him.

She told me Leo had been following her home from school every day. She said she was scared for her life and didn't know who else to turn to because no one would listen. My stomach sank. I heard the real fear in her voice, and I apologized over and over. I promised I would talk to him, but deep down I knew it wouldn't do any good. Nothing I said ever did. That afternoon, when I mentioned the girl, he exploded. He started flipping chairs and throwing things across the kitchen. I had to run and lock myself in our bedroom to get away from him. The last thing I heard was him screaming, you'll all pay for this! Before he slammed the back door and went to the shed. I stayed in my room until my husband got home. He saw the broken kitchen window and the mess from Leo's fit and got mad. I'll go talk to him, said. Maybe he'll listen to his father. Then he walked out to the shed. A minute later, I heard a scream that I will never forget. I ran outside and found my husband on his knees in the grass, just crying. He looked up at me and whispered, don't go in there, but I had to see. I ran right past him. When I opened the shed door, I saw him.

I had stomach problems my whole childhood. Every single time I felt sick, my mom would roll her eyes and say, you're not dying. Go lie down. My dad would just laugh and tell me, she's just trying to get out of chores again. It didn't matter if I was doubled over in pain or throwing up, they always had the same response. Stop being dramatic. Take some medicine. You're fine. By the time I was 14, I had Learned to just suffer in silence. There was no point in telling them anything because they never believed me anyway. One night in October, I woke up around midnight with the worst pain I'd ever felt in my life. It was like someone was stabbing me in the stomach with a hot knife. I was sweating so bad, my sheets were soaked and I could barely stand up without shaking. I stumbled to their bedroom door and knocked softly. Mom, dad, I think something's really wrong. My mom opened the door, looking annoyed. She took one look at me standing there in my pajamas, sweating and shaking, and sighed, Layla, it's the middle of the night. Stop being so dramatic and take some Pepto. We have work tomorrow. But, mom, this feels different. It really hurts and I think I might need to go to the hospital. My dad's voice came from the bed. She's just trying to get attention. Tell Her to go back to bed. My mom nodded and started closing the door. You heard your father. Go lie down and stop waking us up over nothing. I went back to my room and tried to sleep, but the pain kept getting worse. By two in the morning, I was throwing up bile and could barely think straight. I tried walking to the bathroom, but halfway down the hallway, everything went black. My little brother Kevin found me collapsed on the floor at four in the morning. He was only eight, but he started screaming for our parents when he saw me lying there unconscious. My dad came running out, cursing under his breath, what the hell is wrong with her now? He picked me up and carried me to the car, complaining the entire time about how I was overreacting and

I spent 15 years building the internet infrastructure for our small town in Nebraska. Everyone knew me as the internet guy. When your Wi-Fi went down at 2:00am, you called me. When you wanted faster speeds for your home office, I was your guy. What most people didn't know was that I didn't work for some big company. I, I owned every cable, every tower and every router box in town. I was the provider. Everything started falling apart when Jerry Davidson got elected to City Council. This guy had been gunning for me ever since I refused to give him free internet for his campaign office two years earlier. At the first town meeting, Jerry stood up with this big presentation about bringing in competition. We need options, said, pointing at charts showing how much cheaper national providers were. Alex has had a monopoly too long. The new company, Net Connect, rolled into town with promises nobody could refuse, half the price, double the speeds and a name people recognized from TV commercials. They set up a booth at the farmers market offering gift cards just for signing up. Within three months, I watched my customer base get cut in half. By six months, I had maybe 30 customers left out of 800. People stopped waving when they saw me around town. Mrs. Henderson, who used to bring me cookies every Christmas, wouldn't even make eye contact at the grocery store, at Pete's Diner, conversations would stop when I walked in. Some people actually laughed when Jerry made jokes about my outdated service during council meetings. Tried everything. Lowered my prices below cost, offered free installation, threw in premium channels. Nothing worked. Net connected poisoned the well. My savings account hit zero. My girlfriend Katie left me for some guy who worked at the bank. My business was circling the drain and I was three months behind on my truck payment. That's when I started reading contracts real carefully. See, Net Connect had signed a deal with the city to run their fiber cables through existing infrastructure. They were using my utility poles, my access boxes, and most importantly, my signal towers. The contract gave them access, but only if I granted maintenance permissions. Harry had been so excited to stick it to me that he never bothered reading the fine print. When the city originally gave me exclusive rights to install towers 15 years ago, I wrote a clause that let me shut down signal access with 60 days notice. Back then, it seemed like a smart way to protect my investment. Now it was my nuclear option. I spent three nights going through every page of every contract. It connects infrastructure piggyback completely on my original network backbone. They never laid fresh lines because it would have cost millions. They just plugged into what I'd already built and called it an upgrade. On a Tuesday morning, I walked into City Hall and filed my 60 day notice to terminate signal access. Jerry was there picking up some paperwork and saw me at the counter. He asked what I was doing with a smug grin on his face. Just some routine maintenance paperwork, I told him. Netconnect's lawyers showed up exactly one week later.

My 11 year old daughter started acting like a grown woman and I thought it was just early puberty stuff, but then I realized something much darker was happening. My daughter was one of those girls who hit puberty like a freight train. One month she was my little girl in Pokemon t shirts. The next month I was desperately searching the junior section because nothing in kids sizes would button across her chest. I started noticing the attention before I could pretend it wasn't happening. We were at target when she said casual as anything, that the man in electronics had followed us to three different aisles. She didn't sound scared, just stated it like a fact, like she was telling me it might rain. It got bad when she started consuming content that no 11 year old should even know existed. Her iPad history at 2:00am showed romance novels about CEOs and secretaries, bookmark folders labeled Dark Romance and Age Gap. She discovered Wattpad and archive of our own reading explicit stories about innocent girls and men who know better. Her YouTube algorithm had shifted completely. Makeup tutorials for that clean girl aesthetic. How to look expensive, feminine energy that drives men crazy. She was watching videos about how to walk in heels, how to make your voice sound more sultry, how to flirt without being obvious. When I tried to stop her from consuming that Content. She turned into someone I didn't recognize. He started using therapy speak to manipulate every conversation. I was gaslighting her when I set boundaries, being toxic when I said no to crop tops. Emotionally abusive for taking her phone at night. She'd Learned these words somewhere and weaponized them perfectly. Her friend group shifted overnight. The girls her age were suddenly so immature and childish. She gravitated toward eighth graders, then high schoolers, who'd wave at her during pickup. Started lying with disturbing ease. He was at the library, but really at Starbucks with older kids. At Emma's house, but actually at the mall. She figured out how to delete specific texts while keeping others clear. Only certain parts of her history created fake contact names. Emma mom was really someone named Tyler. She started sitting differently, legs crossed like an adult. Hand gestures while talking that she'd copied from somewhere. At family dinners, she'd insert her self into adult conversations about work, drama, and relationships, offering advice like she was 30. When we visited relatives, she spent the entire time with the adults, laughing at jokes she shouldn't understand, making comments about wine and coffee preferences. She didn't have. The secrets multiplied like cancer. Her phone became Fort Knox. Password changed weekly, face ID disabled so I couldn't use it. While she slept, she'd angle the screen away reflexively. Muscle memory from constant deception. I found out from another mom that my daughter had been telling everyone she was 16, not 11. With a whole fabricated backstory about being held back. Started lying about everything. Library visit. It's that were really mall trips with high schoolers, study groups that didn't exist. Sleepovers at houses I never heard of. Her bedroom door stayed locked constantly. Music blasting to cover phone conversation. She stopped talking to me entirely. Dinner became silent warfare. One word answers while scrolling under the table. Her former best friend's mom called concerned. Apparently, my daughter had told the girl she'd outgrown their friendship. At her spring concert, she wore the required black dress, but she'd altered it somehow. Taken in the waist, shortened the hem. She looked like a teenager, not an eleven year old. As she walked across the stage, I watched father's heads turn and follow her movement. These weren't strangers. They were soccer dads, TA volunteers. My neighbor. Their gazes lingered a bit too long before they caught themselves. But what disturbed me most was her awareness of it. She wasn't innocent to the attention anymore. She expected it and seemed to feed off it. After the performance, she didn't run to me like the other kids ran to their parents. She stood with the older performers, laughing at something on someone's phone. When I finally got her attention, she rolled her eyes and mouth. Five more minutes. Like I was embarrassing her. That night, I waited until she would.

He was too scared to call you guys. Oh, okay. Well, that's fine. What's your brother's name? It's Todd. Okay, so what are we doing for you? So Todd has a girlfriend named Renee. She got pregnant, and she told Todd that he's the father. But I think she's lying, and Todd thinks she's lying. Pretty much my whole family thinks she's lying. Oh, okay. So do you think she messed around on your brother, got pregnant, and then told him, surprise, honey, we're pregnant? Yep, that's exactly what I think happened. Okay. Have you told your brother you think that's what happened? Oh, yeah, of course. Actually, I never really liked this girl to begin with, and then when she got pregnant, Todd was the one that came to me and told me that he wasn't sure how it happened. Oh, okay. I mean, well, I can tell you how it happened, but I don't think any of us need those details, so. So your own brother said, I don't think it's mine? Well, I'm his big sister, so I kind of came down on him after she got pregnant, and I was like, how could you be so irresponsible? Yeah, okay. And he was just like, I was responsible every time. Well, maybe he was just saying that so, like, you would get off his back a little. No, he straight up told me. I'm scared to say anything, but I Don't think I'm the one who did it. Oh, okay, well, why is he scared to say anything? Yeah, he's got a right to defend himself, too. That's what I told him. I was like, go and get a blood test done. And he was like, do you know how bad that's gonna look if it turns out I am the father? And I have to say, oops, sorry I accused you of sleeping around on me. It's gonna look like I don't trust her. Yeah, I guess. Yeah, but. But, you know, Jeez, the guy has the right to know the truth. So at this point, he's still with her? Yep. He's just acting like it's his baby and he's gonna stay with her all the way through everything. He's paying all this money for baby stuff, and they're even looking for a place to live together. Okay, meanwhile, you're upset for him cause you don't think it's his. No, I mean, I don't trust her. I never have. I'm sorry. I know that's a terrible thing to say about your brother's girlfriend, but it's true. No, it's. It. Look, I, I had two sisters. They hated almost every girl I ever brought home. I mean, I, I, I told girls that I did. If my sisters like you, then you pretty much passed the test. So you would like to know once and for all, for sure if your brother is really the father of this kid? Yeah. Okay, uh, couple of questions before we move forward this, because this is kind of important. Does your brother know you're doing this? And is he okay with it? Yes, he knows, and he's okay, but he just doesn't want to be involved in it. Okay. And how far along in the pregnancy is this girl? What. What's the girl's name again? Renee. Renee. How far along is Renee? She's about five months. Okay. Now, do you happen to know the name of the doctor she's been seeing for her baby? Doctor appointments or anything? I don't, but I'm sure my brother does. He goes to all the appointments with her. Okay, see if you can get the doctor's last name first, cause that's gonna help us out a ton. Okay. And then also, we're gonna need her phone number, too. Of course. Okay, I'm gonna text my brother right now. Okay, cool. I'm gonna put you on hold the shag while you do that. We're gonna hit a break. When we come back, we'll see if we can figure out the truth about what's really going on. Uh, now, this is the DOC. Do we have the doctor's name? That we don't. We don't have the name. We have the office. We have the office number. That'll work. Okay. Okay, so this is. We're gonna call Renee. Renee is the girlfriend. We're gonna call her and we're going to pretend that we are from the office that she has. Been visiting for her? Yep. Updates or checkups and stuff like that.

Now, according to my mom, I've ruined his wedding. I, 28 m, have a twin brother. Growing up, we were inseparable and until recently, I thought we were still very close. I was always more of a shy nerd and he was an extrovert that played sports throughout our childhood in high school. But we spent almost all of our time together by choice. We went our separate ways. When college came, he stayed local in Arizona and I went to college in Portland. When I graduated, I stayed there because I fell in love with the city. My friends are here. My professional networks from internships were here, etcetera. But I always flew back home for holidays, events, birthdays, etcetera. My brother announced on Instagram that he and his girlfriend of 3 years got engaged. I was incredibly happy for him and texted him congrats. He mentioned they were planning to have an engagement party in 6 to 8 weeks and I told him to let me know so I can book a flight to come celebrate. I was never told a date. If I brought it up with him or anyone in my family, they'd change the subject or say it's still being planned and confirmed. After a few weeks, I texted my brother to ask about The date because it must be getting close and I don't want to pay for a last minute flight. No response. I asked my mom for details and she said it's not really an engagement party, just a small dinner with family. There's no need to come down for it. I eventually found out that it was in fact a big party. They rented out an entire restaurant for four hours and there were about 80 guests, family, friends, cousins, everyone. Everyone was told I couldn't make it. My aunt, who was like a second mother to me, texted me that she was very disappointed I couldn't make time to join. And I replied that I would have happily come, but I was not invited. Word spread quickly about my snub and my parents and brother tried to say it was just a misunderstanding. That was almost over a year ago. Since then, I've tried to get to the bottom of why I wasn't invited over the course of months. It went from it was just meant to be a small gathering to I don't know what happened, there must have been a miscommunication, to it's just a party, it's no big deal. I asked my brother if he was mad at me. I thought maybe his fiance didn't like me, even if she or he didn't want me there. Why were my parents okay with this? This really wasn't like them. Christmas and Easter was awkward because no one But me wanted to address the elephant in the room, and any conversation about anything was like small talk with strangers. When I visited in may for my sister's birthday, I left early after my sister said, you moved so far away, it's like you're not really family anymore. You make everything feel so weird. Now, nine months ago, I got the save a date announcement.

After mom died from cancer, dad sat by her hospital bed for 16 hours holding her hand. He kept saying, I can't do this without you, Sarah. Please don't leave me. The nurses had to give him something to calm down just so he'd let go. When we got home, dad walked around like he wasn't really there. For weeks, he left all Mom's stuff exactly where it was. Her coffee mug sat on the counter with her lipstick Mark. That made me cry. Every morning he asked me, Emma, could you make her chicken Parmesan tonight? It would help me feel like she's still here. While I cooked, dad watched old home videos on repeat in the living room. At first, it was nice hearing Mom's laugh all the time and pretending like she was still with us. But as winter turned to spring, Dad's sadness shifted into something scary. He stopped sleeping in their bedroom and moved to the couch, telling me, I can't sleep in there, Emma. It smells like her perfume and I hear her breathing. At 3 in the morning, I'd find him hugging her pillow, talking to nobody. I suggested therapy and he actually agreed to go twice a week. But it wasn't long before I found appointment cards in the trash. One April night when I came out of the bathroom, he called me Sarah in the dark hallway. He immediately followed up with, sorry, Emma, you Just you looked like her for a second. His apology was anything but reassuring because something in his eyes had changed. I reminded him, dad, I'm Emma, your daughter. And he nodded slowly without saying anything. I thought it would end there, but he called me Mom's name more and more. I tried to tell myself it was just part of the process. That's when he started buying me the same clothes mom wore. These ugly flower shirts kept showing up in my closet and he'd lie they were on sale and I thought you'd look nice in them. When I told them that they were Mom's style, he'd just say exactly with this sickening smile. My shampoo kept getting replaced with Mom's brand and when I switched it back, it would mysteriously change again within days. Then one morning, all my stuff had been moved to their bedroom. When I asked why, through tears, he said, I need you close, Sarah. Emma, I mean, Emma, the nightmares are getting worse. That was the last time he called me Emma. I could tell something terrible was coming, but nothing could have prepared me for their anniversary morning. I woke up to him on my bed with a breakfast tray, roses everywhere, candles burning and their wedding song playing. He smiled and said, happy anniversary, my love. I can't believe it's been 20 beautiful years of marriage. I sat up fast and said, dad, what the f is this? Suddenly I Was hit with a wave of dizziness. When I tried to catch my balance, he smiled. You've been so tense recently, Sarah, so I put anxiety medication in your water. I sat there helpless as he pulled out red undergarments. He held it up saying, you wore this on our wedding night. Time to put it on again. I shook my head hard and said, dad, please, you're scaring me. I'm Emma. But his eyes looked empty. When I pushed the tray away, he grabbed my wrist hard. Why are you acting like this, Sarah? He said, while I screamed, mom is dead. I'm Emma. I'm your effing daughter. His twisted and he yelled, stop lying. You're my wife. You've always been my wife. He lunged forward, trying to kiss me, hands, grabbing at my chest while saying, this is our anniversary. Stop pretending you don't remember our first time. I screamed, get off me, and bit his lip until it bled. As I stumbled to the bathroom, he called, Sarah, come back. Don't lock me out on our special day. I barely locked the door before he got there. He pounded on it saying, I'll be gentle, I promise, just like our first time. Please don't be scared, my love. When I didn't respond, his tone shifted to anger. Sarah, open this door right now. A wife doesn't lock out her husband. All I wanted to do was call for help, but I didn't have my phone on me. When I heard him punching through the door, I screamed, help, somebody help me. Thankfully, somehow my neighbor, Mister Lee, heard dad was able to unlock the door after he punched through it. And he had this sick smile. My skin crawled when he said, there you are, sweetheart. No more hiding, catching me with a needle. This will help you remember who you are. I fought back as hard as I could, though I knew he could overpower me. But everything stopped when Mr Lee pounded on our front door. John, is everything okay in there? He yelled. Dad called out, everything's fine, Tom. Sarah is just having one of her episodes again. But Mr Lee yelled back.

In high school, my friend Arthur started this game called Awkward Questions. The rules were simple. You had to ask your teacher the most uncomfortable but technically appropriate question. Question. Possible points based on how flustered they got it started innocent. Missus Williams, do you think Romeo was taking advantage of Juliet? Five points for her nervous laugh. Mister Davis, why do we study the Great Depression when we're living through 1? 10 points for his visible confusion. But Arthur was competitive. He kept pushing boundaries, hunting for that perfect question that would break a teacher completely. His target was Mister Wayne, our AP chemistry teacher. Guy was unshakable. Thirty years of experience, seen every teenage trick in the book. Arthur spent weeks researching, looking for the perfect chemistry related question that would crack him. Then he found it. I found out later that Arthur had been digging through old local newspaper archives for weeks. He found a 10 year old obituary for Bruce Wayne, age 16. Died from accidental chemical poisoning. Arthur connected the dots. Same last name as our teacher, same small town. He found Mister Wayne's deceased brother. During class, Arthur raised his hand with that evil grin we all knew meant trouble. Mister Wayne, I was reading about chemical compounds last night. Is it true that when you mix household bleach with ammonia creates chlorine gas? Mister Wayne froze. Why would you ask that, Arthur? Arthur leaned back. In his chair, savoring the moment. Just curious about the chemical reaction. You know, for educational purposes. The teacher's face went white. Arthur, I need you to stay after class. We thought Arthur had finally won the game. Mister Wayne looked genuinely shaken. After class, Arthur was practically bouncing with excite. This was his masterpiece. Mister Wayne locked the door and sat down heavily. Arthur, where did you learn about that specific reaction? Just some research I found online, Arthur said, barely containing his smirk. That's when Mister Wayne broke down crying. And Arthur started smiling. You know about Bruce, don't you? Arthur smile faded. He hadn't expected this reaction. Mister Wayne's younger brother had passed away from exactly that chemical mixture. The family tragedy destroyed his parents marriage and sent his mom into severe depression. Mister Wayne became a chemistry teacher specifically to educate kids about chemical safety so no other family would go through what his did. Arthur had deliberately weaponized the teacher's worst trauma for points in a game. He reported Arthur to the principal for psychological harassment and requested a transfer to another school district. Within a week, the story spread. Parents heard about a student psychologically torturing a teacher, about his deceased brother. Words spread fast. Parents found out a student had deliberately targeted a teacher's family tragedy for a game. Arthur got expelled, not suspended, expelled. His college applications were destroyed. Every university rescinded their offers when they Learned what he'd done. Mr. Wayne Had a complete mental breakdown next day. 28 years of teaching and Arthur's calculated cruelty shattered everything he built to cope with his deceased brother. He started having panic attacks in class. Couldn't sleep. Kept seeing his dead brother's face in every student. The school had to call paramedics twice when he collapsed. His wife found him three weeks later, talking to his brother's photo, planning a chemistry lesson for him. He was admitted to a psychiatric facility. He's still there. Arthur's parents sent him to military school in another state. His dad was so ashamed, he wouldn't even drive him there. The worst part. Arthur's younger sister goes to our school now. She gets bullied constantly because everyone knows what her brother did. Kids call her psycho Arthur's sister and avoid sitting near her. She had to switch lunch periods because someone put a fake obituary in her locker with her name on it, saying she passed away from accidental chemical poisoning by her brother. All because Arthur thought targeting a teacher's dead brother would be hilarious. The game ended that day. None of us could stomach it anymore. Arthur had won, but he destroyed everything in the process.

My boss, Rachel, is basically the coolest person at our advertising agency. Last month, she sent out the group text about her party on Friday night. Everyone was hyped, talking about it during lunch breaks, planning what to wear, the whole thing. But I never got the text. I figured maybe she just forgot to add me or maybe my phone was being weird. Thursday rolls around and I'm hearing more party talk. People are discussing who's bringing what drinks and someone mentioned the karaoke machine. Starting to feel pretty left out, but I don't wanna seem desperate by asking about it. Friday afternoon comes and everyone's buzzing about getting ready after work. That's when I finally worked up the courage to walk into Rachel's office. I knocked on her door and she looked up with this bright smile. Hey, what's up? She said, I took a deep breath. So, um, I think there might have been a mix up. I didn't get the text about tonight's party. Her face immediately changed like all the color just drained out of it. She stared at me for what felt like forever before clearing her throat. Oh, right about that, she started fidgeting with her pen. The thing is, this party is more of a core team event. Core team. I've been there for two years. I worked overtime constantly and never complained. I brought donuts every Friday and covered for People when they were sick. What do you mean core team? I asked. She couldn't even look at me. Well, you know, people who are more central to the office dynamic. That hit me like a punch to the gut. I just nodded and walked out. The whole office cleared out at 5 sharp and I sat there alone pretending to work while everyone else headed to have fun without me. But here's where it gets interesting. Around 9 that night, I get a call from my friend Jamie who works in accounting. She's whispering and sounds panicked. Dude, you need to check Rachel's Instagram Story like right now. I open Instagram and there's Rachel's story from the party. Everyone's having a blast, dancing, playing beer pong. But in the background of one video, I see something that makes my blood boil. There's a whiteboard with party planning written at the top. And underneath it says who not to invite with my name right at the top of the list. But that's not even the worst part. Next to my name, someone had written too weird and kills the vibe. Other people had similar mean comments next to their names. Basically, anyone who wasn't part of Rachel's little inner circle got roasted on this board. I screenshot everything before she could delete it. Then I spent the weekend thinking about what to do. Monday morning, I walk straight to HR with the screenshots. Turns out excluding employees from company sponsored Social events based on personal preferences is a huge liability issue, especially when there's written evidence of the reasoning being discriminatory. HR launched an investigation immediately. Within a week, three people had come forward saying they felt excluded and harassed by Rachel's click behavior. Apparently this has been going on for months and I was just the first person brave enough to speak up. Rachel got fired two weeks later, not just for the party thing, but they discovered she'd been playing favourites with assignments, giving her friends easier projects and better reviews. The new boss they brought in, she's way more professional and actually treats everyone equally. We still have office parties, but now everyone gets invited properly and no one keeps mean lists. Best part is Rachel tried to get unemployment but got denied because she was terminated for misconduct. I heard through the Grapevine that she's working at a call centre now.

I used to work as a prison guard and one day our warden decided it would be a good idea to bring his 10 year old daughter in so she could see where dad works. He left her alone in his office for just a minute. When she wanted out, he found her 10 minutes later in one of the corridors bleeding out from her head with a fly on her pants undone. Watching him clutch her against his chest and hold her lifeless body repeating daddy's got you, sweetheart for hours was a sight I'll never forget. From that moment on, he became obsessed with finding out who did this. He didn't even take a day off from work, just came in next morning off, no sleep, spent the whole day grilling every prisoner in guard. He offered bribes, reduced sentences, special privileges, anything for information. I remember watching him break down between interviews then slam his head into the wall repeatedly just so the physical pain could momentarily drown out the emotional one for long enough to conduct the next interview. He grounded everybody he thought gave suspicious answers and threatened them with solitary confinement, beatings, firings for guards. He even went as far as forcing a prisoner to wear a wire during yard to hopefully catch an admission, threatening that prisoner with an extra two years to his sentence if he didn't wear it. Unfortunately, his interviews didn't get him an answer. So He started becoming more harsh. Two and a half weeks after the death, he came into work hammered and grabbed me by the shoulders, telling me today was the beginning of the end. He then rounded up all the prisoners and announced to them that until the truth about who did it comes out, they would only be getting fed every second day. The backlash was brutal and the warden took that as a sign that the people protesting were guilty. Got a hold of everyone who stepped out of line and ordered us, the guards, to beat them. Some guards, including myself, felt bad and didn't want to. But he threatened our jobs, saying if we're hesitating, then that means one of us must have called his daughter. He'd pace her.

Well, what's a good way to start a healthy relationship? Get drunk and hook up in the back of a car. There's other options.

We don't get a lot of people saying yes to the second dates because they're usually weird. I guess what it takes is somebody getting a Car in order to make it happen, you gotta make an offer they don't refuse. Yeah, I am freaking out right now that this is actually happening. Well, will you guys keep us updated on what happens, please? Okay. Will you send us pictures of your new car? Yeah, I wanna ride. Oh my gosh. Okay. All right. Well, hey, Roger, before we go, I do have a question for you. Yes. Do you need any friends? You're so crazy. You guys are my friends now. Okay.

So I treated her exactly like I treat my other friends. With boundaries. Tara and I had been together for two years, living together, for one. We were talking about future plans, her sister's wedding next summer, where I was supposed to be her plus one. Then on a random Thursday evening, she sat me down for the talk. I love you, but I'm not in love with you anymore. She said, I think we should transition to being friends. Get along so well, have the same friend group. We'd make amazing friends. But not amazing partners. Here's what killed me. She said all this while already having packed a bag. Her friend Marissa was picking her up in an hour. She planned this whole thing down to having somewhere to stay, already got an exit strategy. I said, we're adults. We're friends. We can make this work. I sat there processing. Two years living together, talking about kids someday. Now she wants to be buddies? Okay. I said, yeah, let's be friends. She actually smiled, relieved, like I just agreed to her perfect plan where she gets to dump me but keep all the benefits of having me in her life. The next morning, I did exactly what Tara asked. I treated her like a friend. That's when I Learned she had a very different definition of friendship than I did. First text came at 7:00am. Could you Drop off my work laptop? Sure. I'll leave it at the front desk of your office Monday. Can't you bring it by Marissa's? I need it for the weekend. I've got plans. Monday works better. She didn't like that. But what was she going to say? We're just friends now. Week two, Tara started cracking. She showed up at the apartment while I was at work. Still using her key. Helped herself to groceries, did laundry, took a shower. I texted her, I'll need the key back. My friends don't have keys to my place. This is ridiculous. We live together. We used to live together. Now we're friends. Different relationship, different boundaries. She came by that evening, furious. You changed the locks. You no longer live here. Here's a box of your stuff. I'm treating you exactly like I treat my friends. None of them have keys to my place. But I'm not just any friend. According to you, that's exactly what you are. The real kicker came at game night with our friend group. I showed up solo. She showed up with some dude named Connor from yoga, clearly trying to make me jealous. I shook his hand, welcomed him, then proceeded to destroy everyone at code names while paying them zero attention. Halfway through the night, Tara cornered me. You don't even care that I'm here with someone else? Why? Why would I? We're friends. Friends date people. She couldn't answer because there was no answer. That Didn't admit she wanted me to pine for her while she found herself. But the best part, her bestie Marissa had been extra friendly all night. Kept finding excuses to talk to me, laugh at my jokes. This morning, Tara texted. What was that with you and Marissa? We were just talking. Friends talk. She's my best friend. And I'm your friend, too, right? Friends can be friends with each other's friends. By week three, Connor from yoga had ghosted Tara. Meanwhile, Marissa invited me to a comedy show. The date was fantastic. She was actually hilarious. Something I'd

My brother Jake has this girlfriend named Becca who literally cannot stand not being the center of attention for five minutes. Every family dinner, every holiday, every gathering, she finds a way to make it about her. Last Thanksgiving, she announced she was pregnant right when my dad was about to carve the Turkey. Turns out she wasn't even pregnant. Just wanted to see everyone's reactions. So when I was planning my wedding to my fiance Ryan, I knew I had to do something about the Becca situation. This was going to be my one day. The one day that was supposed to be about me and Ryan starting our life together. I called Jake about three months before the wedding. Hey, so about the wedding I started. I need to ask you something kind of awkward. What's up? He said, and I could hear him eating cereal in the background. I really don't want Becca there. I know that sounds harsh, but she always makes everything about herself, and I just can't deal with that stress. On my wedding day, the line went quiet for, like, 10 seconds, and Jake exploded. Are you serious right now? You're uninviting my girlfriend from your wedding? I'm not uninviting her because she was never invited in the first place. The invitation was just for you. That's the same thing. We've been together for two years. She's basically family. I tried To explain that it wasn't personal, that I just wanted one drama free day. But Jake wasn't having it. He said if Becca couldn't come, then he wouldn't come either. I told him that was his choice. Think he changed his mind? He didn't. But here's where it gets crazy. The day of my wedding, I'm getting my makeup done in the bridal suite when my cousin Madison bursts in. Uh, you need to see this, he says, shoving her phone in my face. It's Becca's Instagram story. She's posted, like, 15 videos of herself getting all dressed up, doing her makeup, picking out jewelry. The caption on the last one says, can't wait to celebrate love today. With a bunch of heart emojis and the location tagged as our wedding venue. My heart drops. He's coming anyway. Madison nods. Jake's outside right now, arguing with your dad about it. He says he changed his mind and decided to bring her. I'm standing there in my wedding dress, half my makeup done, and I have to deal with.

When I was 15, my mom discovered my journal where I'd written about kissing a girl from my class. She didn't knock when she barged into my room that night, just stood in the doorway clutching my journal with white knuckles. This ends now, she said, her voice terrifyingly calm. No daughter of mine will be this. She couldn't even say the word lesbian. I tried explaining that I was still figuring things out, that it wasn't a big deal. But mom called dad in, showed him the pages. He looked more disappointed than angry, which somehow hurt worse. They scheduled an emergency appointment with Pastor Williams the next morning. Not a therapist, not someone trained in adolescent development, their church pastor who believed homosexuality was a choice. For three hours, I sat in his office while he explained how I was confused, how Satan was testing me. My parents nodded along to everything he said. Mom kept squeezing my hand when I tried to speak. The following week, they announced I was being sent to my aunt for the summer. For your spiritual health, mom said. What she didn't say was that my aunt ran a church camp specifically designed to fix kids like me. Camp Restoration was nothing like the name suggested. No crafts or swimming or campfires, just daily air sessions and one on one counseling that felt more like interrogations. We were Constantly monitored, no privacy in bathrooms, no unsupervised conversations with other campers. One, one night, a girl named Tara tried to run away. They caught her at the fence and made us all watch as they prayed over her for hours, calling out the demons of rebellion and perversion. Two weeks in, I developed a fever. Not just a slight temperature. I was burning up, delirious. The camp nurse gave me some painkillers and sent me back to group sessions. When I collapsed during prayer, they finally called my parents. Mom and dad drove eight hours to get me in the hospital.

When I was 15, my mom discovered my journal where I'd written about kissing a girl from my class. She didn't knock when she barged into my room that night, just stood in the doorway clutching my journal with white knuckles. This ends now, she said, her voice terrifyingly calm. No daughter of mine will be this. She couldn't even say the word lesbian. I tried explaining that I was still figuring things out, that it wasn't a big deal. But mom called dad in, showed him the pages. He looked more disappointed than angry, which somehow hurt worse. They scheduled an emergency appointment with Pastor Williams the next morning. Not a therapist, not someone trained in adolescent development, their church pastor who believed homosexuality was a choice. For three hours, I sat in his office while he explained how I was confused, how Satan was testing me. My parents nodded along to everything he said. Mom kept squeezing my hand when I tried to speak. The following week, they announced I was being sent to my aunt for the summer. For your spiritual health, mom said. What she didn't say was that my aunt ran a church camp specifically designed to fix kids like me. Camp Restoration was nothing like the name suggested. No crafts or swimming or campfires, just daily air sessions and one on one counseling that felt more like interrogations. We were Constantly monitored, no privacy in bathrooms, no unsupervised conversations with other campers. One, one night, a girl named Tara tried to run away. They caught her at the fence and made us all watch as they prayed over her for hours, calling out the demons of rebellion and perversion. Two weeks in, I developed a fever. Not just a slight temperature. I was burning up, delirious. The camp nurse gave me some painkillers and sent me back to group sessions. When I collapsed during prayer, they finally called my parents. Mom and dad drove eight hours to get me in the hospital.

We all knew Holly would let the world burn if it meant keeping girls safe. She literally treated female friendship like a sacred religion. She'd walk wasted girls home from parties, share her last tampon with girls she'd never met, and somehow knew which guys to avoid before anyone else did. Every girl had her number saved for emergencies because they could all count on her to fix things. There was this one time at lunch when the football players were ranking girls by their bodies out loud. Holly walked right up to their table, took photos of all of them, and announced she post them on the school's parent Facebook age with exactly what they've been saying unless they apologize to every single girl individually. That was Holly's whole identity. She lived for female solidarity. She'd stay up all night talking girls through breakups, pretend to be someone's girlfriend to get creeps to back off, fight with teachers who dress coded girls unfairly. During junior year, when the cheerleaders started that toxic diet competition, Holly brought homemade cookies every day until they stopped weighing themselves. The girls would cry on her shoulder, trust her with their darkest secrets, and she treat protecting them like her life's purpose. Then winter break passed, and Holly showed up wearing headphones, staring at her phone, completely ignoring the circle of girls who'd been waiting to tell her their break Drama when Neva ran up crying about her boyfriend cheating, Holly literally stopped around her and kept walking. She didn't hold the door for the freshman girl carrying too many books. Didn't smile back at anyone. During lunch, Amira was sobbing about her parents'divorce, and Holly would have normally dropped everything to comfort her, but she sat alone the entire time. The worst part was when Sienna fainted in the hallway from not eating. Old Holly would have been the first one there. This. Holly glanced over, watch the nurse handle it, and went back to her homework. Girls kept approaching her all day. Summer needed a tampon. Holly shrugged and said she didn't have one. Freya asked for a ride home because she felt unsafe. Holly said, call Uber without looking up. We all thought she was going through something heavy, maybe seasonal depression, maybe family problems. Some girls organized an intervention. They cornered her after school with flowers and her favorite coffee. Hallie took one look at them and said, I'm not interested. Just that. Then walked to her car. Days turned into weeks. The girls went from concerned to desperate. They made a schedule to check on her, left notes in her locker, even got the counselor involved. Hallie told the counselor she was focusing on herself and there was nothing wrong. When that didn't work, they told one of our teachers. She asked Hallie why she wasn't helping organize the Women's Empowerment Orman Assembly. Halle responded, That's not my responsibility anymore. Then we all found out what happened. During a massive New Year's Eve party at Wyatt's house. Halle had gone with her closest friends, prepared to be designated driver and protect anyone. But then someone spiked her drink, and she started feeling really sick and disoriented. She'd managed to lock herself in an upstairs bathroom when she realized something was seriously wrong. Holly had texted the group chat with her friends, the ones she called her soul sisters. She typed, please help. Something's wrong. I think someone put something in my drink. I'm scared. I locked myself in Wyatt's bathroom. Please come get me now. Then another. I can't stand up properly. Please hurry, then.

So I'm 23, oldest of five kids, and basically running my parents house like I'm the damn manager or something. I'm in school full time getting my second degree, plus I work part time in my field. My employer already said they'll take me full time once I graduate, so I'm making decent money for a student. Enough to pay for school and actually save some cash. My siblings are 20, 17, 14, and 10. My parents both work. Dad pulls crazy long hours and mom does the 9 to 5 grind at some stressful job. So guess who picks up all the slack? Me. I do literally everything. Grocery shopping every week, all the laundry for seven people, cooking dinner every single night, and meal prep on Sunday so everyone has lunches ready. I even manage my siblings chores like making sure there's dog food in the pantry so my youngest brother can actually feed our two dogs. Or that we have poop bags on the leashes. It's like being a mom to four other people. Plus going to school during Christmas break. I finally had enough saved up to buy myself a PS five. Been wanting one forever and I found one at regular price. But if you know anything about PS Fives in 2022 was basically winning the lottery. The rest of my family still shares this old PS four in the living room, but I Keep mine in my room. It's mine, I bought it. And no, I don't share it. Well, my 20 year old brother Jake started whining to my parents about how unfair it was that I had all this money and cool stuff but wouldn't share. Like, dude, get a job, but whatever. So my parents call me into the kitchen for this family meeting, which was basically them telling me I need to start paying rent. They said it wasn't fair that I was making good money while living there for free. Especially when I won't even share my gaming console. I just sat there listening to them explain how much they wanted from me monthly. And I'm doing the math in my head. After rent, I'd have maybe $800 left over each month. That's after buying my own food, gas, school supplies, everything. I went to my room and actually calculated it out on paper. If I dropped a couple classes next semester, I could go almost full time at work. It would only add one more year to my degree, but I could afford my own place. And here's the kicker. I'd actually have more free time and way more spending money than if I stayed home paying rent while doing everyone's chores. So I packed up my stuff. Everything I owned fit in my Honda Civic, which honestly was kind of depressing, but also liberating. I didn't tell them I was leaving until I was loading my Car, where are you going? My mom asked, standing in the driveway in her bathrobe. Getting my own place. Thanks for helping me realize I can afford it. I stayed at this Airbnb for two weeks while I figured out apartments, adjusted my class schedule, and got more hours at work. The Airbnb host, this older lady named Beverly, kept asking if I was okay because I was just so happy to be there. Like, I was literally excited to do my own laundry. And. Okay, I'm not gonna lie. I went a little crazy on dating apps. Living at home with 4 siblings and strict parents meant I hadn't had any.

I jerked upright in bed, heart pounding against my ribs. What are you talking about? I don't do that. He held up his phone screen, glowing in the darkness of our bedroom. I have it on video, Julia. Every single night I watched myself on the hallway camera footage, standing perfectly still at our six year old daughter's door. Two kitchen knives clutched in my hands, one in each fist. The time stamp read 12:03 a m. That's not possible, I whispered. But there I was, motionless for hours. According to the fast forward layback, miles scrolled through multiple recordings from the past week. Same position, same knives, same bacon expression on my face. I had absolutely no memory of any of it. How long has this been happening? I asked, my voice cracking. Miles pulled up the footage history on his phone. I installed the camera a month ago when Mary mentioned hearing footsteps. Thought maybe she was sleepwalking. He showed me night after night of recordings. You stand there from midnight until almost 4:00am. Then you just walk back to bed. We reviewed more footage together. Sitting at the kitchen table with his laptop, I appeared at eleven fifty eight PM in every video. Retrieved the knives from the kitchen drawer and took my position like clockwork. Miles had dark circles under his eyes. I hadn't noticed. Before, I didn't want to scare you, but this isn't normal. Julia. We need to get you help. Have you asked Mary about this? I managed to ask. He nodded slowly. She says she hears tapping on her window sometimes. I checked outside, but never found anything. My blood turned cold. Tapping on her window. I instinctively stood up and walked to the knife drawer, pulling it open. The two largest knives were at the front, handles facing out. Had I arranged them that way? That night, I forced myself to stay awake. Miles set up his phone to record me, and I sat on the couch drinking coffee. At 11:45 p m, a strange heaviness washed over me. I fought against it, digging my nails into my palms. The I hit 11:00am and everything went black. I woke up at 407:00am, standing in our bedroom, miles staring at me with wide eyes. You just stood there again. I tried to talk to you, even shook you, but you were completely gone. He showed me the new footage. I looked like a statue. Unblinking, unmoving. Except for the subtle rise and fall of my chest. The next morning, I examined Mary's window from outside. Small scratches marked the frame, concentrated around the lock. Fresh marks overlapped older ones. My hands trembled as I took photos. Miles called the police while I questioned Mary. Tell me about the tapping sounds, sweetheart. She looked up from her coloring book. They stopped. A While ago. Now I just hear you walking around outside my door. Officer McCoy arrived within the hour and exam in the window. These are tool marks. Probably from someone trying to Jimmy the lock. She photographed everything meticulously. Has anyone been watching your house? Any strange vehicles? We couldn't think of anything unusual. She recommended motion sensors for the backyard and extra locks on Mary's window. Miles installed cameras outside that afternoon. If someone's been trying to get in, we'll catch them. That night, he stayed awake to monitor all the feeds while I inevitably blacked out. He kissed my forehead at 11:45 p m. Maybe your subconscious knows something we don't. At 12:47 a m, according to Miles's frantic retelling the next morning, a figure appeared at Mary's window. Dark clothing, face obscured by a hood. It produced a thin metal tool and worked at the lock while I stood guard inside. Knives ready. The figure tried for 20 minutes before giving up and disappearing into the shadows. Miles had called 9 1 1 immediately, but the intruder vanished before police arrived. Officer McCoy reviewed the footage with us. The build looks familiar. Height about 5 feet, 10 inches. The way they moved. She paused the video. Do you recognize anything? That's when it clicked. Light hunch of the shoulders. The way they favored their left hand. Oh, my god. That's Isaac, our babysitter's boyfriend. The police moved fast. They arrested Isaac that morning at our babysitter's apartment. The search warrant revealed the worst possible outcome his lap

You get nothing when we die. Then Grandma's lawyer called. The call came while I was eating cereal before my shift at the auto parts store. Austin called. Well, this is Margaret Stevens, state attorney. Your grandmother, Eleanor, left you something. I almost laughed. There's been a mistake. My parents said I wasn't in her will. Mr Caldwell, we need to meet immediately. Two hours later, I'm staring at documents, $2.1 million a house, investment accounts all mine. But I'm adopted, I stammered. Margaret handed me a letter in Grandma's handwriting. Austin, you are not adopted. You're my biological grandson. Your father's first wife, Jennifer, was your real mother. She died when you were 2. Susan made David pretend you were adopted because she wanted you gone. My hand shook. 21 years of being treated like garbage while my siblings got cars and vacations. I work two jobs just to afford ramen. Every family dinner where they discuss college funds for Logan and Ashley. But when I asked about help with community college, dad would say you need to learn independence. Letter continued, David and Susan think they're inheriting everything. They've been spending money they don't have. The new truck, kitchen, remodel, Logan's boat they borrowed against my estate. They get nothing. But there was more. Margaret pulled out another folder. Your grandmother hired a private investigator three years ago. She documented everything. Photos of me walking to work in the rain because my bike Broke screenshots of my parents social media posts bragging about their inheritance windfall while I lived on peanut butter sandwiches. Messages between Susan and her friends. Can't wait for the old bat to die so we can finally live properly. The investigator had recorded conversations too. Susan's voice came through crystal clear. Austin thinks he's family, but he's just David's mistake from his first marriage. Once Eleanor's gone, we'll have enough money to cut them off completely. Your grandmother was furious. Margaret said she changed her will six months ago. Your parents get nothing. Your siblings get $1,000 each. Everything else goes to you. The best part, the investigator had proof they'd already spent $200,000. They didn't have new credit cards, loans against their expected inheritance, deposits on a vacation home in Florida. I drove to their house with Margaret. It was Friday night, their weekly family dinner that I was never invited to. Through the window, I could see them celebrating with champagne and expensive takeout. Susan opened the door, saw us both, and her face lit up with greed. Finally, Margaret right. How much did mother leave us? We've been waiting so patiently. Logan and Ashley crowded behind her, practically bouncing with excitement. David appeared with a bottle of champagne, ready to toast their good fortune. I smiled. Actually. She left me everything and this letter explaining how you lied about me being adopted. Susan's face went white. That's impossible. You're not even real family. Oh, but I Am I pulled out the birth certificate get grandma had kept safe. My mother was Jennifer Caldwell, you know, Dad's first wife, the one you made him pretend never existed. David's champagne bottle slipped from his hands, shattering on their expensive marble floor, the floor they'd renovated with money they thought they'd inherit. This has to be a mistake, Ashley whispered. Margaret stepped forward. There's no mistake. Austin inherits two point one million dollars, the house and all investment accounts. You three children each receive $1,000. David and Susan receive nothing. Nothing. Susan's voice cracked. But we borrowed, we spent, oh, about that $200,000 you borrowed expecting your inheritance. I held up the legal paper. The bank wants it back tomorrow with interest. Logan started crying. But my boat payments, the vacation, house deposit, not my problem. I said. Maybe you should have treated your brother better. David finally found his voice. Austin, please, we can work this out. We're family. No, I said, looking him dead in the eye. Jennifer was family. Grandma, Eleanor was family. You're just the people who made my life hell for 21 years. Margaret handed them the official paper, papers you have 30 days to vacate any property belonging to the estate. Austin is the sole heir. As we walked away, I could hear Susan screaming at David, Ashley sobbing about her college fund being gone, and Logan frantically calling someone about returning his boat. Justice tastes sweeter than any inheritance money ever could. The house keys felt perfect in my hand.

I stared at Missus Peterson through my screen door, coffee mug frozen halfway to my lips. I don't mow my lawn with Scissors. That's insane. She shifted uncomfortably on my front porch, clutching her robe tighter against the morning chill. Well, someone does. Every Sunday at exactly 4 in the morning, I hear this snip snip snip sound coming from your yard. It wakes up my whole house. I glanced past her toward my front lawn, which looked perfectly normal. Green, well maintained, clearly cut with a regular mower, like every other yard on open Drive. Missus Peterson, I use a gas mower on Saturday afternoons. You've seen me do it dozens of times. Her expression shifted from annoyed to confused as she followed my gaze to the obviously machine cut grass. But the sound is definitely coming from your property. My husband heard it, too. What exactly does it sound like? I asked, stepping outside in my pajamas to get a better view of my yard. Missus Peterson made a cutting motion with her fingers, like someone trimming hedges, but rhythmic snip snip snip for hours. I walked around to my backyard, with her following close behind, both of us scanning for anything unusual. That's when I saw them. Tiny, perfect circles cut into the grass near my back fence, each about six inches in diameter, not random patches. But precise geometric patterns carved into the lawn with surgical precision. Missus Peterson, I didn't do this. My voice came out smaller than intended. The circles formed a complex design that would have taken hours to create with Scissors. And I've been found asleep every Sunday at 4:00am for the past month. I pulled out my phone and took photos of each circle, documenting the strange pattern while Mrs. Peterson watched nervously. The cuts were too clean for animals, too precise for lawn equipment, too deliberate for vandalism. Someone had been accessing my backyard weekly to create these designs while I slept. Have you seen anyone in my yard? I asked, but she shook her head. Her bedroom window faced the front of my house, not the back. I walked to my rear gate and found what I was looking for. Fresh scratches around the lock mechanism, tiny metal shavings on the ground. Evidence someone had been picking the lock repeatedly. My stomach dropped as I realized a stranger had been entering my property for weeks without my knowledge. Missus Peterson, I need to check something inside. I ran to my security system panel and pulled up the motion detector logs. Every Sunday for the past six weeks, the backyard sensor had triggered at exactly 3:00am, then again around 7:00am. But I dismissed these as false alarms from neighborhood cats. I scrolled through the digital records, finding the same pattern week after week. Someone had been studying my routine, waiting For me to fall into deep sleep before beginning their mysterious lawn art project. The precision of the timing suggested they knew my schedule better than I did. I called the police while Mrs. Peterson waited in my kitchen, both of us staring out the window at those perfect circles. Officer Bradley arrived within twenty minutes and examined the evidence with growing concern. This level of precision suggests obsessive behavior, he said. Photographing the circles and the damaged gate lock. Someone's been planning this for weeks, possibly months. He pointed to older scratches around the lock that I'd never noticed. These marks go back further than six weeks. This person's been accessing your property much longer than the lawn cutting. I felt violated in a way I couldn't articulate. Someone had been treating my home as their personal art studio while I slept defenseless inside. The officer recommended changing all my locks immediately and installing motion activated cameras throughout the backyard. Two weeks later, my new security cameras captured everything. Exactly 3:00am on Sunday, a figure in dark clothing climbed over my back fence and began the meticulous process of cutting grass with small scratching Scissors. But when I reviewed the footage in daylight, zooming in on the person's face, my world tilted completely. It was my ex boyfriend, Nathan, who had broken up with eight months ago after discovering he'd been secretly filming me in my own bathroom. The same Nathan who'd sworn he'd leave me alone after I Threatened a restraining order. The same Nathan who apparently still had a key to my back gate and when we dated, and had been using it to continue violating my space in increasingly elaborate ways. The circles weren't random art. When I printed out photos of all the patterns and arranged them chronologically, they spelled out words. Mine in the first week, forever in the second, watching in the third. Nathan had been leaving me messages in my own lawn, counting on my Assumption that the noise was just. Neighborhood maintenance Officer Bradley arrested Nathan the following Sunday as he climbed over my fence with his Scissors and a flashlight. The investigation revealed he'd been documenting his visits with photos, keeping a detailed journal of my daily routines, and planning to escalate to breaking into my house. Nathan got 18 months in jail for stalking and trespassing. I got new locks, better security cameras, and the knowledge that someone cutting grass at 4:00am is never just about lawn care.

Growing up, my dad had one phrase that he loved. My house, my rules. When I was 16 and wanted to dye my hair purple for junior year, he stood in the bath from doorway, blocking my path. Not under my roof, Alexis. You want purple hair, get your own place. When my boyfriend asked me to prom, dad made him sit through a two hour interrogation before declaring, no dating until you're 18. My house, my rules. I couldn't even watch PG thirteen movies until I was 17 because inappropriate content isn't welcome under my roof. My friends stopped coming over after dad made them sign a behavioral contract to enter our home. He controlled what I wore. No ripped jeans in my house. You look homeless. What I ate vegetarian phase. Not at my dinner table. And my opinions, too. You don't get to disagree with me while you're living rent free. When I got accepted to art school, he laughed. Art degree? Not with my money. You'll study business or nothing. Mom would whisper apologies when he wasn't looking, but never stood up to him. The worst part was his favourite closing line whenever I protested. When you have your own place, you can do whatever you want. Don't like it? There's the door. He'd literally point to the front door, knowing I had nowhere to go. At 17 with eight. Two dollars, In my savings account. Life isn't fair, Princess. The person who pays the bills makes the rules. Remember that. Well, I took student loans and went to art school anyway, living in a studio apartment with three roommates and a family of roaches. Dad called it learning life the hard way. Should have listened to me about that business degree, he'd say during Sunday dinners, while I was building my graphic design portfolio at 3 a m. Dad was getting comfortable in early retirement at 55, spending his days watching Fox News and calling me to criticize my lifestyle choices. Still living in that dump, he'd ask. Still single because you're too picky? Still wasting time on those computer drawings? His words hurt, but I kept going. Meanwhile, his perfect life started cracking. Mom finally left him after 30 years, tired of the controlling behavior. She's going through menopause, he told everyone, refusing to admit she'd simply had enough. Then his health declined, and he got diabetes. From decades of my house, my beer choices. He even refused to take his medications properly, because no doctor tells me what to do in my own home. Next, his house started falling apart, with a roof leaking and the foundation cracking. But he was too proud to ask for help. And too cheap to hire anyone. I built this house. I'll maintain it my way. By the time I landed my senior design director position, making six figures at 29, Dad was 67, living alone in a deteriorating house, alienated from most family members and struggling with basic tasks, but still preaching about his rules whenever anyone would listen. Then one day, my phone rang and his name popped up. Alexis. How's my successful daughter? Red Flag already? He never spoke that nicely. What do you need, dad? Can't a father call his daughter? You only call when you want something. Long pause. The house is getting to be too much. Your mother used to handle things, but now she's gone. I was thinking maybe I could stay with you for a while. I knew this was coming. He'd been posting on Facebook about his struggles, fishing for sympathy. But I wasn't going to just refuse because I had a secret plan. So I told him, of course you can stay with me. Dad. I have a

We all knew Holly would let the world burn if it meant keeping girls safe. She literally treated female friendship like a sacred religion. She'd walk wasted girls home from parties, share her last tampon with girls she'd never met, and somehow knew which guys to avoid before anyone else did. Every girl had her number saved for emergencies because they could all count on her to fix things. There was this one time at lunch when the football players were ranking girls by their bodies out loud. Holly walked right up to their table, took photos of all of them, and announced she post them on the school's parent Facebook age with exactly what they've been saying unless they apologize to every single girl individually. That was Holly's whole identity. She lived for female solidarity. She'd stay up all night talking girls through breakups, pretend to be someone's girlfriend to get creeps to back off, fight with teachers who dress coded girls unfairly. During junior year, when the cheerleaders started that toxic diet competition, Holly brought homemade cookies every day until they stopped weighing themselves. The girls would cry on her shoulder, trust her with their darkest secrets, and she treat protecting them like her life's purpose. Then winter break passed, and Holly showed up wearing headphones, staring at her phone, completely ignoring the circle of girls who'd been waiting to tell her their break Drama when Neva ran up crying about her boyfriend cheating, Holly literally stopped around her and kept walking. She didn't hold the door for the freshman girl carrying too many books. Didn't smile back at anyone. During lunch, Amira was sobbing about her parents'divorce, and Holly would have normally dropped everything to comfort her, but she sat alone the entire time. The worst part was when Sienna fainted in the hallway from not eating. Old Holly would have been the first one there. This. Holly glanced over, watch the nurse handle it, and went back to her homework. Girls kept approaching her all day. Summer needed a tampon. Holly shrugged and said she didn't have one. Freya asked for a ride home because she felt unsafe. Holly said, call Uber without looking up. We all thought she was going through something heavy, maybe seasonal depression, maybe family problems. Some girls organized an intervention. They cornered her after school with flowers and her favorite coffee. Hallie took one look at them and said, I'm not interested. Just that. Then walked to her car. Days turned into weeks. The girls went from concerned to desperate. They made a schedule to check on her, left notes in her locker, even got the counselor involved. Hallie told the counselor she was focusing on herself and there was nothing wrong. When that didn't work, they told one of our teachers. She asked Hallie why she wasn't helping organize the Women's Empowerment Orman Assembly. Halle responded, That's not my responsibility anymore. Then we all found out what happened. During a massive New Year's Eve party at Wyatt's house. Halle had gone with her closest friends, prepared to be designated driver and protect anyone. But then someone spiked her drink, and she started feeling really sick and disoriented. She'd managed to lock herself in an upstairs bath through when she realized something was seriously wrong. Holly had texted the group chat with her friends, the ones she called her soul sisters. She typed, please help. Something's wrong. I think someone

I jerked upright in bed, heart pounding against my ribs. What are you talking about? I don't do that. He held up his phone screen, glowing in the darkness of our bedroom. I have it on video, Julia. Every single night I watched myself on the hallway camera footage, standing perfectly still at our six year old daughter's door. Two kitchen knives clutched in my hands, one in each fist. The time stamp read 12:03 a m. That's not possible, I whispered. But there I was, motionless for hours. According to the fast forward layback, miles scrolled through multiple recordings from the past week. Same position, same knives, same bacon expression on my face. I had absolutely no memory of any of it. How long has this been happening? I asked, my voice cracking. Miles pulled up the footage history on his phone. I installed the camera a month ago when Mary mentioned hearing footsteps. Thought maybe she was sleepwalking. He showed me night after night of recordings. You stand there from midnight until almost 4:00am. Then you just walk back to bed. We reviewed more footage together. Sitting at the kitchen table with his laptop, I appeared at eleven fifty eight PM in every video. Retrieved the knives from the kitchen drawer and took my position like clockwork. Miles had dark circles under his eyes. I hadn't noticed. Before, I didn't want to scare you, but this isn't normal. Julia. We need to get you help. Have you asked Mary about this? I managed to ask. He nodded slowly. She says she hears tapping on her window sometimes. I checked outside, but never found anything. My blood turned cold. Tapping on her window. I instinctively stood up and walked to the knife drawer, pulling it open. The two largest knives were at the front, handles facing out. Had I arranged them that way? That night, I forced myself to stay awake. Miles set up his phone to record me, and I sat on the couch drinking coffee. At 11:45 p m, a strange heaviness washed over me. I fought against it, digging my nails into my palms. The I hit 11:00am and everything went black. I woke up at 407:00am, standing in our bedroom, miles staring at me with wide eyes. You just stood there again. I tried to talk to you, even shook you, but you were completely gone. He showed me the new footage. I looked like a statue. Unblinking, unmoving. Except for the subtle rise and fall of my chest. The next morning, I examined Mary's window from outside. Small scratches marked the frame, concentrated around the lock. Fresh marks overlapped older ones. My hands trembled as I took photos. Miles called the police while I questioned Mary. Tell me about the tapping sounds, sweetheart. She looked up from her coloring book. They stopped. A While ago. Now I just hear you walking around outside my door. Officer McCoy arrived within the hour and exam in the window. These are tool marks. Probably from someone trying to Jimmy the lock. She photographed everything meticulously. Has anyone been watching your house? Any strange vehicles? We couldn't think of anything unusual. She recommended motion sensors for the backyard and extra locks on Mary's window. Miles installed cameras outside that afternoon. If someone's been trying to get in, we'll catch them. That night, he stayed awake to monitor all the feeds while I inevitably blacked out. He kissed my forehead at 11:45 p m. Maybe your subconscious knows something we don't. At 12:47 a m, according to Miles's frantic retelling the next morning, a figure appeared at Mary's window. Dark clothing, face obscured by a hood. It produced a thin metal tool and worked at the lock while I stood guard inside. Knives ready. The figure tried for 20 minutes before giving up and disappearing into the shadows. Miles had called 9 1 1 immediately, but the intruder vanished before police arrived. Officer McCoy reviewed the footage with us. Bill, looks familiar. Height about 5 feet, 10 inches. The way they moved. She paused the video. Do you recognize anything? That's when it clicked. The slight hunch of the shoulders, the way they favored their left hand. Oh, my god. That's Isaac, our babysitter's boyfriend. The police moved fast. They arrested Isaac that morning at our

My best friend Ford, had the craziest parents. Last year, when he got an 89 on a pre test, they completely lost it. They blamed his social life and said, you're not allowed to take one step out of this house except for school. No exceptions. And they weren't kidding. He literally wasn't allowed to go to birthday parties, field trips, or even study groups. Saying, your friends are distractions. From now on, you focus only on academics. We tried to convince them that none of those things were a distraction, but they refused to listen. So when I handed Ford an invitation to my birthday, he handed it back with a deep frown. Sorry. You know, they'd never let me go. The whole not a single step out of this house rule, remember? But that's when my friend Logan had an idea. Then let's just carry you out. We stared at him, thinking it was the most ridiculous thing we'd heard. But when you fight crazy with crazier. Well, it was worth a shot. So we showed up to Ford's door for the first time with our first attempt, a rolling office chair. I rang the doorbell and took a deep breath. Good afternoon, Ford's wonderful parents. I need Ford for a group project. Oh, no. He strictly can't take one step out of the house. Yes, we know. So he won't. Ford grinned, seeing Us through the doorway and quickly leapt onto the office chair. He'll be in this seat the entire time. Not one step. Ford's parents stared like it was the stupidest thing they'd ever heard. But they couldn't exactly argue against it, either. So Ford rolled all the way to my birthday party. The next time we showed up, his mom instantly said, no rolling chairs allowed. Logan shrugged. Already prepared. Two other guys popped out from the bushes and helped us literally carry Ford out on our shoulders, like they do in funerals, but without the cat. Get you! Said he can't leave. We're removing him. That's the same thing, she argued. No, no. This is involuntary relocation. We kept switching up tactics. Every time, a new part of the rule got added. Can't exit the house through any doorway. We brought a ladder to his window and transported him away with a shopping cart. Can't leave without a chaperone. We printed out a cardboard cut out of his dad and carried that around, too. At some point, Ford managed to leave the house to go bowling with us just by dressing up in a costume and saying, well, I'm not Ford right now. I'm Iron Man. Unfortunately, that was the final straw. After his last stunt, Ford got completely grounded. No door, no phone, no anything. It's over. They won, I said, feeling down that he wasn't even able to go to the class's end of the year party. But Logan wasn't ready to give up. Logan gathered everyone and said, if Ford can't leave, I say we bring the party to Ford. Everyone cheered at the idea, and honestly, it was the best one he had yet. So that Saturday night, 30 of us showed up at once, carrying around our world history textbooks. Study group. Ford answered the door with a shocked expression. My parents just stepped out. What are you guys doing here? We grinned. Well

The courtroom erupted until I stood, handed the judge a two page document, and said, check again. Judge simply looked at my wife and burst out laughing. My name is James, and three months ago I caught my wife Lauren cheating with her yoga instructor. She filed for divorce immediately, thinking she'd hit the Jack pot. Since we've been married for five years. Lauren strutted into that Phoenix courtroom wearing a two thousand dollar dress I'd bought her, confident as hell. Her lawyer was already calculating his commission on what they thought would be a four million dollar payout for my construction business and dad's inheritance. The whole courtroom was packed. Lauren had actually invited some of her friends to watch what she called James's comeuppance. She been telling everyone for weeks how she was about to become independently wealthy. Your honor, her attorney announced, adjusting his expensive tie, missus Peterson deserves substantial compensation for supporting her husband's career growth during their five year marriage. Lauren actually winked at me from across the room. She thought I was just some heartbroken guy who'd roll over and pay whatever she demanded. Her friends in the gallery were practically grinning, waiting for the show. But here's what Lauren didn't know. Six months before I caught her cheating, I'd started noticing weird charges on our joint credit card. Expensive dinners at restaurants I've never been to, Hotel rooms booked during girls trips that didn't add up. Designer lingerie purchases that never made it home. The final straw was when I found an eight hundred dollar charge at a jewelry store downtown. When I asked Lauren about it, she said she bought herself a birthday present. Problem was, her birthday wasn't for four months. So I hired a private investigator named Frank. Best five thousand dollars I ever spent. Frank followed Lauren for six weeks, but he discovered was worse than I imagined. The yoga instructor was just the latest in a long line of affairs. There was also her personal trainer, a bartender from her favorite restaurant, and even one of my own business partners. Lauren had been using our joint accounts to fund these relationships. Expensive gifts, romantic getaways, even paying for her affairs. Gym memberships. She'd blown through nearly $50,000 of our money over two years. The two page document I handed Judge Ramirez wasn't financial records. It was Frank's detailed investigation report proving Lauren had been having multiple affairs for over two years. Complete with time stamped photos, hotel receipts, restaurant bills, and screenshots of explicit text messages. In Arizona, adultery doesn't automatically disqualify you from alimony. But it sure does when you've been systematically draining marital assets to fund your affairs. It's called waste of marital property, and it's a big deal in divorce court. The judge read the first page slowly, his eyebrows climbing higher with each line. To page two. Study the photos and then burst out laughing so hard his glasses nearly fell off. Mrs. Peterson, he said, trying to compose himself, not only are you getting nothing from this divorce, but according to this evidence, you owe your husband $47,000 for system malicious misuse of marital funds. Lauren's face went from smug to confused to horrified in about three seconds flat. Her friends in the gallery started whispering frantically. One of them actually got up and left. Her lawyer immediately started packing his briefcase, clearly realizing this case had just become a career nightmare instead of a payday. Furthermore, Judge Ramirez continued, given the extensive documentation of financial misconduct, Mrs. Peterson will be responsible for all legal

Then I saw the group photo. All of them, on a private beach in Maui. I stared at my phone in disbelief. My entire family had ditched my wedding for a vacation. The caption read, finally together. Like I didn't exist. But here's what they didn't know. For years, I've been quietly bankrolling their lifestyle. The family business cards all linked to my accounts. Their mortgage co signs my credit. The lake house utilities, auto pay from my bank. I've been the invisible ATM, funding their perfect lives while they whispered that my wife wasn't their kind of people. So I sent one text back. Perfect timing. Then I called my attorney. Within an hour, I'd cut off every shared account, canceled every auto payment, and revoked access to everything. The secondary property my sister lived in. She was using my credit for the rate. Not anymore. It started small. Day 3, the dealership called about a bounced car lease. Day 5, the office building sent late rent warnings. By week 2, the group chat was pure your chaos. Can someone cover the lakehouse utilities? My card got declined for Scottsdale. Does the company still cover insurance? They were scrambling, but still no apology. Just confusion about why their money fountain suddenly dried up. Then my sister called. First time since the wedding. Not congratulations or sorry we missed it. Just. You can't do this to us. I Didn't even answer. Just blocked the number. But the real fun was just beginning. See, I'd forgotten about one little detail. My dad's precious boat. The 40 foot yacht he loved showing off at the Marina every weekend. Guess whose name was on the insurance policy? Week 3, I got a call from the Marina. Sir, your boat insurance was declined for non payment. We need it removed by Friday or it gets impounded. I could have warned him. Should have, maybe. Instead, I drove to the Marina Thursday night with my wife and a bottle of champagne. We sat on the dock and watched them tow away Dad's pride and joy. My wife raised her glass. To new beginnings. To expensive lessons. I replied. The group chat exploded. The next morning, my aunt was practically screaming in all caps, the boat is gone! Who didn't pay the insurance? Dad called me 17 times. I let every single one go to voicemail. Each message got more desperate. Son, please call me back. There's been some mistake. We can work this out. Work what out? That I skipped my wedding for cocktails on a beach? Then my mom tried a different approach. She showed up at my office unannounced, tears streaming down her face. Security called up to ask if I wanted to see her. Tell her I'm in Maui, I said. The security guard paused. Sir, she says she's your mother. Not anymore. But the nuclear option came when my Uncle called. Uncle Rick, the family mediator. The guy who always smooth things over at Thanksgiving. His voice was shaking. Your father's having chest pains. The stress is killing him. You need to stop this. Funny, I said I had chest pains, too. Right around the time I saw 40 people I love. Choosing a vacation over the most important day of my life. That's different, friend, and you know it. You're right. Their betrayal was a choice. His consequences are karma. But then came the lawyers. Three weeks later, they tried to negotiate through legal channels. They wanted me back, but only if I left my wife. The contract literally said realignment of personal affiliations. That's when I knew they still

I slammed on the brakes and jumped out of my car. Nora, baby, what are you doing out here? She was shivering violently. And just her school clothes, no coat. Tears frozen on her little cheeks. Daddy locked me out. He said, I can't come back until you get home from work. My heart dropped. It was 9 p m. On a Friday. Jonathan knew I always worked late on Fridays. This wasn't an accident. How long have you been out here? Since you left this morning, she whispered. I scooped her up, feeling how ice cold her little body was, and carried her toward our front door. It was locked. I used my key. Fury building with every step. I found Jonathan exactly where I expected. Sprawled on the couch in his boxers and T-shirt, controller in hand, playing call of duty. The heat was cranked up to 75 degrees. Empty beer cans littered the coffee table. Why was our daughter outside for 12 hours? I tried to keep my voice calm. He didn't even pause his game. She spilled grape juice on my new controller this morning, I told her. Actions have consequences. I stared at him in disbelief. She's 6 years old, Jonathan. She spilled juice accidentally and you left her outside to freeze? Maybe next time she'll be more careful around my stuff. That's when I noticed Nora's pink backpack sitting by the front door. It was soft, full, bulging at the seams. Her favorite stuffed bunny was sticking out the top. What's this? I pointed at the bag. Jonathan finally paused his game and turned to look at me. There was something cold hold in his eyes I've never seen before. I've been doing a lot of thinking today. While she was outside, he said slowly, this whole family thing isn't working out for me. Nor is too much work, too expensive, too loud. And honestly, I never wanted kids in the first place. The room started spinning. What are you talking about? I'm talking about you taking her and leaving tonight. I already had the locks changed while you were at work. You just got lucky I hadn't switched them out yet. I felt like I was in a nightmare. You're abandoning your own daughter? Nora was still clinging to me, her wet clothes soaking through my work blazer. She was listening to every word, her big brown eyes darting between us. Here's the thing. Jonathan stood up like this was all perfectly normal. She's not really mine anyway. I mean, yeah, biologically, whatever. But I never signed up for this dad life. You can have her. The casual cruelty in his voice made me sick. This was the man I've been married to for eight years. The man who used to read Nora bedtime stories. Jonathan, she's your daughter. You can't just watch me He picked up his phone. I already talked to my buddy Steven, who's a lawyer. Apparently, if I just voluntarily give up my parental rights, I don't have to pay child support either. Win win. My hands started shaking, but not from fear. From rage. I pulled out my phone and speed dialed a number I'd hoped I'd never have to use. Hi, Christine. It's Caroline. Remember that emergency custody documentation we discussed six months ago? File everything. Tonight. Jonathan's controller slipped from his hands. What are you doing? What you should have expected when you decided to mess with my daughter. I hit another number. Dad, it's happening. Can you come get us? Bring the truck. Caroline, you can't just take her. Jonathan jumped up from the couch. I smiled, and I knew it looked cold as ice. Actually, I can see. Jonathan, I've been documenting your behavior for months. The times you called Nora a mistake. The texts where you said you wished she'd never been born. The videos of you screaming at her for normal kid things. His face went completely white. My lawyer has everything. Screenshots, recordings, witness statements from the neighbors who've seen how you treat her. I kissed Nora's forehead. She was finally starting to warm up in my arms. Oh, and here's my favorite part.

When I was 17, my classmate Derek threw 50 bucks at me in the school parking lot and desperately said, I need you to be my boyfriend for one hour to scare off my mom's church friends. His mom thought he was gay because she found his elaborate skincare routine and absolutely freaked out. She was bringing her entire prayer circle over for what she called a healing intervention to save Derek's soul from eternal damnation. Act super gay and make them uncomfortable, Derek explained frantically while pacing nervously. They'll get so weirded out they'll pack up and leave within 20 minutes. Easy money, right? I showed up at exactly three PM wearing the tightest jeans I could squeeze into and a bright pink shirt. I knocked on the door and screamed Derek, baby, so loud that neighbors three houses down started coming outside to see what catastrophe was happening. His mom answered with five absolutely horrified church ladies clustered behind her like a religious huddle. Prepare, preparing for spiritual warfare. I immediately bear hugged Derek and loudly announced Sweetie Pie. I brought us matching cucumber face masks and a carefully curated playlist of Broadway show tunes for a romantic spa day. Derek's face went completely pale, but I was fully committed to this Oscar worthy performance. For the next hour, I went into full theater kid mode like my life depended on it. I called him Sugar Plum Honey Bunny and my precious little cinnamon roll. I critiqued his mom's curtain choices with the intensity of a professional interior designer, started reorganizing their entire spice rack alphabetically while humming songs from Hamilton loudly complained that their throw pillows didn't match the seasonal aesthetic vision I was going for. The church ladies looked like they were watching a slow motion car crash that they couldn't look away from. One kept fanning herself frantically with a church program. Another was gripping her purse like it was a life saver in a stormy sea. Then I made my absolutely fatal mistake. I, I spotted their old dusty piano sitting in the corner and declared dramatically with full jazz hands, Derek, Honey, let's sing that special duet we've been practicing for the school talent show. Without waiting for his response, I launched into the most ridiculously over the top rendition of a Whole New World that is ever been performed outside of Broadway. Derek just stood there completely mortified and frozen like a deer in headlights. When I finished with a dramatic flourish, the church lady slowly started clapping. Then another joined in. Then all five of them erupted in thunderous applause like I had just performed at Carnegie Hall. Young man, the head church lady said with actual tears streaming down her weathered face. That was the most beautiful soul stirring thing I've ever heard in my entire life. Derek, you absolutely must.

I responded, bros before hoes, but moms before all. And everyone cracked up. Jason didn't smile, though. His face drained of color like I just confessed to murder. He grabbed all his stuff and moved 3 rows up the school bus without a word. Jason, what's wrong? I was just kidding. I called after him, but he wouldn't turn around. That's when I heard it stay. See, my girlfriend's best friend was crying her eyes out in the back row. When I turned to look, her friend whispered urgently in her ear and she glanced at me before crying harder.

And at the red light, I caught the bus driver wiping his eyes in the rearview mirror. In my three years of knowing him, the most emotion he'd shown was mild annoyance when kids left trash on the seats. A cold feeling crept into my stomach. I got up to go talk to Jason, but Missus Unfitzharris blocked the aisle. Sit down. We're moving. I just need to sit down. I'd never heard her voice like that. I sat. But the second we got to the destination, I cornered Jason. Dude, what is going On he backed away. Nothing. I just, I need space, bro. I was just kidding. I, I don't know if I'd pick my mom or my girlfriend. Why did you have to tell everyone what I said? Sid appeared out of nowhere and pulled me aside. Our team captain who never said more than pass the ball to me, grabbed my shoulders. Bro, if you need to talk about anything, I'm here. About what? I was almost shouting now. He just squeezed my shoulder and walked away. That cold feeling in my stomach was spreading. During the water break, Ryan shuffled over. This kid didn't even know my name. Yo. The blonde Kaylee from volleyball thinks you're cute. She's single now, too. The words hit like a punch. Dude, what the hell. I flashed him my lock screen. I have a girlfriend. His face went white. Just trying to help you move forward, man. Move forward. From what? He practically ran away. I tried calling my.

Oh, yeah, you like that? I yelled into my headset microphone. Beg daddy for more! I added. Just. My wife busted through my door. Gotcha! My wife shouted. Dozens of people poured into the room, glaring at me. My parents, her parents, my best friend, and even a lawyer were all there to witness the greatest misunderstanding of all time. So I told my wife I needed to focus for two hours because I had an important commitment with friends. I locked my office door and put a cute little do not disrupt sign on the outside. My wife ended up walking by and hearing me through the door, growling, yeah, baby, just like that. That's exactly what I've been asking for. She froze and pressed her ear against the door. Oh, Adam, you're so good at this! A high pitched feminine voice said, giggling. Are you staying on all night? I need you. My wife's hands started shaking. Her heart pounded. She heard me laugh and say something about getting dirty and going all night. She stumbled to our bedroom and sat on the bed staring at nothing. When I came out two hours later, I kissed her goodnight like nothing happened, not realizing that my wife was already brewing up a plan on how she'd end me. My wife started sitting beside my locked door, secretly recording all of the suspicious sessions on her phone. She caught the Female voice taunting Adam, is that the best you can do? And me responding with, I'm gonna destroy you so hard. Yes, daddy! The female giggled. My wife even managed to record me saying, I spent $500 on her last night, and I do it again. She's perfect. He's everything I wanted. With all the male voices congratulating me. My wife was understandably furious, showing the recordings to her sister. That's definitely a woman, her sister said. And she sounds young. Oh my god. Is your husband. Is he having an affair? They went to a divorce lawyer the next day. He listened to the recordings and nodded grimly. Get video evidence, he said. Get witnesses. We'll bury him in court. My wife assembled what she called the intervention team. Both sets of parents, my best friend, who she convinced would be saving me from myself, the lawyer with his phone ready to record, her sister with her phone is backup. Even our neighbor, who was just happy to be a part of something fun. We'll catch him mid fair, my wife said with rage in her eyes. And she did catch me doing something, just not what she was expecting. So that night, during my usual gaming session time, the entire intervention team burst through my door. Gotcha! My wife yelled, but everyone else just froze, staring at me and my computer monitor showing a cartoon dragon breathing rainbow fire at a bunch of wizards in ridiculous clothes. Um. Can I help you? I asked, blinking back at them. Adam! The high pitched female voice shrieked through my speakers. Did you just go AFK during the boss fight? We're dying here! My wife pointed at the speakers frantically. There! That's her! That's the woman he's been cheating on me with! What? Cheating? I pulled up my discord window and showed them the five male friends I've been gaming with every week. Ray, Simon, and three random teens that kick butt at the game. That voice you've been hearing. That's Ray, I said, pointing to the bald guy on the screen. He waved and said hi. With the female voice changer still on. Everyone took a step back in horror. He quickly turned the voice changer off. Oh, sorry about that, he said, now in his regular voice.

I said, fair enough, and quietly canceled our 85,000 dollar wedding. Her face went pale when she got the cancellation notice. I'm watching my ex fiance Bianca blow up my phone right now. She just found out I canceled our entire wedding that was supposed to happen in 4 months. See, I own a tech consulting firm that's done pretty well. Not yacht money, but comfortable. She's an influencer making maybe 30 k a year. When we got engaged last year after dating for 3 years, she immediately went into wedding planning overdrive. Not just any wedding. Her dream wedding. Historic 8 venue for $15,000, catering for 250 guests at $30,000, flowers for $8,000, photographer and videographer for $10,000. Her dress for $12,000, live band for $6,000. The list kept going. Total damage $85,000. I was fine with it initially. I loved her, wanted her happy, had the money saved. But then my lawyer friend Garrett pulled me aside at a barbecue. Yo, you getting a prenup? Haven't thought about it. Dude, you own a business. You need one. If she's cool, no harm done. So I brought it up that night casually. Hey, Garrett mentioned we should probably do a prenup. Standard stuff for business owners. The temperature in the room dropped in. You think I'm a gold digger? Bianca snapped. No, it's just standard legal Protection. If you loved me, you'd trust me. I do trust you. This is just. I'll Sign a prenup when hell freezes over. Bianca, be reasonable. You be reasonable. We're supposed to be partners. What's yours is ours, but what's mine is. Well, you know, I don't have money like you. Don't be ridiculous. God, why are you being so cheap? She stormed off. I figured she needed time to cool down. Nope. Next day, she told her whole family I was financially abusing her by asking for a prenup. Her mom, Deedee, called, screaming, how dare you insult my daughter like this? I asked for a standard prenup. That's not an insult. She's giving you the best years of her life. She's 28, not 80. And I'm giving her mine, too. A real man doesn't need contracts with his wife. Click. She hung up on me. Bianca came back that evening, acting like nothing happened. Started showing me centerpiece options. We need to resolve the prenup thing first. I said. There's nothing to resolve. I'm not signing it now. Roses or peonies? Bianca, I'm serious. So am I. Drop it or there won't be a wedding. Okay, good. So peonies? Sure. Whatever you want. She smiled, thinking she'd won. Started talking about napkin colors and chair sashes. I smiled and nodded, but went to bed thinking. Woke up knowing exactly what I had to do the next morning. I started making calls. Not dramatic ones, just practical ones. First, a venue explained I needed to cancel due to irreconcilable differences that have emerged. They were Surprisingly cool. Apparently this happens more than you'd think. Got 60% of my deposit back since it was over 120 days out. Next tater, same story. 50% back. Photographer actually gave me 100% back because he'd already booked another wedding for that date at a higher rate. Solid dude. Band, florist, everyone one by one quietly canceled. Didn't tell Bianca. Didn't tell anyone except my best friend Marcus, who thought I was either genius or insane. Meanwhile, Bianca was in full bridezilla mode, created a wedding Instagram, posted daily about becoming Mrs. My last name, and can't wait to marry my provider. Yeah, that post told me everything I needed to know. She kept pushing about other stuff too. You know, if you drop this prenup nonsense, I might consider having your groomsmen Marcus in the wedding party. Marcus is my best friend. He's already my best man. Well, I think my cousin.

My fiance Rebecca really picked the worst time to call me paranoid about her ex, Nate. We were literally sitting there tasting wedding cakes when she brought it up. She kept insisting they were just friends now and I was being controlling. The thing was, I'd come home early from a work trip last week and saw his car leaving our apartment complex at 2:00am. She had no idea I'd seen it. Every time his name popped up on her phone, she'd flip it face down real quick. When she called me insecure again, I decided to call her bluff. You're right. I'm being unfair. Let's invite Nate to your parents anniversary dinner next week, I said. I watched all the color drain from her face. She tried to backtrack, saying her family wouldn't want extra guests at the their special dinner, but I pushed harder. I'll call him myself to show I trust you. She was trapped and we both knew it. She agreed, but her hands were literally shaking that night. I called Nate and made sure to put him on speaker so Rebecca could hear everything. I told him I wanted to apologize for being the jealous boyfriend and invited him to the family dinner. Rebecca just sat there watching me, completely stuck. He tried to turn me down, said it wasn't a good idea, but I Kept pushing, telling him Rebecca really wanted him there. I even offered to pick him up myself, you know, to show there were no hard feelings. When I picked him up that night, the guy was sweating through his dress shirt. During the drive, he mentioned Rebecca's parents hated him, but wouldn't tell me why. We walked into that dinner together, and I swear, the whole room just froze. Rebecca's mom dropped her wine glass, and it shattered all over the floor. Her Dad's face went from normal to purple in about two seconds. What is he doing here? He practically growled. I played innocent and explained I'd invited Rebecca's friend to make peace. Her sister actually laughed out loud. Friends? After what he did to her? Right then, Rebecca's phone lit up on the table. A text from Nate popped up on the screen. This was a mistake. We should be more careful. Everyone saw it. Her sister snatched the phone before Rebecca could grab it. More messages were right there on the lock screen. Meeting times. Last night was amazing. And what looked like photos being sent back and forth. Her dad jumped up so fast, his chair fell backwards. You're seeing him again. Nate was already heading for the door. Rebecca ran after him, begging him to wait. That's when her family just exploded. Her mom started telling me how Nate had cheated on Rebecca years ago with her own roommate. He'd lied about it six months. Straight. The whole family had been there for Rebecca through that nightmare of a breakup. And now she was sneaking around with him again. Two months before our wedding, Rebecca came back inside with her makeup running down her face. Her family looked at her like she was a strange. They kept telling me story after story about what Nate had put her through. How could you invite him here? Rebecca screamed at me. I stayed calm and reminded her that. She told me he was harmless. What was wrong with inviting a friend to dinner? Her family wouldn't stop listing all the terrible things Nate had done. The cheating, the constant lies, how he'd complete

So I moved across the country for my dream job. But six months later, she showed up at my door, saying, I'm ready to commit now, because distance doesn't matter when it's real love. And I laughed before introducing her to my new fiance, who was cooking dinner in our kitchen. I'm Marcus, 26, and when Jess dumped me six months ago, she said I was emotionally unavailable and socially stunted. Her exact words. You hide behind your work and can't form real connections. I need someone who actually has friends and knows how to be vulnerable. This happened right after I got accepted to my dream veterinary residency in Denver. We've been together two years, and I thought we were solid. I was planning to propose that Christmas, even had the ring picked out. The breakup destroyed me. I spent three days eating cereal in bed, questioning everything. Was I really that disconnected? Maybe she was right. Maybe I was just using her as a placeholder while focusing on my career. But I'd committed to the residency. So I packed up and drove to Denver with my clothes, textbooks, and a broken heart. If I was going to be miserable, at least I'd do something I loved. The animal hospital was this busy emergency clinic downtown. Doctor Peterson put me on 12 hour shifts immediately. I was so exhausted learning New procedures that I barely thought about. Jess. Something unexpected happened, though. My colleague Mike kept inviting me to trivia night at this time bar. I made excuses. Too tired, had studying. But Mike was persistent, and I finally gave in just to shut him up. Trivia night was actually fun. Mike's team called themselves the Possum 4 and competed against other medical professionals. I was weirdly good at Animal Facts, making me valuable for the first time in months. I was laughing and genuinely enjoying people's company. Mike introduced me to his hiking group. Outdoorsy medical people doing weekend trails around Colorado. I'd always loved nature, but never had anyone to explore with. Suddenly, I was spending Saturdays climbing mountains and having real conversations with people who weren't. Just then I started volunteering at the city animal shelter on days off. They needed someone with medical training for health assessments. That's where I met Diana. She was the shelter coordinator, this amazing woman who knew every single animal's personality and history. She'd work late with difficult rescue cases, and I started staying to help with medical check UPS. We talk for hours about each animal's progress and recovery stories. Diana had this gift for seeing potential in every broken creature. She was patient, compassionate, incredibly smart about animal behavior. Three months later, we went on our first date to a dog friendly brewery where half our shelter animals had been adopted. We spent the evening pointing out our kids And discussing dreams of opening our own rescue. Focused practice with Diana. Conversation felt effortless. We could talk about work, family, random thoughts. Everything flowed naturally. I'd never experienced that easy connection, even with Jess. Diana actually listened when I talked about cases. Last month, I proposed at the same dog park where we had our first date. I brought three shelter dogs, each wearing part of the message on their collars. Diana cried and said yes before I could even kneel. We moved in together two weeks ago into this cute apartment walking distance from both the hospital and shelter. Diana cooks most nights, since my schedule is insane, and I help with adoption paperwork and medical evaluations. Yesterday, coming home from a brutal shift, I saw someone on our apartment steps.

I took in a foster kid for a quick paycheck. I know how that sounds, but hear me out. Theo was 17 and had been returned by 14 families. I was broke and needed money to pay for my wife's early alzheimer's. Our bio son, Jaden, had been in prison for statutory rape, so it's not like we had other responsibilities. Theo moved in on a Thursday afternoon with one garbage bag of belongings and eyes that dared me to reject him. I showed him Jaden's old room, rattling off the rules like terms of a lease. He nodded once and disappeared behind the door. For weeks, we were just strangers sharing walls. He'd leave before my 5:00am alarm, and I'd come home at nine PM to find him already locked away, only the thin line of light under his door proving he existed. One afternoon, I heard the Arctic Monkeys blasting through his headphones while I made coffee. I told him it was my favorite band and we the music from Alexa instead. When I went grocery shopping, I picked up his favorite Celsius flavor without being asked. We developed a perfect rhythm without needing to talk. By month three, he knew me better than most of my coworkers. He'd replace my coffee pods before it ran out, so I'd make extra portions of dinner for when he felt like snacking. Almost like a real Family. If you squint. Then I got the call. You need to come get your wife. She's crazy. I found rose two blocks away in her thin nightgown, bare feet bleeding on the concrete. When I tried to wrap my jacket around her, she clawed at my face. Don't touch me! Where's my son? What did you do with my son? My heart shattered. The emts arrived and tried to grab her arms, but she fought harder, animal sounds coming from her throat I'd never heard before. That's when Theo appeared from the darkness. Fill in yesterday's clothes like he'd been awake all night. He started humming something I didn't recognize. Low and steady, like a heartbeat. Rose's whole body changed. The wild fear drained from her face as she turned toward the sound. My baby, she whispered, reaching out with shaking hands. You came back to me. Theo kept humming while walking closer, palms out where she could see them, moving like water. It's okay, missus K, he said in this soft voice I'd never heard. Like he'd done this before. Wanna go home? I'll make you tea. She grabbed his hand like a lifeline. The EMTs let him ride in the ambulance. He sat next to her gurney, thumb tracing circles on her palm, humming whenever her breathing quickened. By the time we hit the ER, she was calm enough. They skipped the restraints. The doctor pulled me aside near the vending machines, his voice low. If that Kid hadn't calmed her down, we would have been forced to put her in an involuntary hold. I turned to look at Theo, but he didn't say anything. Instead, he pulled out the spiral notebook I'd always seen him carrying. As he. I flipped through, my heart throbbed. Each page was filled with documentation on my wife's progress. All those mornings I'd found her peaceful in bed, thinking the new meds were working. It was him. We brought rose home as the sun came up. I went to make coffee, hands still shaking, and noticed the kitchen trash overflowing. I pulled the bag out and envelope spilled everywhere. M I T, Stanford, Burk play. All college acceptances. All dated exactly three months ago. Right when her night terrors started. They were too far from here, was all he said when I asked. That's when I knew this kid wasn't placement anymore. He was family. A week later, my phone rang. Jade

My best friend Ford had the craziest parents. Last year, when he got an 89 on a pre test, they completely lost it. They blamed his social life and said, you're not allowed to take one step out of this house except for school. No exceptions. And they weren't kidding. He literally wasn't allowed to go to birthday parties, field trips, or even study groups. Saying, your friends are distractions. From now on, you focus only on academics. I tried to convince them that none of those things were a distraction, but they refused to listen. So when I handed Ford an invitation to my birthday, he handed it back with a deep frown. Sorry. You know, they'd never let me go. The whole not a single, single step out of this house rule, remember? But that's when my friend Logan had an idea. Then let's just carry you out. We stared at him, thinking it was the most ridiculous thing we'd heard. But when you fight crazy with crazier. Well, it was worth a shot. So we showed up to Ford's door for the first time with our first attempt, a rolling office chair. I rang the doorbell and took a deep breath. Good afternoon. Ford's wonderful parents need Ford for a group project. Oh, no. He strictly can't take one step out of the house. Yes, we know. So he won't. Ford grinned, seeing Us through the doorway and quickly leapt onto the office chair. He'll be in this seat the entire time. Not one step. Ford's parents stared like it was the stupidest thing they'd ever heard. But they couldn't exactly argue against it, either. So Ford rolled all the way to my birthday party. The next time we showed up, his mom instantly said, no rolling chairs allowed. Logan shrugged. Already prepared. Two other guys popped out from the bushes and helped us literally carry Ford out on our shoulders, like they do in funerals, but without the CAS. Get. You said he can't leave. We're removing him. That's the same thing, she argued. No, no. This is involuntary relocation. We kept switching up tactics. Every time, a new part of the rule got added. Can't exit the house through any doorway. We brought a ladder to his window and transported him away with a shopping cart. Can't leave without a chaperone. We printed out a cardboard cut out of his dad and carried that around, too. At some point, Ford managed to leave the house to go bowling with us just by dressing up in a costume and saying, well, I'm not Ford right now. I'm Iron Man. Unfortunately, that was the final straw. After his last stunt, Ford got completely grounded. No door, no phone, no anything. It's over. They won, I said, feeling down that he wasn't even able to go to the class's end of the year party. But Logan wasn't ready to give up. Logan gathered everyone and said, if Ford can't leave, I say we bring the party to Ford. Everyone cheered at the idea, and honestly, it was the best one he had yet. So that Saturday night, 30 of us showed up at once, carrying around our world history textbooks. Study group. Ford answered the door with a shocked expression. My parents just stepped out. What are you guys doing here? We grinned. Welcome to the end of the year party, bro. We instantly set up for the party. Disco ball hanging from the living room ceiling fan, set up a small DJ counter in the kitchen, and pulled out all the food and snacks.

I played innocent and explained I'd invited Rebecca's friend to make peace. Her sister actually laughed out loud. Friends? After what he did to her? Right then, Rebecca's phone lit up on the table. A text from Nate popped up on the screen. This was a mistake. We should be more careful. Everyone saw it. Her sister snatched the phone before Rebecca could grab it. More messages were right there on the lock screen. Meeting time last night was amazing. And what looked like photos being sent back and forth. Her dad jumped up so fast, his chair fell backwards. You're seeing him again. Nate was already heading for the door. Rebecca ran after him, begging him to wait. That's when her family just exploded. Her mom started telling me how Nate had cheated. Did. On Rebecca years ago with her own roommate. He'd lied about it for Six months straight, the whole family had been there for Rebecca through that nightmare of a breakup. And now she was sneaking around with him again. Two months before our wedding, Rebecca came back inside with her makeup running down her face. Her family looked at her like she was a stranger. They kept telling me story after story about what Nate had put her through. How could you

Four years later, I found them in our bed three days before our wedding. My fiance Jessica, and her stepbrother, Braden. She didn't even try to explain. Just looked at me and said, I love him. Her engagement ring was still on. While she held his hand, Braden smirked. Sorry, man. It just happened. Their parents had married two years ago. At night, Jessica posted photos with Braden like nothing happened. Changed her relationship status. While our wedding vendors were still calling me. I had to cancel everything alone. The venue, the flowers, the honeymoon. Each call was humiliation. The hotel manager asked, if is the bride okay? I couldn't even answer. But I turned that rage into purpose. Studied for the bar exam like my life depended on it. Passed first try. Got hired as a paralegal at a family law firm. My job? Research custody cases and find evidence. My boss said I had unusual drive. I had unusual motivation. While I Learned every detail about custody battles and what makes a parent unfit. Jessica and Braden played house. A daughter posted family photos online. Their parents barely visited, but they insisted their love was worth it. I became the firm's best researcher. The paralegal who found evidence that won cases. Lawyers requested me for their hardest custody battles. I knew exactly what judges looked for, what evidence mattered, how to prove someone was lying about being A good parent. Three years in, I was the go to person for impossible cases. I turned my pain into expert peace. While Jessica and Braden raised their daughter, I became an expert at determining who deserved to keep their kids. Life has a strange sense of humor. Four years later, Braden walked into my firm. I was in the conference room, and I heard his voice at reception, desperate, explaining how Jessica wanted full custody of their daughter. My boss knocked. Can you handle this case? Do the research? I almost said no. Then curiosity one. Braden looked destroyed. Didn't recognize me at first. I changed. Lost weight, expensive suit, different hairstyle. He was too focused on his problem. She's saying I'm an unfit father, that our relationship was wrong from the start. Then he really looked at me. His face went white. Your. Oh, god. Started to leave, but my boss insisted. Please sit. We're here to help. Braden slumped back down, kept glancing at me while explaining Jessica had cheated with her trainer, now wanted their daughter. Was telling the court Braden wasn't a good father, that their relationship had been unhealthy. The irony was perfect. She'd left me for him. Now she was leaving him and trying to take their child. My boss assured Braden, we take the case. Braden didn't realize I'd be building the entire case, finding every piece of evidence that would determine if he kept his daughter. I spent three weeks investigating Found Jessica's texts to friends bragging about her trainer. Discovered she'd been leaving their daughter with babysitters constantly. Located witnesses who saw Braden at every school event while Jessica was at the gym. Built a file proving who the real parent was. At the custody hearing, I sat at the lawyer's table organizing evidence. Jessica walked in confident until

My mom clinked her fork against her glass and stood up. Before we sing Happy Birthday to my daughter, I want everyone to know we're also celebrating Moira's half birthday today. My 16 year old sister Moira bounced up from her chair and rushed to stand behind my birthday cake, giggling. Another birthday stolen right in front of me. It's my 18th birthday, I said. Can I have just this one birthday for myself? Mom stared daggers at me. Don't be selfish. Birthdays are meant for sharing, and we do this every year. Dad added. Why are you suddenly making it a problem? But that was exactly the problem. Every year I had to deal with my parents putting Moira first. And sure, it was cute back when Moira was three and I was five. I mean, who wouldn't say all when your toddler sister helps blow out your candles for the first time? But that was the thing. We were kids. But that cute incident didn't stop there. During Christmas, my parents let her tear open her gifts first before turning around and opening mine, too. You're too old to be excited with opening presents anyway, mom said. I was 8. My 10th birthday dinner was at Chuck E. Cheese instead of the Japanese restaurant I wanted. All because Moira threw a tantrum about wanting pizza. My 12th birthday got canceled when Moira woke up with a really bad Tummy ache. Which happened to suddenly disappear an hour after telling everyone not to show up. And on my 16th birthday, my parents forgot all about it. So this year was really it. I was an adult and didn't have to put up with their crap any longer. I looked down at my birthday cake, with Moira's name written beautifully and mine squeezed into the bottom corner in sloppy letters, completely misspelt, and just lost it. Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday, dear! I blew out the candles right there. Every single one. Before Moira could make her move, the singing instantly fell apart. Every person in the room went completely silent. What the heck? Moira shrieked. Why did you blow out my cake? Our cake! I said with a smile. I grabbed the presents my parents neatly wrapped on the side for my sister and ripped open the first box. AirPods! Wow! I've been asking for this for four years! Those are Moira's half birthday presents. Mom stood up so fast, her chair scraped against the floor. Exactly. I can't wait to share it. I opened another box. Oh, A Lululemon gift card! Thanks so much! I carefully opened the rest of my gifts, making snarky comments like, oh, Moira! This isn't the color Moira likes. Guess I'll just keep it for myself. You don't mind, right, Moira? All the guests stared at her. Moira started crying, real tears streaming down her face. She's ruining everything! Make her stop! This is what we always do, I said, staying perfectly calm. I don't understand why you're upset. Dad's face turned red. You're going too far. This is cruel. Too far? I looked at him. This is exactly what happens at every birthday of mine. The only difference is I'm not allowed to cry about it. Mom's voice cracked, horrified by the sudden public exposure. You're older, you should know better. So when I was five and she was three, I should have known better? You're ruining her special moment, dad said, grabbing the AirPods out of my hands. Her special moment! I burst out into laughter, pointing to the. Hey, this is my birthday! Moira is quite literally 4 months away. Funny how all this sharing stuff only applies when it's my birthday. I mean, go ahead, name one time Moira had to share her party. No

Mason threw industrial cleaning solution in my mother's face during what was supposed to be my college graduation dinner. The restaurant erupted into absolute chaos as my mother collapsed, screaming while her skin literally bubbled and peeled away from her skull. I couldn't move, couldn't breathe, couldn't comprehend what Mason had just done. My father tackled him to the ground, punching him repeatedly. I wanted to scream, but my throat wouldn't work as I watched my mother's face dissolve. He's been stealing Beatrice's identity for three years, Mason shouted while trying to shield himself from my father's fists as two of my uncles jumped in to help restrain him, all of them slipping in, the blood spreading across the floor. She's been using their identical resemblance to drain her bank accounts. I was barely listening. My legs gave out and I crashed into a chair. But my father hesitated for just a second, his fist raised in the air, and Mason spit blood onto the floor while my mother rolled and thrashed, knocking over chairs and leaving smears of flesh on everything she touched. I have video of her at five different banks, he yelled over my mother's inhuman screaming, holding the screen up while my uncle twisted his arm. I noticed discrepancies in Beatrice's accounts when we were apartment hunting and installed tracking software. And I've caught her mother stealing $40,000. My mother writhed on the floor and tried to speak. But only managed to spray blood across the white tablecloth while her face continued to dissolve. And even through the destroyed flesh, I could see something in that look that made my stomach drop. Because it wasn't Niall. It was rage at being caught. Those accounts are family money! She finally shrieked through her melted mouth the words. Barely human mom, I whispered, but I couldn't hear my own voice over the chaos of people screaming and crying and calling 9 1 1, while my mother's face kept bubbling and peeling like plastic in a fire. My father grabbed the phone from Mason with hands covered in my mother's blood and skin, staring at the screen where my mother was clearly at an ATM wearing my clothes, and his face went white. Linda, you've been stealing from our daughter? He asked while she convulsed on the floor, her screaming never stopping. She owes me everything! My mother managed to hiss between streaks of agony, blood and tissue dripping onto the floor. I gave up my career to raise her. The other diners were pressed against the walls, filming everything, while the manager was vomiting in the corner and servers were sobbing. And I felt like I was drowning because my own mother had been systematically destroying my future while her face was literally falling off in front of me. You destroy her face over money! My father shouted at Mason, releasing him and stumbling backward, slipping in the puddle of Blood and chemicals. Even if she stole from Beatrice, you threw acid at my wife. Mason wiped blood from his broken nose and looked directly at me with an expression that made my blood freeze. That's not why I had to destroy her face. Everyone went silent except for my mother's whimpering and the sound of her skin sizzling, and I heard myself ask, what do you mean? That's not why I followed her to a P O. Box yesterday, Mason said quietly. Check her purse. My mother started, shrieking even louder and trying to crawl toward her bag, leaving a trail of dissolved flesh. But my father got there first and dumped it onto the floor, where a small glass vial rolled out. That's Wrayson, Mason said, his voice deadly calm.

So I moved across the country for my dream job. But six months later, she showed up at my door, saying, I'm ready to commit now, because distance doesn't matter when it's real love. And I laughed before introducing her to my new fiance, who was cooking dinner in our kitchen. I'm Marcus, 26, and when Jess dumped me six months ago, she said I was emotionally unavailable and socially stunted. Her exact words. You hide behind your work and can't form real connections. I need someone who actually has friends and knows how to be vulnerable. This happened right after I got accepted to my dream veterinary residency in Denver. We've been together two years, and I thought we were solid. I was planning to propose that Christmas, even had the ring picked out. The breakup destroyed me. I spent three days eating cereal in bed, questioning everything. Was I really that disconnected? Maybe she was right. Maybe I was just using her as a placeholder while focusing on my career. But I'd committed to the residency. So I packed up and drove to Denver with just my clothes, textbook, and a broken heart. If I was going to be miserable, at least I'd do something I loved. The animal hospital was this busy emergency clinic downtown. Doctor Peterson put me on 12 hour Shifts immediately. I was so exhausted learning new procedures that I barely thought about Jess. Something unexpected happened, though. My colleague Mike kept inviting me to trivia night at this dive bar. I made excuses. Too tired, had studying. But Mike was persistent, and I finally gave in just to shut him up. Trivia night was actually fun. Mike's team called themselves the Possum 4 and competed against other medical professionals. I was weirdly good at Animal Facts, making me valuable for the first time in months. I was laughing and genuinely enjoying people's company. Mike introduced me to his hiking group. Outdoorsy medical people doing weekend trails around Colorado. I'd always loved nature, but never had anyone to explore with. Suddenly, I was spending Saturdays climbing mountains and having real conversations with people who weren't. Just then I started volunteering at the city animal shelter on days off. They needed someone with medical training for health assessments. That's where I met Diana. She was the shelter coordinator, this amazing woman who knew every single animal's personality and history. She'd work late with difficult rescue cases, and I started staying to help with medical check UPS. We talked for hours about each animal's progress and recovery stories. Diana had this gift for seeing potential in every broken creature. She was patient, compassionate, incredibly smart about animal behavior. Three months later, we went on our first date to a dog friendly brewery where half our shelter animals had been adopted. We Spent the evening pointing out our kids and discussing dreams of opening our own rescue. Focused practice with Diana. Conversation felt effortless. We could talk about work, family, random thoughts. Everything flowed naturally. I'd never experienced that easy connection, even with Jess. Diana actually listened when I talked about cases. Last month, I proposed at the same dog park where we had our first date. I brought three shelter dogs, each wearing part of the message on their collars. Diana cried and said yes before

So I've been helping my older sister Brisa, plan her wedding since the day she got engaged. We're talking eight months of venue tours, cake tastings, and color swatching. Every shade of lush pink known to mankind. She called me her angel sister to everyone, bragging about how she couldn't imagine doing any of this without me. We spent every Sunday together working on centerpieces, addressing invitations, making those little favor bag. Never once did we argue about anything. Then, two weeks before her big day, we're at the final bridesmaid dress fitting downtown. I step out of the dressing room in this dusty rose dress she picked, and I watch her face just completely change. She goes quiet for the rest of the appointment, barely looks at me. That night, I'm meal prepping for the week when my phone rings. We need to talk about the wedding, she says, and her voice is ice cold. I'm thinking maybe there's a vendor issue or something. Then she hits me with, you're out of the wedding party. Actually, don't even come to the wedding at all. She tells me I looked too good in the bridesmaid dress, and she won't have me stealing attention on her special day. I literally laughed because I thought she was joking. We're sisters. I offered to wear a different dress, do my hair different, wear less makeup. Literally anything. But she's Dead serious. This is my wedding and my day. I don't want you there. I could have fought her on it. Could have called our parents, made it into this whole family drama. But honestly, if she really felt that threatened by me just existing in a bridesmaid dress, then fine. I told her, okay, if that's what you want. She sounded surprised, like she expected me to beg or cry or something. That night, I started going through all my emails. Every vendor communication is in my inbox because I'm the one who's been handling everything. The venue, that's my boss's country club, and he gave us the friends and family discount. The florist, she's a client from my job. The photographer, charging $2,000 instead of his usual six thousand dollars. I designed his entire website portfolio for free last year. The caterer, the DJ, the bartenders, even the hair and makeup team. They're all doing this as favors to me, not her. My sister has no idea that every single contract is technically under my name. The next morning, I called Brisa one more time. Just so you know, if I'm not part of the wedding, I'll need to cancel all the arrangements I made through my connections. She immediately snaps back, good, I don't want anything from you. Anyway, she hung up before I could say anything. I don't think she had any clue what that meant. I spent the rest of that day making calls. First The venue. I explained that I won't be attending the wedding anymore, so I need to cancel the reservation I made. My boss is confused but says no problem. Next. The florist. She's actually offended when I tell her what happened and says she wouldn't work with my sister now even if she begged. The photographer is booked solid and happily takes another wedding for that date at his full rate. One by one, I cancel everything. The caterer, the DJ, the Baker who was doing a five tier for the price of three. I also canceled the two surprises I planned as a gift. I've been secretly paying for the premium open bar package and upgraded their honeymoon suite to the penthouse.

Growing up, my dad had one phrase that he loved. My house, my rules. When I was 16 and wanted to dye my hair purple for junior year, he stood in the bathroom doorway, blocking my path. Not under my roof, Alexis. You want purple hair, get your own place. When my boyfriend asked me to prom, dad made him sit through a two hour interrogation before declaring, no dating until you're 18. My house, my rules. I couldn't even watch P G. 13 movies until. Till I was 17 because inappropriate content isn't welcome under my roof. My friends stopped coming over after dad made them sign a behavioral contract to enter our home. He controlled what I wore. No ripped jeans in my house. You look homeless. What I ate. Vegetarian phase. Not at my dinner table. And my opinions, too. You don't get to disagree with me while you're living rent free. When I got accepted to art school, he laughed. Art degree? Not with my money. You'll study business or nothing. Mom would whisper apologies when he wasn't looking, but never stood up to him. The worst part was his favorite closing line whenever I protested. When you have your own place, you can do whatever you want. Don't like it? There's the door. He'd literally point to the front door, knowing I had nowhere to go. At 17, with $82 in My saving account. Life isn't fair, Princess. The person who pays the bills makes the rules. Remember that. Well, I took student loans and went to art school anyway, living in a studio apartment with three roommates and a family of roaches. Dad called it learning life a hard way. Should have listened to me about that business degree, he'd say during Sunday dinners while I was building my graphic design portfolio at 3 a m. Dad was getting comfortable in early retirement at 55, spending his days watching Fox News and calling me to criticize my lifestyle choices. Still living in that dump? He'd ask. Still single because you're too picky? Still wasting time on those computer drawings? His words hurt, but I kept going. Meanwhile, his perfect life started cracking. Mom finally left him after 30 years, tired of the controlling behavior. She's going through menopause, he told everyone, refusing to admit she'd simply had enough. Then his health declined, and he got diabetes from decades of my house, my beer choices. He even refused to take his medications properly because no doctor tells me what to do in my own home. Next, his house started falling apart, with the roof leaking and the foundation cracking. But he was too proud to ask for help and too cheap to hire anyone. I built this house. I'll maintain it my way. By the time I landed my senior design director position, making six figures at 29, Dad was 67 Living alone in a deteriorating house, alienated from most family members and struggling with basic tasks, but still preaching about his rules whenever anyone would listen. Then one day, my phone rang and his name popped up. Alexis. How's my successful daughter? Red Flag already? He never spoke that nicely. What do you need, dad? Can't a father call his daughter? You only call when you want something. Long pause. The house is getting to be too much. Your mother used to handle things, but now she's gone. I was thinking maybe I could stay with you for a while. I knew this was coming. He'd been posting on Facebook about his struggles, fishing for sympathy. But I wasn't going to just refuse because I had a secret plan. So I told him, of course you can stay with me. Dad. I have a sweet. His voice brightened immediately. Good. It's your duty as my daughter. I almost burst out laughing. Sure, dad, but I need to explain the house rules. What rules? Well, my house, my rules, remember? His voice turned sour immediately. Alexis, you can't be serious. Dead serious. First, visiting hours are 10 a m. To 8 p m. I work from home and need quiet. No Fox News. It's too negative for my workspace. Breakfast is at 7, lunch at noon, dinner at 6. Bedtime is 9 p m. Because I don't want to hear T V. After that, I heard his voice crack, and he Became super angry. This is ridiculous! You can't impose rules on me.

My best friend Ford had the craziest parents. Last year, when he got an 89 on a pre test, they completely lost it. They blamed his social life and said, you're not allowed to take one step out of this house except for school. No exceptions. And they weren't kidding. He literally wasn't allowed to go to birthday parties, field trips, or even study groups. Saying, your friends are distractions. From now on, you focus only on academics. I tried to convince them that none of those things were a distraction, but they refused to listen. So when I handed Ford an invitation to my birthday, he handed it back with a deep frown. Sorry. You know, they'd never let me go. The whole not a single step out of this house rule, remember? But that's when my friend Logan had an idea. Then let's just carry you out. We stared at him, thinking it was the most ridiculous thing we'd heard. But when you fight crazy with crazier. Well, it was worth a shot. So we showed up to Ford's door for the first time with our first attempt, a rolling office chair. I rang the doorbell and took a deep breath. Good afternoon, Ford's wonderful parents. I need Ford for a group project. Oh, no. He strictly can't take one step out of the house. Yes, we know. So he won't. Ford grinned, seeing Us through the doorway and quickly leapt onto the office chair. He'll be in this seat the entire time. Not one step. Ford's parents stared like it was the stupidest thing they'd ever heard. But they couldn't exactly argue against it, either. So Ford rolled all the way to my birthday party. The next time we showed up, his mom instantly said, no rolling chairs allowed. Logan shrugged. Already prepared. Two other guys popped out from the bushes and helped us literally carry Ford out on our shoulders, like they do in funerals, but without the casket. You said he can't leave. We're removing him. That's the same thing, she argued. No, no. This is involuntary relocation. We kept switching up tactics. Every time, a new part of the rule got added. Can't exit the house through any doorway. We brought a ladder to his window and transported him away with a shopping cart. Can't leave without a chaperone. I printed out a cardboard cut out of his dad and carried that around, too. At some point, Ford managed to leave the house to go bowling with us just by dressing up in a costume and saying, well, I'm not Ford right now. I'm Iron Man. Unfortunately, that was the final straw. After his last stunt, Ford got completely grounded. No door, no phone, no anything. It's over. They won, I said, feeling down that he wasn't even able to go to the class. This is end of the year. Party! But Logan wasn't ready to give up. Logan gathered everyone and said, if Ford can't leave, I say we bring the party to Ford. Everyone cheered at the idea, and honestly, it was the best one he had yet. So that Saturday night, 30 of us showed up at once, carrying around our world history textbooks. Study group. Ford answered the door with a shocked expression. My parents just stepped out. What are you guys doing here? We grinned. Welcome to the end of the year party, bro. We instantly set up for the party. Disco ball hanging from the living room ceiling fan. Set up a small DJ counter in the kitchen and pulled out all the food and snack. Next in the fridge and pantry. The entire house became a party. Kids were dancing while holding textbooks. Someone started a conga line through the kitchen. The base was shaking family photos off the walls. When Ford's parents got back home, their faces drained of color, instantly watching a bunch of kids go wild.

I knew dating Rachel meant getting past her three older brothers, but I had no idea they'd turned protecting her into a military operation. She'd been with a guy named Jeff for two years, and he'd broken her jaw when she tried to leave him. So now her brothers treated every man who looked at her like a potential threat. The first time I picked her up for dinner, her oldest brother answered the door holding a baseball bat like he was stepping up to home plate. The middle brother stood behind him, cracking his knuckles, while the youngest just stared at me, taking photos with his phone, probably for some criminal database they were building. Rachel pushed past them, looking mortified, but I caught the oldest one mouthing, we're watching you. As we walked to my car. They threw literally everything at me to see if I'd crack or run away screaming. Every restaurant we went to, somehow one brother would already be there, pretending to read a menu upside down while photographing my every move. During our third date, the youngest brother actually sat down at our table uninvited and said, so what exactly are your intentions with our sister? Because we've got shovels, and we know how to use them. Instead of getting angry, I looked him straight in the eye and said, my intention is to never give you a reason to Use them, which made him blink first. They ran background checks and left the results on my windshield with certain thing circled in red marker like a teacher grading papers. The middle brother created a fake Instagram profile as a woman named Jessica and sent me messages trying to get me to cheat, but I just screenshot everything and sent them to Rachel saying, your brother needs to work on his catfishing skills because Jessica types exactly like him. When they followed us to the movies, I bought them popcorn and had the usher deliver it to their seats with a note saying next time just join us instead of lurking, which actually made the youngest one laugh. I started leaving gift cards for coffee on their trucks. I spotted them tailing us with notes like stalking must be exhausting, so caffeine's on me, and eventually the oldest brother actually used one. The breakthrough came when I showed up at their mother's birthday even though Rachel warned me they'd told me the wrong time on purpose. I arrived three hours early with flowers for their mom and helped her cook while she told me embarrassing stories about all four of her kids. By the time everyone else arrived, I was wearing her apron and knew about the time the oldest brother cried watching The Lion King at age 16. He pulled me aside later and said that was sneaky as hell, but he was almost smiling when he said It. After two months of this dance, where I matched every test with patience and humor, the middle brother finally asked me directly, why haven't you given up yet? We've broken seven guys before you. I told him the truth. That Rachel was worth whatever bizarre hazing ritual they needed to put me through. The real test came during Rachel's company holiday party, when I stepped outside for air and found all three brothers waiting by my car. The oldest one stepped forward and said, she's getting attached, and we need to know if you're going to hurt her. Before I could answer, we heard Rachel scream from the parking garage and saw her backing away from a man I recognized from photos as Jeff, who'd been released early for good behavior.

My mom clinked her fork against her glass and stood up. Before we sing Happy Birthday to my daughter, I want everyone to know we're also celebrating Moira's half birthday today. My 16 year old sister Moira bounced up from her chair and rushed to stand behind my birthday cake, giggling. Another birthday stolen right in front of me. It's my 18th birthday, I said. Can I have just this one birthday for myself? Mom stared daggers at me. Don't be selfish. Birthdays are meant for sharing, and we do this every year. Dad added, why are you suddenly making it a problem? But that was exactly the problem. Every year I had to deal with my parents putting Moira first. And sure, it was cute back when Moira was three and I was five. I mean, who wouldn't say all when your toddler sister helps blow out your candles for the first time? But that was the thing. We were kids. But that cute incident didn't stop there. During Christmas, my parents let her tear open her gifts first before turning around and opening mine too. You're too old to be excited with opening presents anyway, mom said. I was 8. My 10th birthday dinner was at Chuck E. Cheese instead of the Japanese restaurant I wanted. All because Moira threw a tantrum about wanting pizza. My 12th birthday got canceled when Moira woke up with a really bad tummy. Ache which happened to suddenly disappear an hour after telling everyone not to show up. And on my 16th birthday, my parents forgot all about it. So this year was really it. I was an adult and didn't have to put up with their crap any longer. I looked down at my birthday cake, with Moira's name written beautifully and mine squeezed into the bottom corner in sloppy letters, completely misspelled, and just lost it. Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday, dear! I blew out the candles right there. Every single one. Before Moira could make her move, the singing instantly fell apart. Every person in the room went completely silent. What the heck? Moira shrieked. Why'd you blow out my cake? Our cake! I said with a smile. I grabbed the presents my parents neatly wrapped on the side for my sister and ripped open the first box. AirPods! Wow! I've been asking for this for four years! Those are Moira's half birthday presents. Mom stood up so fast, her chair scraped against the floor. Exactly! I can't wait to share it. I opened another box. Ooh, a Lululemon gift card! Thanks so much! I carefully opened the rest of my gifts, making snarky comments like, oh, Moira, this isn't the color Moira likes. Guess I'll just keep it for myself. You don't mind, right, Moira? All the guests stared at her. Moira started crying, real tears streaming down her face. She's ruining everything! Make her stop! This is What we always do. I said. Stay perfectly calm. I don't understand why you're upset. Dad's face turned red. You're going too far. This is cruel. Too far? I looked at him. This is exactly what happens at every birthday of mine. The only difference is I'm not allowed to cry about it. Mom's voice cracked, horrified by the sudden public exposure. You're older. You should know better. So when I was five and she was three, I should have known better? You're ruining her special moment, dad said, grabbing the AirPods out of my hands. Her special moment? I burst out into laughter, pointing to the cake. This is my birthday. Moira is quite literally four months away. Funny how all this sharing stuff only applies when it's my birthday. I mean, go ahead. And one time Moira had to share her party. Nothing. Complete silence. Yeah, that's what I thought. Last year, her Sweet 16 had a professional photographer. The year before, you rented the country club. Before that, the pool party with a DJ. When has she ever had to share? I grabbed a cake cutter and started slicing up pieces and placing them on paper plates to hand out to guests.

I said, fair enough, and quietly canceled our 85,000 dollar wedding. Her face went pale when she got the cancellation notice. I'm watching my ex fiance Bianca blow up my phone right now. She just found out I canceled our entire wedding that was supposed to happen in 4 months. See, I own a tech consulting firm that's done pretty well. Not yacht money, but comfortable. She's an influencer making maybe 30 k a year. When we got engaged last year after dating for three years, she immediately went into wedding planning overdrive. Not just any wedding. Her dream wedding. Historic estate venue for $15,000. Catering for 250 guests at $30,000. Flowers for $8,000. Photographer and videographer for $10,000. Her dress for $12,000. Live band for $6,000. The list kept going. Total damage 80 $5,000. I was fine with it initially. I loved her, wanted her happy, had the money saved. But then my lawyer friend Garrett pulled me aside at a barbecue. Yo, you getting a prenup? Haven't thought about it. Dude, you own a business. You need one. If she's cool, no harm done. So I brought it up that night casually. Hey, Garrett mentioned we should probably do a prenup. Standard stuff for business owners. The temperature in the room dropped in. You think I'm a gold digger? Bianca snapped. No, it's just standard legal Protection. If you loved me, you'd trust me. I do trust You. This is just. I'll sign a prenup when hell freezes over. Bianca, be reasonable. You be reasonable. We're supposed to be partners. What's yours is ours, but what's mine is. Well, you know, I don't have money like you. Don't be ridiculous. God, why are you being so cheap? Stormed off. I figured she needed time to cool down. Nope. Next day, she told her whole family I was financially abusing her by asking for a prenup. Her mom, Deedee, called, screaming, how dare you insult my daughter like this? I asked for a standard prenup. That's not an insult. She's giving you the best years of her life. She's 28, not 80. And I'm giving her mine, too. A real man doesn't need contracts with his wife. Click. She hung up on me. Bianca came back that evening, acting like nothing happened. Started showing me centerpiece options. We need to resolve the prenup thing first. I said. There's nothing to resolve. I'm not signing it now. Roses or peonies? Bianca, I'm serious. So am I. Drop it or there won't be a wedding. Okay, good. So, peonies? Sure, whatever you want. She smiled, thinking she'd won. Started talking about napkin colors and chair sashes. I smiled and nodded, but went bed thinking. Woke up knowing exactly what I had to do the next morning. I started making calls. Not dramatic ones, just practical ones. First, the venue explained I needed to cancel due to irreconcilable differences that have Emerged. They were surprisingly cool. Apparently this happens more than you'd think. Got 60% of my deposit back since it was over 120 days out. Next, the caterer. Same story. 50% back. Photographer actually gave me 100% back because he'd already booked another wedding for that date at a higher rate. Solid dude. Bam and florist. Everyone one by one, quietly canceled. Didn't tell Bianca. Didn't tell anyone except my best friend Marcus, who thought I was either genius or insane. Meanwhile, Bianca was in full bridezilla mode. Created a wedding Instagram, posted daily about becoming Mrs. My last name, and can't wait to marry my provider. Yeah, that post told me everything.

So I was living with this girl, Megan, who I thought was my friend. We'd known each other since freshman year. And when she said she found this perfect apartment and wanted me to sign the lease with her, I jumped at it. Five months of splitting everything, 50 50, doing dishes like good little roommates, never fighting over anything. Then one random Tuesday, I get this text while I'm at my job at the campus bookstore. Hey, we need to talk when you get home. That's never good, right? So I'm driving back thinking maybe she wants to talk about whose turn it is to buy toilet paper or something stupid like that. But when I walk in, she's sitting on our couch with this weird serious face she starts with. So I've been thinking and I already know I'm screwed. She tells me she doesn't think living together is working out and that she already talked to our landlord about me moving out by January 1st. I'm just sitting there like, what the hell? Because we literally never fought. I paid my half of everything on time. I cleaned up after myself and I even bought all the good stuff for our place. But she's acting like I'm some nightmare roommate who's been making her life miserable. I don't argue because honestly, why would I want to live with someone who doesn't want me there? So I tell her, fine, I'll start looking for a new place. She seems relieved like she was expecting me to throw a fit or something. That night I'm lying in bed thinking about how I need to pack everything and that's when it hits me. I look around our apartment and realize I bought literally everything that makes it nice. 50 inch TV mounted on the wall. Mine, the leather couch were always watching Netflix on. I saved up three paychecks for that thing. The coffee maker, the good plates instead of paper ones, the router for our internet, even the freaking shower curtain. Next morning I tell Megan I'll be taking all my stuff when I move out. She just says, okay, like it's no big deal. I don't think she really thought about what that meant. I spent the next two weeks apartment hunting and found this decent one bedroom across town. On moving day, I rented one of those big U Haul trucks because I knew I'd need it. Megan wasn't even home, which was probably for the best. I started with the obvious stuff like my clothes and my desk. Then I unplugged the TV and carefully took it down from the wall. I wrapped up the coffee maker, packed all the dishes I'd bought from target and loaded the couch onto the truck with help from my buddy Jake. The router was the last thing I grabbed. I unpacked all the Ethernet cables and took The whole setup. As I'm walking out with it, I realised she's going to have zero internet until she gets her own. But here's the thing that really made me laugh. When I was packing up the kitchen stuff, I realised I'd bought all the cooking supplies too, the pans, the good knife set, even the can opener. I left her with basically nothing except a mini fridge and some random cups she had from high school. By the time I finished loading everything, the apartment looked like nobody had ever lived there, just empty rooms with some random junk scattered around that wasn't worth taking. I drive to my new place. Feeling pretty good about myself. I'm unpacking when my phone starts blowing up. First it's texts, then calls. Megan is absolutely losing it. What the hell did you do to the apartment? She screams. When I finally pick up, it's completely empty. I tell her calmly that I took everything I paid for, just like I said I would. She she starts yelling about how she looks like an idiot because her friends were supposed to come over that night and now there's nowhere to sit and nothing to watch. You can't just take everything, she says. How am I supposed to explain this? I remind her that she literally said okay when I told her I was taking my stuff. She hangs up on me.

But she didn't know I'd had a vasectomy last year. When Amanda told me she was pregnant, I should have been thrilled. Instead, my blood ran cold. See, 18 months ago, after a pregnancy scare with my ex. Got a vasectomy. Amanda had no idea. She immediately started house hunting, sending me listings for 800 k homes. Way above our budget. The baby needs a yard, Matthew. We can't raise a family in this apartment. Her voice had this urgent, almost desperate edge I'd never heard before. I played along perfectly. Nodded at open houses, discussed mortgage rates, even met with realtors. But I was really gathering evidence. Something felt off about her sudden pregnancy announcement. Immediate push for home ownership. I remembered her work conference nine weeks ago, the exact conception window. Checked her Instagram from that weekend. Every photo featured her coworker Luke. His arm around her, intimate smiles. Definitely not just colleagues. They looked way too comfortable together. The more I dug, the worse it got. I found receipts for romantic dinners during that conference. Weekend hotel charges for room service for two, even a spa booking for couples massage. She documented her entire affair without realizing it. For seven months. I was the perfect supportive boyfriend. Went to doctor appointments where I watched her lie to medical professionals. Helped. And the baby shower? Picking out decorations while she texted Luke constantly. Even picked Out paint colors for the nursery, pretending to be excited about becoming a father. During this time, Amanda ramped up the house pressure. She scheduled multiple tours every weekend, each property more expensive than the last. Her parents got involved, offering to co sign loans. She had me meet with financial advisors about stretching our budget. The manipulation was masterful. I started noticing Luke everywhere. He'd show up at our grocery store, our coffee shop, even our gym. Amanda always acted surprised to see him, but I could tell these weren't coincidences. They were meeting regularly, probably planning their future together. With my money. The pregnancy progressed, and so did her demands. She wanted a house in the best school district, with a finished basement for a playroom and a three car garage. Every conversation became about our future family's needs. She he tear up, talking about wanting to give our child the best life possible. She even dragged my parents into it. Called them crying about how worried she was about raising a baby in our small apartment. Showed them listings of beautiful homes with white picket fences. My mom started pressuring me, too, saying I needed to step up and provide for my growing family. The baby shower was packed. Entire family, our friends, co workers, including Luke, who looked nervous the whole time. He kept checking his phone, avoiding eye contact with me. Amanda was glowing, playing the perfect expectant mother role. I'd prepared everything carefully, made Copies of my vasectomy records, printed screenshots of her social media. Even had photos from the private investigator I'd hired. But I only needed one piece of evidence for maximum impact.

What do you mean? I gripped the door handle instinctively. Briggs had been on the force for 15 years and was supposed to be showing me the ropes. He had gray streaks in his hair and eyes that never seemed to blink. Don't worry. If you listen to every word I say, you'll walk out of this alive. He pulled the patrol car into a rundown neighborhood on the east side of town. Broken street lights and boarded windows made everything look abandoned. My training officer at the academy had warned me about Briggs but said he was one of the best cops on the force. Now I was starting to wonder what best meant. Briggs parked in front of a house that looked worse than the others, paint peeling off like dead skin, front steps rotting through. The kind of place where bad things happened and cops were too scared to show up. He turned to me with those unblinking eyes. Turn off your body cam. It wasn't a request. Why would I do that? My hand moved protectively to the camera on my chest. We're not supposed to ask questions, rookie. Just do it. His voice had an edge that made me comply. I pressed the button and watch the red light go dark. Everything we'd Learned in training said this was wrong. Body cams were for our Protection. In the publics, but Briggs was my partner and I needed this job. The student loans weren't going to pay themselves. Got out of the car and approached the house. Briggs moved like a predator stalking prey. Every step calculated, every movement deliberate. He pulled out his service weapon and I copied him, even though we hadn't knocked or announced ourselves. Turn off your safety and be ready for anything, he whispered it like we were already in danger. I clicked the safety off with sweaty fingers. This felt wrong, but Briggs had 15 years of experience. Maybe this was how real police work happened. Maybe the Amy was just theory and this was practice. My heart was pounding so hard, I was sure anyone inside could hear it. Briggs didn't knock. He just raised his boot and kicked the door in. It splintered inward with a crack and we rushed inside where everything was pitch black. No lights, no sounds, just darkness so thick it felt alive. The smell hit me first, mold and something else. My eyes tried to adjust, but there was nothing to see, just shapes that might have been furniture or might have been people. Riggs gestured for us to split up, which went against everything I'd Learned, but I was too scared to argue. I went left while he went right. My gun was shaking in my hands as I felt along the wall. Each step on the creaky floor sounded like an announcement. Here I am. Come get me. My breathing was too loud in the silence. Then Briggs screamed. Not a shout or a call for backup, a full throated scream of terror that made me cream. I ran toward the sound, bouncing off walls and tripping over things in the dark. His voice came from somewhere ahead, still screaming. Right there, shoot, shoot. Now I saw movement in the darkness. Shape.

Wrapped in stainless steel, it's four hours to clean, and if you mess up even one step, it locks you out completely. The cleaning cycle must be done daily. But here's the kicker. It can only be done by someone trained on that specific machine. The training takes eight hours and cost the franchise owner $600 per employee. Most horses train one, maybe two people. So when Jeremy, our only trained ice cream technician, quit to focus on his Soundcloud career, our machine became permanently broken. The owner, Mister Chen, refused to pay for more training. Just tell customers it's broken, he said. Soft serve has the lowest profit margin anyway. For two months, I watched disappointed kids press their faces against the window, watching other people get ice cream at the Dairy Queen across the street. I watched elderly customers who driven specifically for a cone leave empty handed. One regular missus Patterson, came every Sunday for a vanilla cone after church. She'd stopped coming Altogether, I decided to fix this. I found the C602 manual online, all 296 pages of it. I studied it like my life depended on it. I watched YouTube videos of rogue McDonald's employees demonstrating the cleaning cycle. I Learned that Taylor, the manufacturer, had created a monopoly where only their technicians could repair the machines, charging franchises thousands for simple fixes. I started coming in three hours early, unpaid, to practice the cleaning cycle. The machine was like a puzzle designed by someone who hated both puzzles and people. 23 steps each with sub steps. If the milk temperature was off by 1 degree, it would fail. If you pressed buttons in the wrong sequence, it would lock. If Mercury was in retrograde, it would probably fail just to spite you. After two weeks of practice, I mastered it. I started running the cleaning cycle every night after my shift. The machine was actually working, ready to dispense ice cream. But I couldn't tell anyone because I wasn't certified. If corporate found out, Mr. Chen would be fined. So I got creative. I started accidentally leaving the machine on after my secret cleaning sessions. When customers asked for ice cream, I'd say, oh, weird, let me check. Looks like it's actually working right now. Lucky you. Word spread that our machine mysteriously worked during my shifts. Sales increased. Missus Patterson returned, saying she prayed for the machine to be fixed and crediting divine intervention. Kids would cheer when they Saw me behind the counter. I became known as the Ice Cream Whisperer. But success drew attention. The district manager, Patricia, arrived for a surprise inspection. She saw the machine working and asked who'd been maintaining it. Mister Chen panicked and said it must be maintaining itself. Patricia wasn't stupid. She pulled the maintenance logs from the machine's computer. Every cleaning cycle was time stamped at 2:00am, three hours before opening, logged under manual override. Someone's been performing unauthorized maintenance, she announced. This violates our Taylor service agreement. She started reviewing security footage. There I was, night after night, reading the manual by phone, flashlight, while navigating the machine's psychotic cleaning process. Mister Chen looked at me with a mixture of anger and confusion. You could have damaged equipment worth $30,000, Patricia said. You're not sir

The courtroom erupted until I stood, handed the judge a two page document and said, check again. Judge simply looked at my wife and burst out laughing. My name is James, and three months ago I caught my wife Lauren cheating with her yoga instructor. Filed for divorce immediately thinking she'd hit the Jackpot. Since we've been married for five years, Lauren strutted into that Phoenix courtroom wearing a two thousand dollar dress I'd bought her. Confident as hell. Her lawyer was already calculating his commission on what they thought would be a four million dollar payout for my construction business and dad's inheritance. The whole courtroom was packed. Lauren had actually invited some of her friends to watch what she called James's comeuppance. She been telling everyone for weeks how she was about to become independently wealthy. Your honor, her attorney announced, adjusting his expensive tie, missus Peterson deserves substantial compensation for supporting her husband's career growth during their five year marriage. Lauren actually winked at me from across the room. She thought I was just some heartbroken guy who'd roll over and pay whatever she demanded. Her friends in the gallery were practically grinning, waiting for the show. But here's what Lauren didn't know. Six months before I caught her cheating, I'd started noticing weird charges on our joint credit card. Expensive dinners at restaurants I'd never been to, hotel rooms, Booked during girls trips that didn't add up. Designer lingerie purchases that never made it home. The final straw was when I found an eight hundred dollar charge at a jewelry store downtown. When I asked Lauren about it, she said she'd bought herself a birthday present. Problem was, her birthday wasn't for four months. So I hired a private investigator named Frank. Best $5,000 I ever spent. Frank followed Lauren for six weeks. What he discovered was worse than I imagined. The yoga instructor was just the latest in a long line of affair. There was also her personal trainer, a bartender from her favorite restaurant, and even one of my own business partners. Lauren had been using our joint accounts to fund these relationships. Expensive gifts, romantic getaways. Been paying for her affairs, gym memberships. She'd blown through nearly $50,000 of our money over two years. The two page document I handed Judge Ramirez wasn't financial records, with Frank's detailed investigation report proving Lauren had been having multiple affairs for over two years, complete with time stamped photos, hotel receipts, restaurant bills, and screenshots of explicit text messages. In Arizona, adultery doesn't automatically disqualify you from alimony. But it sure does when you've been systematically draining marital assets to fund your affairs. It's called waste of marital property, and it's a big deal in divorce court. The judge read the first page slowly, his eyebrows climbing higher with each line. Flip to page 2. Study the photos and Then burst out laughing so hard his glasses nearly fell off. Missus Peterson, he said, trying to compose himself, not only are you getting nothing from this divorce, but according to this evidence, you owe your husband $47,000 for systematic misuse of marital funds. Lauren's face went from smug to confused to horrified in about three seconds flat. Her friends in the gallery started whisper frantically. One of them actually got up and left. Her lawyer immediately started packing his briefcase, clearly realizing this case had just become a career nightmare instead of a payday. Furthermore, Judge Ramirez continued, given the extensive documentation of financial misconduct, Mrs. Peterson will be responsible for all legal fees incurred by both parties. That meant Lauren owed an additional $23,000 in attorney costs. As we left the courtroom, I overheard Lauren frantically calling someone on her phone, mom, I need to move back in.

My brother Jake was getting married to this girl who seemed super sweet at first. She was all smiles and hugs whenever I was around. But when it came time to pick bridesmaid dresses, her true colors started showing. She wanted everyone to wear this specific coral pink dress that cost $800, not including alterations. I'm a college student working part time at a coffee shop, making barely enough to cover my rent and ramen noodles. $800 might as well have been 8,000. I politely told her I couldn't afford it and asked if there was maybe a cheaper option or if I could get something similar in the same color. She literally laughed at me and said if I couldn't afford to be in her wedding, maybe I shouldn't be in it at all. But then she quickly backtracked when she realized how that sounded and suggested I could just borrow money from my parents. Here's the thing, my parents died in a car accident when I was 17. Jake knew this. His fiance knew this. I've been on my own since then, working my way through school with student loans and whatever jobs I could find. I explained my situation again, thinking maybe she forgot. She rolled her eyes and said I was being dramatic and that everyone has to make sacrifices for weddings. Then she suggested I could sell some of my stuff or pick up Extra shifts to make it happen. I was already working 30 hours a week on top of full time classes. I had nothing left to sell except my laptop, which I needed for school and my car, which I needed to get to work. The whole thing made me feel like absolute garbage. Jake wasn't much better. When I went to him for help, he said his fiance was just stressed about wedding planning and that I should try to understand. He offered to lend me the money, but I'd have to pay him back within six months with interest because they were saving for a house. Interest from my own brother, for a dress I'd wear once to watch him marry someone who clearly thought I was beneath her. That's when I realised this wasn't really about the money. It was about respect. She could have easily picked a less expensive dress or worked with everyone's budgets. Instead, she chose to make it a test of who really wanted to be there for her special day. I told Jake I couldn't make it work and wouldn't be in the wedding party. He got angry and said I was being selfish and trying to ruin his big day. His fiance jumped in and said she wasn't surprised because I'd always been jealous of their relationship and was probably looking for an excuse to cause drama. The whole thing blew up. Jake said if I couldn't support him as a bridesmaid. Then maybe I shouldn't come at all. I said fine, and didn't go to the wedding. I spent that Saturday working a double shift at the coffee shop, making the money I would have blown on a dress I'd never wear again.

I'm 27 years old and my boyfriend Jake is 33. We've been together for almost two years now, and honestly, marriage is probably in our future, but we're not rushing it. Here's the thing, though. My mom still treats me like I'm some teenager sneaking around behind her back whenever we visit my parents. She makes this huge deal about us not sleeping in the same bed, like we're gonna corrupt her precious house or something. We're adults who live together and pay our own, but apparently that doesn't matter to her. She acts like we're gonna start making out at the dinner table if we share a room. This past summer, Jake suggested we just get a hotel room so we could actually be comfortable and not deal with her weird rules. You would have thought we told her we were starting a meth lab in her basement. She went completely insane about it, kept going on and on about how disrespectful we were and how we embarrassed her in front of the neighbors because someone might see us going to the hotel together. She literally made me promise not to do that again like I was 8 years old asking for permission to have a sleepover. I felt so stupid agreeing to it, but I didn't want the drama. So when Christmas planning came around, Jake's parents invited us to visit them in Mexico. They retired there a few years ago and they're super chill people. We decided to go because honestly, it sounded amazing beach weather in December while everyone back home is freezing their asses off. Yes, please. But here's where I got a little sneaky. We didn't tell my parents we weren't coming home for Christmas. When my mom asked me at Thanksgiving if I was gonna keep my promise about not getting a hotel, I told her the truth that I wouldn't be staying at any hotel when we visited them, which was technically true since we weren't visiting them at all. So there I was sitting on this gorgeous balcony overlooking the Caribbean, drinking coffee and watching the sunrise when I made the mistake of checking Facebook. My mom and sisters had posted all this passive aggressive stuff about how hurt they were that I lied to them and how selfish I was for abandoning the family on Christmas. I was feeling pretty good from the vacation drinks the night before because I decided to respond.

Some of their friends, Started commenting, asking why they were trying to control their adult daughter's sleeping arrangements.

My husband ambushed me during our 5th anniversary dinner and said, Kelly, I've been thinking. We need to evolve past possessiveness and jealousy. We are mature adults and we should be exploring connections without restrictions. Being so possessive isn't healthy. He showed me articles on his phone about polyamory. Actually trying to mask his request like some morally good decision. I looked at the engraved watch hidden in my purse, his anniversary gift. Asked him, you want an open marriage? His eyes lit up like Christmas, even though I hadn't agreed yet. Yes. See? You get it. Most wives would get controlling and insecure, but you understand that love multiplies. I pushed the gift deeper into my purse. Alright, no possessiveness, no restrictions. Let's transcend. Little did he know that I was about to transcend his entire existence. I downloaded dating apps that very night while he watched stamelessly grinning about our journey to enlightenment. Within hours, I'd matched with Doug, his gym buddy, who messaged me finally. Been waiting respectfully for years. And then I matched with Axel, his department director, who wrote, I always admired your brilliance at company events. Dinner tonight. When Doug's name flashed on my phone at breakfast, his coffee mug froze midair. Wait, is that my Doug? My workout partner? He's not your Doug, I said, typing back. That would be possessive, remember? But I see him every Morning at the gym. And now I'll see him for dinner. Isn't expanding connections beautiful? His face went through five different shades of panic. You can't date Doug. We spot each other. We're gym brothers. Brothers? That sounds like toxic, masculine possession to me. The orchid arrangement from Axel arrived Tuesday with a card. Extraordinary. Evening, Jay. My husband had already opened it when I got home. My boss is sending you flowers. He's very thoughtful. He asked me about our arrangement in the partner's meeting. In front of everyone. Asked how I felt about sharing my wife. Do you know how humiliating that was? No, I don't. Then came his mother's garden party that Saturday, which was pure chaos. I brought Nathan, a surgeon I'd met that week. Mom, Dad, this is Kelly's friend. My husband started. Boyfriend, I corrected. This is my boyfriend, Nathan. His mother's champagne glass trembled. Your what? Nathan, my boyfriend, your son, introduced me to ethical non monogamy. He says jealousy is just insecurity. She turned to him with eyes blazing in anger. You said what? Mom, it's not like that. It's exactly like that, I said cheerfully. He explained that monogamy is social conditioning. We're both free to explore. Actually, he even encouraged me to bring Nathan today, normalize our lifestyle. His father pulled him aside immediately. Son, have you lost your goddamn mind? While Nathan charmed the garden club ladies, I heard his mother telling her sister to look up intervention specialists. It was amazing watching my husband already start to regret his choice. But it wasn't the end yet. When I got dressed for another date in the dress he bought me for Christmas, he watched from the doorway. Where are you going now? Doug got us into that jazz club you've been wait listing for months. How? I've been trying since January. He knows the owner. See, multiple partners means expanded social access. Love multiplies, just like you said. The next morning, while I confirmed plans with Axel for his yacht club event, my husband was spiraling. Kelly, this isn't what I envisioned. I thought maybe coffee with strangers occasionally. Not you. Dating my boss and my

So I invited him to family dinner. My fiance, Rebecca, really picked the worst time to call me paranoid about her ex, Nate. We were literally sitting there tasting wedding cakes when she brought it up. She kept insisting they were just friends now and I was being controlling. The thing was, I'd come home early from a work trip last week and saw his car leaving our apartment complex at 2:00am. She had no idea I'd seen it. Every time his name popped up on her phone, she'd flip it face down real quick. When she called me insecure again, I decided to call her bluff. You're right. I'm being unfair. Let's invite Nate to your parents anniversary dinner next week, I said. I watched all the color drain from her face. She tried to backtrack and her family wouldn't want extra guests at their special dinner, but I pushed harder. I'll call him myself to show I trust you. She was trapped and we both knew it. She agreed, but her hands were literally shaking. That night I called Nate and made sure to put him on speaker so Rebecca could hear everything. I told him I wanted to apologize for being the jealous boyfriend and invited him to the family dinner. Rebecca just sat there watching me, completely stuck, tried to turn me down, said it wasn't a good idea. But I kept Pushing, telling him Rebecca really wanted him there. I even offered to pick him up myself, you know, to show there were no hard feelings. When I picked him up that night, the guy was sweating through his dress shirt during the drive. He mentioned Rebecca's parents hated him but wouldn't tell me why. We walked into that dinner together and I swear the whole room just froze. Rebecca's mom dropped her wine glass and it shattered all over the floor. Her dad's face went from normal to purple in about two seconds. What is he doing here? He practically growled. I played innocent and explained I'd invited Rebecca's friend to make peace. Her sister actually laughed out loud. Friends after what he did to her. Right then Rebecca's phone lit up on the table. A text from Nate popped up on the screen. This was a mistake. We should be more careful. Everyone saw it. Her sister snatched the phone before Rebecca could grab it. More messages were right there on the lock screen. Meeting times last night was amazing. And what looked like photos being sent back and forth. Her dad jumped up so fast his chair fell backwards. You're seeing him again. Nate was already heading for the door. Rebecca ran after him, begging him to wait. That's when her family just exploded. Her mom started telling me how Nate had cheated on Rebecca years ago with her own roommate. He'd lied about it for six months. Straight. The whole family had been there for Rebecca through that nightmare of a breakup. And now she was sneaking around with him again. Two months before our wedding, Rebecca came back inside with her makeup running down her face. Her family looked at her like she was a stranger. They telling me story after story about what Nate had put her through. How could you invite him here, Rebecca screamed at me. I stayed calm and reminded her that she told me he was harmless. What was wrong with inviting a friend to dinner? Her family wouldn't stop listing all the terrible things Nate had done, the cheating, the constant lies, how he'd completely vanished after destroying her life. Her sister was still scrolling through the phone, showing everyone more evidence. Hotel bookings from last.

Four years later, I found them in our bed three days before our wedding. My fiance Jessica, and her stepbrother, Braden. She didn't even try to explain. Just looked at me and said, I love him. Her engagement ring was still on. While she held his hand, Braden smirked. Sorry, man. It just happened. Her parents had married two years ago. That night, Jessica posted photos with Braden like nothing happened. Changed her relationship status. While our wedding vendors were still calling me. I had to cancel everything alone. The venue, the flowers, the honeymoon. Each call was humiliation. The hotel manager asked, is the bride okay? I couldn't even answer. But I turned that rage into purpose. Studied for the bar exam like my life depended on it. Passed first try, got hired as a paralegal at a family law firm. My job? Research custody cases and find evidence. My boss said I had unusual drive. I had unusual motivation. While I Learned every detail about custody battles and what makes a parent unfit. Jessica and Braden played house, had a daughter, posted family photos online. Their parents barely visited, but they insisted their love was worth it. I became the firm's best researcher. The paralegal who found evidence that won cases. Lawyers requested me for their hardest custody battles. I knew exactly what judges looked for, what evidence mattered, how to prove someone was lying about being A good parent. Three years in, I was the go to person for impossible cases. I turned my pain into expertise. While Jessica and Braden raised their daughter, I became an expert at determining who deserved to keep their kids. Life has a strange sense of humor. Four years later, Braden walked into my firm. I was in the conference room, and I heard his voice at reception, desperate. Explaining how Jessica wanted full custody of their daughter. My boss knocked. Can you handle this case? Do the research? I almost said no. Then curiosity one. Braden looked destroyed. Didn't recognize me at first. I changed. Lost weight, expensive suit, different hairstyle. He was too focused on his problem. She's saying I'm an unfit father, that our relationship was wrong from the start. Then he really looked at me. His face went white. Your. Oh, god. Started to leave, but my boss insisted. Please sit. We're here to help. Braden slumped back down, kept glancing at me while explaining Jessica had cheated with her trainer, now wanted their daughter. Was telling the court Braden wasn't a good father, that their relationship had been unhealthy. The irony was perfect. She'd left me for him. Now she was leaving him and trying to take their child. My boss assured Braden, we take the case. Braden didn't realize I'd be building the entire case, finding every piece of evidence that would determine if he kept his daughter. I spent three weeks investigating, found Jessica's texts to friends bragging about her trainer. Discovered she'd been leaving their daughter with babysitters constantly. Located witnesses who saw Braden at every school event while Jessica was at the gym. Built a file proving who the real parent was. At the custody hearing, I sat at the lawyer's table organizing evidence. Jessica walked in, confident. Until she saw me. Her face went pale. She grabbed her lawyer's arm, whispering frantically. The judge noticed her panic. For two hours, I handed my boss every document.

Meet my boyfriend, the human calculator. Everyone laughed. I smiled and nodded like always. But something snapped inside me. Wednesday morning, I opened a separate checking account. If I'm so cheap, might as well lean into it. That afternoon, Sarah texted wanting to grab Starbucks. I met her there, ordered myself a venti caramel macchiato, got her a tall Black coffee, no additions. Why'd you get me the small size? She asked, confused. Well, since I'm famously cheap, I figured you'd prefer to upgrade your own order. She laughed awkwardly, thinking I was joking. Back Thursday, we went to dinner at our usual Mexican place. When the check came, $47, 83, I pulled out my phone calculator, put it exactly down the middle, put down 2390 twos. You're seriously calculating it to the cent, she asked. Just being true to my nature, I said cheerfully. You always say I'm cheap. Friday, she texted saying she was short on gas money. Hint, hint. Usually I'd Venmo her $30 without thinking. Instead, I replied, sorry, babe, you know how cheap I am. Can't spare it. She called immediately, are you being serious right now? Dead serious. I'm embracing who you say I am. Saturday, she wanted to see the new Marvel movie. I bought one ticket online, showed up to meet her at the theater. Where's my ticket, she asked. Oh, I didn't buy you one. That would be generous. And generous isn't really my brand, remember? She stood there stunned while I walked into the theater. Got 17 texts during the previews. Sunday morning, she came over with breakfast sandwiches, set one in front of me expectantly. Thanks for thinking of me, I said, but I can't accept this. Letting someone else pay for my food wouldn't be very cheap of me. She slammed her hand on the counter. Okay. Enough. This is insane. You're taking my jokes way too seriously. I sipped my coffee calmly. Jokes, Sarah, you've called me cheap literally hundreds of times in front of your friends, your family, strangers at restaurants. I didn't mean it like that. How did you mean it then when you introduced me to your co workers as the guy who splits appetizers? When you told the Uber driver I'd probably ask for a receipt, her face was getting red. Those were jokes. Were they, though? Because you seem pretty committed to the bit. Monday, she tried a different approach, suggested we go grocery shopping together.

But I've been deployed for 8 months. Who's baby? I'm staring at my phone at 3 a. M. In Afghanistan. My girlfriend tiara just posted this elaborate pregnancy announcement on Instagram. Pink balloons, professional photos, the works. Caption read finally pregnant 3 months along. Time to lock this idiot down. Military wifey why she baby on board? He doesn't know yet. I did the math, then did it again. I've been deployed for 8 months. Last time I was home was January. It's now September. 3 months pregnant means she conceived in June when I was 5,000 miles away eating MREs. I typed one comment who's baby? What happened next was bib. Her phone started going insane, comments flooding in, people doing the same math I did. Screenshot spreading everywhere. She tried to delete the post, but it kept glitching, failing while people kept screenshotting. Within an hour I had 73 DMs from mutual friends. My mom was calling at 3 a. M. Her time. But the best part Tiara's mom commented before the deletion so Proud. Derek will be such a good father. Derek not my name, I'm Evan. Then tiara went live fake crying about being a deployment widow and how I abandoned her. She slipped up again. Derek I mean in therapy has helped me realize, someone commented therapists don't usually father their patients babies, hon. She ended the live immediately. Then my neighbor Derek, the guy I asked to check on Her messaged me bro, what did you expect? I was there when you weren't. Do the right thing and let her go. PS she's moving in with me. The audacity was unreal. This unemployed dude living off my deployed girlfriend wants me to do the right thing. I screenshot everything and send it to everyone we know. But wait, it gets worse. Tiara's mom called my mom at 4:00am. My mom recorded the whole thing. Your son needs to accept responsibility. For what? He's been deployed for 8 months. For abandoning tiara. She had needs. Baby needs support from its real father, Derek. But Evan makes more money. Military pays well. Derek's between jobs. Between jobs? This dude's been unemployed the whole time? Then came the legal threats. Some sketchy lawyer emailed my military account demanding monthly support payments for emotional distress. Half my house value. I bought it before we met. Continued health insurance, $10,000 for baby supplies, A written apology for public humiliation. My JAG lawyer laughed until he cried. She wants military benefits while pregnant with another man's baby. This is comedy gold. But the peak entitlement happened next. Tiara made a TikTok crying in her car, the one I was still paying insurance on, talking about deployment abuse and started hashtag dash deployment widow. The comments destroyed her. Ma'am, he's literally commenting from Afghanistan. Deploy. I meant widow. He's very much alive. Imagine telling your kid daddy was deployed when you were conceived. Then I got Emergency leave approved. First, stop changing my locks. Tiara had been living in my house with Eric. I walked in to find Eric's clothes in my closet, his gaming setup in my office, sound photos on my fridge, and a future Mr. And Mrs. Morrison sign in the living room. Morrison? Derek's last name. While packing their stuff, I found Tiara's pregnancy journal. One entry made my blood boil. Derek says we should wait until Evans deployed longer so he can't contest anything. Military guys get screwed in court. This baby will secure the bag. Then they came home. Derek went white seeing me. Bro, I can explain. Get out of my house. Tiara started her performance. Babe

Then I saw the group photo. All of them, on a private beach in Maui. I stared at my phone in disbelief. My entire family had ditched my wedding for a vacation. The caption read, finally together. Like I didn't exist. But here's what they didn't know. For years, I've been quietly bankrolling their lifestyle. The family business cards all linked to my accounts. Your mortgage co signs my credit. The lake house, utilities, auto pay from my bank. I've been the invisible ATM, funding their perfect lives while they whispered that my wife wasn't their kind of people. So I sent one text back. Perfect timing. Then I called my attorney. Within an hour, I'd cut off every shared account, canceled every auto payment, and revoked access to everything. The secondary property my sister lived in. She was using my credit for the rate. Not anymore. It started small. Day 3, the dealership called about a bounced car lease. Day 5, the office building sent late rent warnings. By week 2, the group chat was pure your chaos. Can someone cover the lakehouse utilities? My card got declined for Scottsdale. Does the company still cover insurance? They were scrambling, but still no apology. Just confusion about why their money fountain suddenly only dried up. Then my sister called. First time since the wedding. Not congratulations or sorry we missed it. Just, you can't do this to us. I didn't even answer, just blocked the number. But the real fun was just beginning. See, I'd forgotten about one little detail. My dad's precious boat. The 40 foot yacht he loved showing off at the Marina every weekend. Guess whose name was on the insurance policy? Week three. 3, I got a call from the Marina. Sir, your boat insurance was declined for non payment. We need it removed by Friday or it gets impounded. I could have warned him. Should have, maybe. Instead, I drove to the Marina Thursday night with my wife and a bottle of champagne. We sat on the dock and watched them tow away Dad's pride and joy. My wife raised her glass. To new beginnings. Too expensive lessons. I replied. The group chat exploded. The next morning, my aunt was practically screaming in all caps, the boat is gone! Who didn't pay the insurance had called me 17 times. I let every single one go to voicemail. Each message got more desperate. Son, please call me back. There's been some mistake. We can work this out. Work what out? That they skipped my wedding for cocktails on a beach? Then my mom tried a different approach. She showed up at my office unannounced, tears streaming down her face. Security called up to ask if I wanted to see her. Tell her I'm in Maui, I said. The security guard paused. Sir, she says she's your mother. Not anymore. But the nuclear option came. When my uncle called, Uncle Rick, the family mediator, the guy who always smooth things over at Thanksgiving, his voice was shaking. Your father's having chest pains. The stress is killing him. You need to stop this. Funny, I said I had chest pains, too. Right around the time I saw 40 people. I love choosing a vacation over the most important.

When I was 17, my whole world was shattered with six words. You'll never be my real daughter. Warren had raised me since I was five, been to every school play, taught me to ride a bike. But during a fight about college applications, when I mentioned wanting to study culinary arts instead of business like his biological kids, his mask finally slipped. Fiona and Kevin would never disappoint me like this. But then again, there actually mine, he said, his voice cold. Fiona and Kevin were his biological children, and he had always treated us differently. I saw the truth in his eyes that day. 12 years of playing dad, and I was still just his wife's baggage to him. That's when something crystallized in me. I wasn't going to beg for his approval anymore. Instead, I'd become so undeniably successful that his rejection would become his loss. I started documenting everything I cooked, building a portfolio, and entering every competition I could find. While Warren boasted about Fiona's MCAT scores and Kevin's internships at family dinners, I quietly applied for apprenticeships at Michelin star restaurants. When I got accepted to train under a James Beard Award winner in New York, I didn't even tell him. Mom knew, but I asked her to keep it quiet. I want to focus on my craft, I said. Though, really, I just couldn't bear To hear him diminish this, too. For three years, I disappeared into the culinary world. I worked six teen hour days with burns up my arms, screaming chefs in my ears, all while sleeping in a shared apartment. I worked my way up from prep cook to line cook to sous chef, each position more demanding than the last. Meanwhile, Warren would send mom photos from Fiona's white coat ceremony and Kevin's graduation, never once asking how I was doing. During rare video calls with my mom, he'd be in the background, occasionally throwing in comments like, still playing with food, or, Fiona just published her first research paper. As if I needed the comparison, I started developing my own style. Fusion techniques combining molecular gastronomy with comfort food. Things that caught the attention of food critics. When a famous food magazine wanted to do a feature on rising young chefs, I almost said no, afraid that Warren would see it and ridicule me even further. But my mentor convinced me by saying, cook for yourself. That article LED to me opening my own restaurant and feeding more than 300 people every single day. Then one day, I got an invitation to Fiona's engagement party. I almost and go. But then I realized I wasn't the weak girl scared of her stepdad's judgment anymore. So I went and arrived fashionably late. Fiona spotted me, and her face lit up like Christmas. Oh, my god, Lena! Kevin rushed in behind her. It's so nice to see you. They hadn't seen me in two years. We saw the article about your restaurant opening. Kevin said, that's so cool. Fiona grabbed my hands. My friend ate there last week. She couldn't stop raving about it. Said it was transformative.

When my high school announced a complete meat ban last September, we thought it was a joke. Any student caught with meat products faces immediate suspension. Principal Harrison declared at assembly, we're becoming a progressive, wellness campus. She'd installed actual security guards who would check for meat products in our bags. Even the cafeteria would only serve vegan options. This is about teaching sustainable living, she said, ignoring the groans from 1,800 teenagers. The football team nearly rioted. But we need protein for sports, they argued. Plants have protein. DOC Harrison replied, fine, we'd play her game. But here's what Doctor Harrison didn't realize. She just declared war on teenagers who lived on chicken nuggets. And we were about to show her what happened when you messed with our food. On day one, Cleo came to school wearing what looked like a normal dress until you got close. She'd actually sewn together hundreds of beef jerky wrappers on it. Cleo, that's inappropriate, Doctor Harrison said during first period. Go change immediately. Cleo stood up slowly. Of course, Doctor Harrison. Then she pulled off the dress to reveal another outfit underneath, a shirt with a giant photo of a T bone steak. The whole class erupted to Harrison's face, went red. Office now! But Cleo sacrifice had inspired everyone. The next day, Tommy walked into school carrying a chicken. An actual live chicken. What is that? Doctor Harrison shrieked, running into the hallway. Colonel Sanders, Tommy said calmly, producing a stack of papers. He's my emotional support animal. Here's the documentation from my therapist. She grabbed the papers, reading frantically. This is can't be real. Call my therapist if you want, Tommy said. The chicken promptly pooped on her shoe. She couldn't refuse, since it was all legitimate. Within a week, ten different students had emotional support chickens. Hallways were literal chaos from all their poop and screaming. I watched Doctor Harrison chase one through the cafeteria while it knocked over trash cans. Whose chicken is this? She screamed. That's Mcnugget, someone yelled. The second week was even worse. The chemistry club claimed they were doing an experiment on artificial flavoring when smoke started pouring from their lab. But really, they were trying to release a special scent. And it worked. Within minutes, the entire school reeked of bacon. Every protein scanner in the building went haywire, beeping non stop. What did you do? Doctor Harrison burst into the chemistry room. It's just artificial scent molecules, Jennifer said in a we're studying Esther's. The smell was so strong that parents called asking why their kids came home smelling like breakfast. Then Dante turned his locker into a black market deli. I watched him slip a piece of beef jerky to a freshman for $5. That's insane, I said. Supply and demand. He shrugged. I'm the only supplier. He got caught the next day when Doctor Harrison personally searched his locker. Three day suspension. She Screamed old, filling up a bag of jerky. Like evidence in a murder trial. Dante walked out with his head high. Someone started a free Dante chant. Doctor Harrison was falling apart. Then came Spirit weeks International Food Day. At exactly 12 p m. Dex, our quarterback, stood on the center cafeteria table holding a three foot party sub packed with every meat imaginable. This is for everyone tired of eating grass! He shouted, taking a massive bite. Doctor Harrison burst through the doors, screaming immediate!

I can't be your mom anymore. I need to find myself. What mom didn't know was that I'd thank her for this one day. It was exactly one year since dad died, and she'd promised we'd visit his grave together. I'd saved my allowance for three weeks to buy yellow roses, his favorites, and stayed up late making cookies for him, like he taught me before the accident. I made sure to remind mom about it. Remember, we have to visit Dad's grave before we go to my birthday party, okay? My mom smiled, reassured me that she was all packed and ready to go. I found out exactly what she meant by ready to go. On the morning of my 12th birthday, I woke up to find her car was already gone from the driveway, and her room was cleared out of all her belongings, leaving behind nothing but a note. I didn't shed a tear. I just walked. The cemetery was three miles from the house, but I went anyway, carrying a tin of cookies and a grocery store bouquet. My feet were sore and had busted calluses by the time I got there, but nothing hurt more than losing both my parents on my birthday, just one year apart from each other. One by accident, one by choice. So while I sat there sobbing on the stone, my dad's best friend, Joel Walked up and sat beside me in the MUD. We sat there talking about my dad for a while. All the good memories we had. Then he asked the question I had hoped he wouldn't. Did you walk here? By the way, where's your mom? He asked, pointing to my worn out shoes. She's not coming, I told him. As calm as a 12 year old could be at that moment. Joel nodded. How about you stay with me and my wife for the night? I have a daughter, Ava, who could use a friend tonight, too. I didn't even nod, just followed him back to the car, silently staring out the window. And while they took me in, it wasn't always the easiest. I stayed in my room most of the time, hiding away, thinking I was a burden. They'd eventually leave, too. Ava was the first to melt down my walls. She spent every morning braiding my hair before we went to school, something mom never bothered to do, even when dad was around. Their Thursday family game nights were bizarre to me at first because nobody screamed when they lost or threw the board across the room like mom always did. Joel's wife L helped me with homework, saying some things take more effort than others. Plus, I never really liked math, so I don't blame you. But just as things were getting better, I saw something that broke me all over again. My mom had posted A photo of herself at the beach, captioned, no regrets living for me and my happiness. I just lost it completely. Joel heard me sobbing and came in. Didn't say anything, just held me while I sobbed and ranted. Then he drove me to the hospital. Your dad and I used to come here when things got hard, he said, leading me through the children's ward. Helping these kids reminded us why we became doctors. We spent the night reading stories to kids who couldn't sleep, bringing juice boxes to worried parents, watching Joel work his magic turning scared faces into smiles. We were so busy helping people who had it worse that I eventually forgot about mom. We kept going back every week. I Learned every kid's name, their favorite colors, and in the middle of it all, I finally felt a sense of belonging and direction. I told Joel on the way back home, I want to be a doctor, too. His eyes grew wide, smiling proudly at me. Your dad would love that. Medical school flew by with Joel bringing me to Dad's grave after every semester to share my grades. I quickly forgot about mom, even unfriending her so I wouldn't see her posts about exploring yourself in your

Marry for love, please, my mom said, rolling her eyes. That's just B S. That Disney shows have been promoting since the 30s. Your mother is right. You need to face reality. Dad agreed while reading through his newspapers. Marry bridge is transactional. You either choose stability or choose stupidity. They continue to compare my struggling artist boyfriend to their friend's successful heart surgeon son. For years, I defended him, but it was futile. When I turned 26, my parents gave me an ultimatum. Continue dating my boyfriend or get cut off from the family completely. That meant no more help paying off student loans, phone plans, car insurance, everything. I loved my boyfriend, but neither of us could afford to live without my parents support. So we broke up mutually. And I started dating Jacob, the surgeon. Now, don't get me wrong, he's a gentleman. Perfect on paper, in every way. Rich, pretty, attractive, and great with his hands. You know, as a surgeon. We quickly got engaged, and my parents were thrilled, bragging to everyone about how they got their daughter to break up with her bad boyfriend and listen to them. But, boy, were they going to regret it. You see, Jacob had only one flaw. He was a mama's boy. And unfortunately, his mama, Mildred, was worse than mine. So when Jacob moved in with us, she did, too, taking Over my parents master bedroom, saying that they always slept together again. Not in that way. But that was just the start of things. Mildred had other quirks. She constantly complained about my mom's cooking, making sure it was perfect for her little Jacob. She cut down dad's rose bush to keep a safe environment for her baby boy. Within a month, she managed to redecorate the entire house from soft and elegant to leopard print and gold. Throwing out all the antiques because it was depressing. Of course. Everything was ordered using my parents credit card. Because we're family now, and family share. And then came the seven emotional support Chihuahuas that chewed on the sofa, barked constantly, and enjoyed biting and growling at my dad. And the best part of it all was the fact that Jacob refused to stand up to her. Even when it was clear on his face that he was tired of her craziness too. When my parents tried talking to him about it all, he told them, the moment you disagree, she'll terminate the engagement. Is that what you want? By the exhausted looks on their faces, they weren't even sure anymore. But then it happened. Mildred's ultimate 65th birthday bash. Spectacular at our house. Without permission or even so much as a warning. My parents came home to find 200 strangers destroying the house. Kids ran around with markers, drawing on the walls and furniture, while their parents spilled food and drinks. All over the hardwood floor. One couple got hot and steamy in my parents'room. There's raided mom and dad's jewelry, stuffing their pockets. The entire place was worse than any frat house party I'd seen. While they looked for Mildred, one of the seven Chihuahuas latched onto my dad's leg. He shook his leg around, yelling for help, but was quickly surrounded by other dancing men in the mix. With dad distracted, mom went on the hunt for Mildred. And stopped dead in her tracks when she spotted a teenager cutting the strings to her precious piano, the only thing that ever gave her happiness. She broke down sobbing. The house was destroyed by the time the party ended. Stains everywhere, broken furniture. And for perfectionist parents, oh, it was a sight to behold. And Mildred already snuck out for her month long cruise, leaving my parents to deal with the mess she'd made. Because we're family. And that's when I saw it. Regret plastered on their faces. My parents broke down in front of me, sobbing. You need to break up with him immediately. We'll pay for everything. We'll help you get your boyfriend back. We'll apologize to him ourselves.

My daughter's fourth grade teacher told her class that blood is blue inside your body and only turns red when it hits oxygen. Lily came home repeating this fact while showing me her veins. I gently explained, that's actually not true. Blood is always red because of hemoglobin, just darker red in veins. She looked at me confused, but Missus Wilson showed us a whole Powerpoint about it. Dad. She even had diagrams from a science book. Next morning, I packed my work scrubs in my bag. I'm an ER nurse at Mercy General and I was working the three PM shift. Anyway, I sent Missus Wilson an email asking if I could do a quick 15 minute presentation about blood for Career Day that afternoon. She loved the idea. When I arrived, Missus Wilson introduced me as Lily's dad, who works at the hospital. Twenty eight kids stared up at me from their desks, covered in Lisa Frank folders and Minecraft pencil cases. I heard you guys Learned that blood is blue inside your body, I said. The entire class nodded enthusiastically. Missus Wilson beamed from her desk. I pulled out a vacutainer blood collection tube from my pocket. This is what we use to draw blood at the hospital. Notice something? I held it up. The tube creates a vacuum. No oxygen inside at all.

Still red. The kids were fascinated. I showed them medical textbook pages on my tablet. Missus Wilson kept clearing her throat, her face getting redder than the blood samples on my screen. But our textbook says it's blue, one boy argued, pointing to their science book. I walked over and checked the publication date. 1998. Medicine Updates pretty fast, I explained. We used to think lots of things that turned out to be wrong. Missus Wilson suddenly stood up. Well, thank you for that interesting presentation, Mister. Johnson, but we need to move on to math now. I nodded and started packing up when a girl raised her hand. So our textbook is wrong? The class erupted in whispers. Missus Wilson's voice got tight. The curriculum says. Actually, I interrupted, pulling up the state science standards on my phone, the current curriculum specifically mentions this myth as something to correct. I showed her the screen. That's when she asked me to step in to the hallway. The kids watched wide eyed as the door closed behind us. Do you have any idea how hard it is to teach these kids when parents undermine my authority? She hissed. Now they'll question everything I say. I kept my voice calm. Isn't that exactly what we want them to do? Question things and learn critical thinking? I've Been teaching for 22 years, she snapped. I'm not changing my whole curriculum because some nurse thinks he knows better than our textbooks. That night, Lily asked me if she was in trouble because Missus Wilson kept giving her mean looks all afternoon. I assured her she wasn't. The next day, Missus Wilson announced a pop quiz with questions like what color is blood inside the body? Lily answered red and got marked wrong. She came home crying with a big red F. I requested a meeting with the principal and brought printouts of medical tech

Aria was the girl who'd throw any girl under the bus for five seconds of male approval. Since freshman year, everyone knew Aria as the girl who'd loudly announce she only hung out with guys because girls are too much drama. She'd sit at the guys table, laugh at every sexist joke louder than anyone else, and somehow convinced herself that calling other girls too sensitive made her so. The crazy part was the guys ate it up. Even teachers thought Aria was refreshingly laid back compared to other girls. I remember this one time in PE when a girl complained about the boys snapping girls bra straps. Aria actually stood up and said it's just guys being guys, stop being such a baby about it. The male coach literally thanked her for being rational. That was Aria's whole thing. She was the cool girl who got it. She'd brag about watching porn with the guys, rate other girls bodies with them, and called feminism victim mentality. Girls who tried to call out inappropriate behavior became her targets. He'd mock them with fake crying sounds, post their complaints on social media to ridicule them, and loudly proclaim how she wasn't like those uptight bitches who couldn't take a joke. During junior year, when Natalie reported getting groped at a party, Aria was the first to say Natalie was probably asking for it. Wearing that dress, the guys would high Five her. Call her basically a dude with tits, and she'd beam like she'd won the lottery. When we all came back on Monday after spring break of senior year, we were preparing for the moment. Aria went off on a girl and snickered with one of her guy friends. But first period arrives, and Aria walks past the guy table without even glancing at them. Not like avoiding them. Aria just walked past like they didn't exist. She sits down at a table full of girls, the same girls she'd spent three years mocking. Vivian, who she'd called a dramatic princess. Dre, who she'd labeled attention seeking for reporting harassment. Natalie, whose reputation she'd tried to destroy. The guys started calling her over. Yo, Aria, we saved your spot. She didn't even turn her head. It was like she'd gone deaf to male voices. At first, everyone thought it was some weird joke. Maybe she lost a bet over spring break. Maybe this was some elaborate prank that would turn into the ultimate pick me moment. We were on the edge of our seat, waiting for her to burst out yelling, I was right. Girls are too much drama. But Aria kept sitting with the girls. She stopped responding to the guys texts, unfollowed all of them on every platform. When Ethan tried to talk to her after chemistry, she looked right through him and kept walking. Days turned into weeks. Guys went from confused to angry. They started Spreading rumors that Aria was on her period, that she turned into a crazy feminist overnight, that she was probably a lesbian now. They tried everything to get a reaction. Nothing. Aria just kept sitting with the girls, actually listening when they talked, not interrupting to defend male behavior. The girls were suspicious at first. This had to be some long con to gather gossip for the boys. But Aria never brought up the guys, never defended them. When Jade mentioned feeling uncomfortable about something her boyfriend said, Aria actually responded with, that's not okay. You deserve better. Everyone's jaws broke the floor. Then we all found out what happened, and it was so much worse than anyone imagined. Audrey revealed what she'd heard from her older brother, who went to college with Ethan's brother.

In the video, my husband and my son were with her, and my son was hugging her, saying he wished she could be his mother. I stared at my phone in complete shock, watching my eight year old tell another woman he wanted her as his mom. My birthday cake sat untouched on the in counter. 32 candles melted into colorful puddles of wax. The balloons I'd hung that morning mocked me from the ceiling. Instead of crying like the old me would have done, I did something that would change everything forever. I called my lawyer first. Jennifer, it's Paisley. I need those divorce papers we discussed last month. Tonight. I don't care what time it is, Paisley. It's almost 10 p m. What the hell happened? He's been secretly taking Ethan to see his ex girlfriend Marisa behind my back for months. I have video proof of everything. Jesus. I'll have the papers ready by morning. Then I called my bank's emergency hotline. Account freeze, credit cards canceled immediately. The joint savings we'd carefully built over 10 years of marriage locked down tighter than Fort Knox. By the time Marcus finally walked through our front door at midnight, smelling like her perfume, I had already filed for emergency custody, called a locksmith to change every lock in the house, and methodically packed All his belonging into black garbage bags lined up by the front door like a funeral procession. Hey, babe, sorry we're so ridiculously late tonight, he said casually, fumbling with his house key that no longer worked. Little Ethan fell asleep in the car again. He finally looked up from his phone and saw the divorce papers spread across our coffee table like evidence at a crime scene. How was your wonderful day with Marisa? I asked, my voice steady and cold as winter ice. His face went completely white. The color drained so fast I genuinely thought he might collapse and faint right there. Paisley, sweetheart, I can explain everything. It's really not what you think it is. Save your explanations for the judge tomorrow morning. You're officially served. I handed him the thick custody papers with trembling hands. His fingers shook violently as he read the emergency restraining order. Our son Ethan appeared in the doorway, rubbing his sleepy eyes, still wearing the expensive new jacket I'd never seen before in my life. Mom, what's happening? Why are all of Dad's sitting outside in bags? Your father forgot it was my birthday today, honey. But he certainly remembered to take you to see his ex girlfriend instead. Ethan's little face crumpled with confusion. She said she was just Dad's old friend from college. She bought me ice cream and told me. What exactly did she tell you, baby? That maybe someday we could all live together like one. Big, happy family. Marcus grabbed my arm desperately, his grip almost painful. You can't just destroy and tear our entire family apart over this one thing. I already did. Now the courts will decide who Ethan really belongs with. His confident smirk, the same one he'd worn for years whenever I questioned his suspicious late nights, vanished completely when he realized I wasn't the same naive woman who used to wait up for him every single night with dinner warming in the oven. Paisley, please be reasonable. We can work this whole thing out between us. Marissa honestly means absolutely nothing to me. I pulled out my phone and played the damming video again. Really? Because she apparently has

When my high school announced a complete meat ban last September, we thought it was a joke. Any student caught with meat products faces immediate suspension. Principal Harrison declared at Assembly, we're becoming a progressive, wellness campus. She'd installed actual security guards who would check for meat products in our bags. Even the cafeteria would only serve vegan options. This is about teaching sustainable living, she said, ignoring the groans from 1,800 teenagers. The football team nearly rioted. But we need protein for sports, they argued. Plants have protein. Doctor Harrison replied, fine, we'd play her game. But here's what Doctor Harrison didn't realize. She just declared war on teenagers who lived on chicken nuggets. And we were about to show her what happened when you messed with our food. On day one, Cleo came to school wearing what looked like a normal dress until you got close. She'd actually sewn together hundreds of beef jerky wrappers on it. Cleo, that's inappropriate! Doctor Harrison said during first period. Go change immediately. Cleo stood up slowly. Of course, Doctor Harrison. Then she pulled off the dress to reveal another outfit underneath, a shirt with a giant photo of a T bone steak. Whole class erupted. Doctor Harrison's face went red. Office now! The Cleo sacrifice had inspired everyone. The next day, Tommy walked into school carrying a chicken. An actual live chicken. What is that? Doctor Harrison shrieked, running into the hallway. Colonel Sanders, Tommy said calmly, using a stack of papers, he's my emotional support animal. Here's the documentation from my therapist. She grabbed the papers, reading frantically. This. This can't be real. Call my therapist if you want, Tommy said. The chicken promptly pooped on her shoe. She couldn't refuse, since it was all legitimate. Within a week, 10 different students had emotional support chickens. The hallways were literal chaos from all their poop and screaming. I watched Doctor Harrison chase one through the cafeteria while it knocked over trash cans. Whose chicken is this? She screamed. That's Mcnugget, someone yelled. The second week was even worse. The chemistry club claimed they were doing an experiment on artificial flavoring when smoke started pouring from their lab. But really, they were trying to release a special scent. And it worked. Within minutes, the entire school reeked of bacon. Every protein scanner in the building went haywire, beeping non stop. What did you do? Doctor Harrison burst into the chemistry room. It's just artificial scent molecules, Jennifer said innocently. We're studying esters. Smell was so strong that parents called asking why their kids came home smelling like breakfast. Then Dante turned his locker into a black market deli. I watched him slip a piece of beef jerky to a freshman for $5. That's insane, I said. Buy and demand. He shrugged. I'm the only supplier. He got caught the next day when Doctor Harrison personally searched his locker. Three day suspension. She screamed, holding Up a bag of jerky like evidence in a murder trial. Dante walked out with his head high. Someone started a free Dante chant. Doctor Harrison was falling apart. Then came Spirit Week's International Food Day. At exactly 12 p m. Decks, our quarterback, stood on the center cafeteria table holding a three foot party sub packed with every meat imaginable. This is for everyone tired of eating grass, he shouted, taking a massive bite. Doctor Harrison burst through the doors, screaming, immediate expulsion! But then Raven stood up with a bucket of KFC. Mike pulled out Big Macs. Within seconds, 200 students had revealed hidden meat in a coordinated protest. Doctor Harrison grabbed the intercom, shrieking, lockdown! Freeze! But the art students released 50 remote control

The moment he walked through the door, the entire hallway went silent. Active shooter drill, everyone. Someone shouted, and half the students hit the floor while the others laughed. Killian just kept walking while people filmed him. By lunch, there were already three different TikTok box of him. They found pipe bombs in his locker. My friend Alex told me my brother was here when it happened. Said Killian had a whole hit list and escape routes. The teachers weren't subtle, either. During attendance, Mr. Williams made Killian stand up and empty his backpack for random security check. When Killian pulled out a calculator in AP Physics. This is a Kring. Actually flinched. The security guard followed him between every single class. Parents had already started a petition to remove him, which had 800 signatures by second period. But I started noticing things that didn't add up. Killian left granola bars on the desk of this kid whose parents couldn't afford lunch money. When some sophomores were destroying a special needs kids art project, Killian stepped between them. He tutored ESL students after school in the library. He carried tampons in his backpack because the school never restock the bathroom. Girls would slip him notes, he'd slip them back supplies. But nobody ever thanked him. They just took what they needed and went back to posting about how much Of a monster he was. It all shifted the day I stayed late for drama rehearsal. It was 6 p m. School was empty except for theater kids in the auditorium. I went out the back exit for fresh air and saw Mister Rayner, our AP history teacher, walking with Lacey, a freshman from my bus. They were heading toward the parking lot, and something about how she was walking, shoulders hunched, arms wrapped around herself made my stomach twist. I got up to them and hid behind the bushes to listen. You need extra tutoring at my house. I heard Mister Rayner tell her. Your grades really need special attention. Lacey looked terrified. I should call my mom. I already told her you'd be staying late for academic help. His hand was on her lower back, pushing her toward his car. She was thrilled. You're getting personal assistance. I was about to pull out my phone, but that's when Killian appeared from behind the dumpsters. Lacey, your mom's here to pick you up, he said calmly. She's in the front lot. Mister Rayner's face went dark. Miss Killian, Lacy's with me. We have a scheduled session. No, you don't! Killian stepped between them. Lacy, go to the front. Your mom's in the blue Honda. Lacy ran. She goddamn sprinted. Mr. Rayner grabbed Killian's shoulder. You have no idea what you're interfering with. I've been helping struggling students for fifteen years. Private tutoring, academic support. Principal Davies knows all about My methods? I know exactly what your methods are. Killian said. I've been documenting them for two years. You. Rayner laughed. School shooter. Who's going to believe you? He walked away. Which is when I finally stepped out. The next day, Killian and I went to Principal Davies. We told him everything we saw. But he leaned back in his chair and smiled. Mr. Rayner is our most decorated teacher. Thirty year veteran, coach of the year. His private tutoring has helped hundreds of struggling students. He looked at Killian. You're a convicted criminal who planned to murder children. And now you're stalking our best teacher. Then he turned to me. And you're believing a school shooter over a man who shaped young minds for decades? I think you both need psychological evaluation. He picked up his phone. Security, I need Killian escorted off campus. He's having delusions again. Killian stood up slowly. How many kids, Davies? How many kids did you send to his house knowing what he was? Get out before I call your Parole officer. That night, someone posted AI generated photo

When my son was 11, his school bus crashed, and his neck was whiplashed so hard that his airway was crushed. The doctors told us he would recover, but he might never speak again. But this didn't stop his younger sister, Rosie, from talking his ear off. Nathan would listen, smile, or even text responses back. Usually she's okay with that, but one time, when she came home from a bad day at school, she immediately ran to Nathan, and when he just patted her back in response, she whispered, I just wish you could tell me it'll be okay. Nathan spent a lot more time alone after that, and whenever I walked into his room to check on him, he would asleep under the covers. I figured it was just soccer practice tiring him out. And then came Rosie's seventh birthday party. Right after she blew out the candles, Nathan lifted his hand up and the room went silent. I was confused because this was usually something he did when something was wrong, but everything seemed fine. He then took a deep breath, his face turned red, and spoke the words, happy Birthday, Rosie. Me and Rosie both burst into tears before grabbing him for a big hug. And that's when I realized all those nights he spent alone, he was forcing out sounds and pushing through the pain, all for this moment. Rosie was Jumping up and down like she was on a trampoline and repeating the words. Nathan, you talked. You really talked. Nathan just smiled. His voice still raw, but his eyes brighter than I've seen in years. Because for the first time since the accident, he wasn't just listening. He was heard.

My neighbor has six kids and I've never met a single one. The first time they left one of their blackout curtains open, I caught sight of all six sitting around the kitchen table eating just chicken and rice while the parents were eating a Turkey dinner. I tried to tell myself it was just a new parenting trend. But over the next few weeks, I started noticing other things. The house was always quiet, not a peep. When I tried to make friendly neighbor conversation with the parents, I'd give one word answers and hurry inside. My best friend said I needed to stop being nosy. Some families are private, she said. Remember the rednecks? They were weird, but their kids turned out fine. But I'd raised three kids of my own and nothing about that house felt fine. It was 2 a. M. When my dog started barking at something outside. I jumped to the window and saw all six kids marching in their backyard like tiny soldiers. The father stood watching with his arms crossed while the mother blew a sharp whistle that made them all freeze again. Do it again until it's perfect, the father barked. The children immediately resumed their positions and started over. When one of the smaller ones stumbled, all six had to start again from the beginning. The next night, I deliberately stayed up to watch. Sure enough, 2:00am came and there they were. Again, this time doing jumping jacks in unison while quietly chanting something I couldn't make out. It sounded like the American Pledge of allegiance but distorted. The youngest couldn't have been older than 5 years old. Struggling to keep up, exhausted, I started paying closer attention to anyone who might have seen these kids, which is when the Amazon delivery driver whispered to me, those kids scat. They're like roaches when the porch light comes on. Never seen anything like it. A quick search online showed the parents weren't registered as homeschoolers in our state. Despite the kids never leaving the house, I started documenting everything with my phone. One night, I caught them all doing wall sits against the house at 3 a. M, their legs shaking from exhaustion while the mother timed them with a stopwatch. The next morning, I followed their grocery delivery to see what they were feeding these exhausted children. The shopkeeper noticed me watching and said they order the exact same thing every week, 40 pounds of rice, cases of protein powder and beans. Nothing a kid would want. That Tuesday, I was ready with my camera when I saw headlights approaching the it's filed into the white van silently. The license plate was conveniently covered with MUD. I sat on my kitchen floor for two hours while on hold with 9 1 1 until the van returned. Each child walked out wearing a different outfit than before, looking dazed. The youngest was limping. One boy had fresh bruises on his legs that weren't there before. I took a photo of each of their faces and breathed a sigh of relief. I finally had enough evidence to call CPS. They picked up on the 11th ring. I need someone to check on the family now next door. I think these children are being abused. There was a long pause. Ma'am, we've already done three home visits on that house. They're just a strict family. Please stop calling or we'll have to report you for harassment. Well, I was done asking for permission. I waited until I saw the parents leave one morning and snuck into their backyard. The garage side door was unlocked. My heart hammered so hard I could hear it in my ears. But those kids needed someone to fight for them. I pushed the door open and stepped inside.

He'd calculated that if he could prove I cheated and devastated him publicly, he could claim emotional trauma and financial losses. I found audio recordings of our private conversations going back months. He been secretly documenting everything, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. The Christmas party proposal was absolutely perfect. Maximum witnesses, maximum humiliation, maximum evidence of his devastation for court. I took everything to my family's lawyer immediately. The recordings alone were a felony. Recording someone without consent is illegal in our state. The fake evidence constituted fraud. The public defamation. That

I thought I was imagining things at first. Me and my girlfriend Rachel were sitting on the living room floor with 10 month old Emma trying to get her to say anything. You know how it is with babies. You make all those stupid faces and weird sounds hoping they'll copy you. Rachel was doing the classic mama, mama, mama thing while waving her hands around like a complete maniac. I was on the other side doing my best dad voice going Dada, Dada, come on, sweetie. Emma just sat there in her little pink onesie chewing on her fingers and staring at us like we were the biggest idiots on the planet, which let's be honest, we probably were. Then my phone buzzed with another YouTube notification. I've been binge watching this tech review channel all week and apparently I'd forgotten to turn off notifications. Without thinking, I grabbed my phone and set out. God, I need to unsubscribe from this guy. Emma's head snapped toward me. Her eyes went wide. Then clear as day she looked right at me and said unsubscribe. Perfect pronunciation, three syllables like she'd been practicing. Rachel stopped mid mama and stared. I dropped my phone. We both looked at Emma who had this huge grin on her face like she knew she'd just blown our minds. She clapped her little hands together and said it again, unsubscribe. Pediatrician told us it was Perfectly normal. Kids pick up whatever words they hear most often. And apparently I've been saying unsubscribe way more than either Mama or Dada. That week, Rachel was not happy. She kept giving me these dirty looks like it was somehow my fault our daughter's first word was a YouTube feature instead of something sweet and meaningful. But here's where it gets weird. Emma became obsessed with that word. She he'd crawl around the house saying unsubscribe to everything, the cat, her toys, the TV. When she was hungry, instead of crying, she'd look at her empty bottle and say unsubscribe like she was canceling her milk subscription. Two weeks later, I'm at target with Emma in the cart. He's being super good, just sitting there playing with her little stuffed elephant. Then this random lady walks up, you know the type, the one who thinks every baby in public belongs to everyone. She starts making baby talk at Emma, doing that high pitched voice thing. Oh, what a cute little girl. Can you say hi to me, sweetie? Can you wave? Emma looks at this lady for a second, tilts her head and then says in the clearest voice ever, unsubscribe. Lady's face went from sweet grandma mode to completely confused. She looked at me like I'd taught my baby to curse at strangers. I just shrugged and said she's very selective about her content. But the real kicker came last month. Rachel's mom was over for dinner and She's always been one of those people who thinks she knows better than everyone about everything. She kept trying to feed Emma these organic baby food pouches that cost like $5 each, going on and on about how regular baby food is full of chemicals and we're poisoning our child. Emma was in her high chair, completely ignoring the fancy organic carrot puree her grandma was trying to shove in her mouth. She kept turning her head away and making this annoyed face. Finally, after about 10 minutes of this back and forth, Emma looked her grandma dead in the eye and said, unsubscribe. With the most serious expression I've ever seen on a baby. Rachel's mom stopped mid spoon and asked what she said. Emma said it again, louder this time, unsubscribe. I started laughing so hard I almost choked on my pasta. Rachel was trying not to laugh, but I could see her shoulders shaking. Her mom looked absolutely mortified, like Emma had just told her to get lost in the rudest way possible, which honestly, she kind of had. Emma had figured out that unsubscribe meant I don't want this anymore and she was using it to opt out of situations she didn't like. It was actually brilliant.

In the video, my husband and my son were with her. And my son was hugging her, saying he wished she could be his mother. I stared at my phone in complete shock, watching my eight year old tell another woman he wanted her as his mom. My birthday cake sat untouched on the kitchen counter. Thirty two candles melted into colorful puddles of wax. The balloons I'd hung that morning mocked me from the ceiling. Instead of crying like the old me I've done, I did something that would change everything forever. I called my lawyer first. Jennifer, it's Paisley. I need those divorce papers we discussed last month. Tonight. I don't care what time it is, Paisley. It's almost ten PM. What the hell happened? He. I've been secretly taking Ethan to see his ex girlfriend Marisa behind my back for months. I have video proof of everything. Jesus. I'll have the papers ready by morning. Then I called my bank's emergency hotline. Account freeze, credit cards canceled immediately. The joint savings we'd carefully built over 10 years of marriage locked down tighter than Fort Knox. By the time Marcus finally walked through our front door at midnight, smelling like her perfume, I had already filed for emergency custody, called a locksmith, change every lock in the house, and methodically packed all His belongings into black garbage bags lined up by the front door like a funeral procession. Hey, babe, sorry so ridiculously late tonight, he said casually, fumbling with his house key that no longer worked. Little Ethan fell asleep in the car again. He finally looked up from his phone and saw the divorce papers spread across our coffee table like evidence at a crime scene. How was your wonderful day with Marissa? I asked, voice steady and cold as winter ice. His face went completely white. The color drained so fast I genuinely thought he might collapse and faint right there. Paisley, sweetheart, I can explain everything. It's really not what you think it is. Save your explanations for the judge tomorrow morning. You're officially served. I handed him the thick custody papers with trembling hands. His fingers shook violently as he read the emergency restraining order. Our son Ethan appeared in the doorway, rubbing his sleepy eyes, still wearing the expensive new jacket I'd never seen before in my life. Mom, what's happening? Why are all of Dad's sitting outside in bags? Your father forgot it was my birthday today, honey. But he certainly remembered to take you to see his ex girlfriend instead. Ethan's little face crumpled with confusion. She said she was just Dad's old friend from college. She bought me ice cream and told me. What exactly did she tell you, baby? That maybe someday we could all live together like one big happy family. Marcus grabbed my arm desperately, his grip almost painful. You can't just destroy and tear our entire family apart over this one thing. I already did. Now the courts will decide who Ethan really belongs with. His confident smirk, the same one he'd worn for years whenever I questioned his suspicious late nights, vanished completely when he realized I wasn't the same naive woman who used to wait up for him every single night with dinner warming in the oven. Paisley, please be reasonable. We can work this whole thing out between us. Marissa honestly means absolutely nothing to me. I pulled out my phone and played the damming video again. Really? Because she apparently has dozens of videos of you two together going back six months. Beach trips, romantic dinner dates, family photos with my son. How did you even. She sent it by complete accident. Meant to send it to her sis

There's this guy in my neighborhood who started stealing my packages about two months ago. At first I thought it was just bad luck when my new headphones went missing. Then my coffee maker disappeared, then a birthday gift for my mom. After the fourth theft, I started tracking delivery times, obsessively trying to grab packages the second they arrived. But this guy was watching, too. I'd check the delivery notification rush outside, five minutes later, and the package would already be gone. I saw him once. He was in his mid 30s, baseball cap, driving a beat up Toyota Corolla that he'd park one street over before walking to my house. He wasn't even subtle about it. He'd stroll up my driveway in broad daylight like he owned the place. I put up a no trespassing sign. He took that, too. I added a mile you're on camera sign even though I didn't have cameras yet. The next day, that sign was in my recycling bin. That's when things got personal. He started leaving sticky notes on my door after stealing packages. The first one said, thanks for the Bluetooth speaker, sucker, with a smiley face drawn on it. The next time, after taking my workout supplements, he left a note saying, maybe try working out your brain instead. He was taunting me when he stole my girlfriend's anniversary gift. He actually had the nerve to leave a note saying she's too good for someone who can't even protect a package. Nice choice on the earrings though. That one made my blood boil. I tried everything having packages delivered to my work, but my boss shut that down. Amazon lockers were always full. I asked neighbors to grab them, but they were during the day too. The worst part was when he stole my diabetic cat's special food delivery and left a note thanks for the feast, dummy. My cat had to go without his food for 3 days while I waited for a replacement. I was literally trapped. I couldn't order anything to my own home. This guy was controlling my life and he was enjoying every second of it. I finally hit my limit when he stole my grandmother's medication that I'd ordered for her. The note said Hope Granny's not in a rush. Lol that was it. I went to the police station with all the sticky notes as evidence. The officer took my report, said they'd investigate, and told me package theft was unfortunately common. They'd increase patrols, they said. They'd keep an eye out, they said. But we both knew nothing would happen. It was just petty theft to them, a property crime that wasn't worth resources. I went home furious and started researching my options online. My first thought was a glitter bomb or die pack, but then I found forums discussing package Protection. Turns out booby trapping packages is illegal. You can actually get sued or arrested for injuring a thief. Even a harmless glitter bomb could technically be considered assault. I was about to give up when I stumbled across a post from a lawyer explaining that tampering with federal mail is a serious federal crime, not just petty theft. Federal mail includes anything sent through USPS with proper postage. The penalties were severe, up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines. That's when my plan started forming. I invested in a high quality security camera system with clear night vision and motion detection, spending nearly $500 I couldn't really afford. I made sure one camera had a perfect angle of my driveway where cars would pass. Then I prepared my trap. I ordered a cheap item from eBay, but specifically requested USPS Priority Mail shipping. When it arrived, I carefully opened it from the bottom, keeping the federal mail label intact and visible. I placed the original

So I'm 23, oldest of five kids and basically running my parents house like I'm the damn manager or something. I'm in school full time getting my second degree, plus I work part time in my field. My employer already said they'll take me full time once I graduate. So I'm making decent money for a student, enough to pay for school and actually save some cash. My siblings are 20, 17, 14 and 10. My parents both work. Dad pulls crazy long hours and mom does the 9 to 5 grind at some stressful job. So guess who picks up all the slack? Me. I do literally everything. Grocery shopping every week, all the laundry for seven people, cooking dinner every single night and meal prep on Sunday so everyone has lunches ready. I even manage my siblings chores like making sure there's dog food in the pantry so my youngest brother can actually feed our two dogs or that we have poop bags on the leashes. It's like being a mom to four other people plus going to school. During Christmas break, I finally had enough saved up to buy myself a PS five. Been wanting one forever and I found one at regular price. But if you know anything about PS Fives in 2022 was basically winning the lottery. The rest of my family still shares this old PS four in the living room, but I Keep mine in my room. It's mine. I bought it and no, I don't share it. Well, my 20 year old brother Jake started whining to my parents about how unfair it was that I had all this money and cool stuff but wouldn't share. Like dude, get a job, but whatever. So my parents call me into the kitchen for this family meeting, which was basically them telling me I need to start paying rent. They said it wasn't fair that I was making good money while living there for free, especially when I won't even share my gaming console. I just sat there listening to them explain how much they wanted from me monthly. And I'm doing the math in my head. After rent I'd have maybe $800 left over each month. That's after buying my own food, gas, school supplies, everything. I went to my room and actually calculated it out on paper. If I dropped a couple classes next semester, I could go almost full time at work. It would only add one more year to my degree, but I could afford my own place. And here's the kicker, I'd actually have more free time and way more spending money than if I stayed home paying rent while doing everyone's chores. So I packed up my stuff. Everything I owned fit in my Honda Civic, which honestly was kind of depressing but also liberating. I didn't tell them I was leaving until I was loading my Car, where are you going? My mom asked standing in the driveway in her bathrobe. Getting my own place. Thanks for helping me realise I can afford it. I stayed at this Airbnb for 2 weeks while I figured out apartments, adjusted my class schedule and got more hours at work. The Airbnb host, this older lady named Beverly kept asking if I was okay because I was just so happy to be there. Like I was literally excited to do my own laundry and okay, I'm not gonna lie, I went a little crazy on dating apps. Living at home with four siblings and strict parents meant I hadn't had anyone over in like ever. Suddenly having my own space was like being let out of prison. I found this decent one bedroom apartment about 15 minutes from campus. Nothing fancy, but it has a dishwasher and in unit laundry, which felt like luxury after sharing one bathroom with six other people. The fallout was immediate. My parents had to give Jake all my old responsibilities. Poor guy went from just keeping his own room clean to grocery shopping, cooking dinner and managing everyone else's chores. The other three siblings got stuck with his old tasks split between them. Jake called me crying, literally crying because he had to break plans with his girlfriend Megan to meal prep for the week. Apparently mom and dad have this rule that girlfriends can't come over when they're not home. So he Couldn't even have her help. My 17 year old sister Emma texted me saying she now has to do laundry for 5 people every weekend and it's taking up her entire Saturday. The 14 year old has to walk both dogs twice a day instead of just feeding them. Even my 10 year old brother is mad because he has to help with dishes now. My parents kept calling saying I left them in the lurch and that I was being selfish. Dad actually said I was abandoning my family responsibilities, which was rich coming from someone who worked 12 hour days and never cooked a single meal. But here's the thing, I'm loving it. I bought myself a little succulent from IKEA and named it Gerald.

Can't have you scaring away the clientele anymore. I set down my gloves and left. My girlfriend was already prepared. Six hours later, the shop imploded. By evening, his voicemails turned to begging. I've been the lead artist at the local tattoo for four years. When I started, it was a dingy shop with expired ink and flash art nobody wanted. I transformed everything. Brought in proper autoclaves, designed custom this is that, got reposted thousands of times. Mentored apprentices who actually knew what cross contamination meant. Within eight months, my waitlist stretched two years out. When Bieber bought out his partner last September, everything changed. He'd make jokes about my type bringing down property values. He'd tell Walkins that maybe they'd be safer with Doug, the white kid he hired straight out of art school. When clients specifically requested me, Bieber would intercept them asking if they were sure they wanted to wait two years when Doug was available today. So on February 1st, Bieber called me into his office. A Confederate flag sticker peeked out from behind his filing cabinet. You're out, he said, feet up on his desk. Can't have you scaring away the clientele anymore. I stood there, still wearing my latex gloves from the session, watching him pick at his teeth with a business card. Doug can handle your books. He was always more talented than you. Anyway, Doug, who didn't know the difference between a mag and a round liner, right? I pulled off my gloves, set them on the sharps container and left. Didn't pack my drawings. Didn't say goodbye to my clients waiting outside. I'd just walked past the flash sheets I designed. My girlfriend Amara was assembling equipment in our garage when I got home. Beaver finally said the quiet part out loud. She asked when she saw me looking defeated. Said I was scaring away clientele. Her grin widened. Good. I've been waiting for this. Amara, I'm unemployed. The mortgage isn't going to pay itself. She turned her laptop toward me. That investment banker who's dragging back piece you finished last month. She's been emailing for weeks. Wants you to do her entire trading team before their company gala. Bieber intercepted everything. The email thread showed five executives each wanting elaborate pieces. 30,000 for two weeks work. She'd already reserved a private medical suite downtown for the sessions. My phone started buzzing. Bieber. I ignored it. Then Doug called, then the apprentice. Within minutes, I had 52 missed calls. Amara's phone rang. Her cousin worked at the emergency room. Bieber's shop. Put her on speaker. I said, Malik, you need to know what's happening. We've got four of Bieber's clients here. That new guy, Doug. He's been mixing expired ink with tap water to stretch supplies. The infections are severe. The first victim was a judge's daughter getting her law school graduation. Tattoo. Doug had attempted Lady Justice on her forearm. According to the nurse, the scales looked like scrambled eggs, the sword like a butter knife. The inflammation was spreading up her arm. My phone wouldn't stop. Bieber's voicemails grew increasingly frantic. First message, small hiccup here. Could use your input. Second, Malik, there's been an incident. Third, the health inspector is asking questions I can't answer. Amara's cousin called back an hour later. The judge's daughter's father just showed up. He's calling the health department, the medical board, his attorney. He saw the tattoo. Doug spelled justice wrong. More updates trickled in. Doug had attempted a

I stared at that crumpled twenty and two tens like they were aliens. My daughter Emma was only 7, and I had no clue whose kid I was supposedly feeding. The handwriting was neat, definitely an adult's. And the note was on some fancy stationery with little flowers on it. When Emma got home from school, I showed her the money and asked what was going on. She just shrugged and said, oh, that's from Becca's mom. Becca doesn't have lunch money this week, so I've been sharing my sandwich. My heart melted a little, but I was also confused. Why didn't this mom just pack her own kid lunch? The next morning, I decided to pack extra food just in case. Two sandwiches, two juice boxes, extra crackers. Emma didn't even question it. She just smiled and said, thanks, Dad. Becca will be so happy. I dropped her off at school and went to work, but I couldn't stop thinking about this Becca kid. That afternoon, I got a call from the school. Mister Williams, we need to discuss something with you about Emma. My stomach dropped. Did she get in trouble? Did something happen? I rushed over there expecting the worst. The principal, Missus Davis, sat me down in her office with this weird look on her face. Your daughter has been bringing extra food every day. This week and sharing with a classmate. We normally don't allow food sharing because of allergies, but we wanted to talk to you about the situation. First, she explained that Becca's family was going through a rough patch. Her mom worked three jobs but still couldn't afford school lunches. They'd applied for the free lunch program, but there was a waiting list. Meanwhile, Becca had been sitting at lunch with nothing but a water bottle. Emma apparently noticed on Monday and just started splitting everything in half, her sandwich, her apple slices, her cookies. She'd even been giving Becca her juice box and drinking from the water fountain instead. I was proud of my daughter but also heartbroken. No kid should go hungry at school. I told Missus Davis I wanted to keep packing extra food until Becca's free lunch kicked in. He smiled and said that would be fine, but mentioned that Becca's mom had been trying to find me to pay me back. That evening, there was a knock on our door. A woman in scrubs stood there looking exhausted. Are you Emma's dad? She asked nervously. I'm Janet, Becca's mom. I work at the hospital downtown. She looked like she hadn't slept in days. She pulled out a worn envelope and tried to hand it to me. I know $40 isn't enough for all the food Emma's been sharing, but it's all I have right now. I get paid again on Friday. Her voice was shaking and I could see she was embarrassed. I gently push the envelope back toward her. Keep it. Emma wants to share and we have plenty. Janet started crying right there on my doorstep. She explained that her husband had left six months ago, stuck her with all the debt, and she was working as a nurse aid cleaning lady and doing Doordash at night just to pay rent. That's when I had an idea. What time do you get home from your hospital job? I asked. Usually around 5:30, she said, wiping her eyes. Would you and Becca like to come over for dinner tonight? Emma would love to have her friend over. Janet looked shocked. I can't ask you to do that, but I insisted. An hour later, she showed up with Becca, a shy little girl with the brightest smile. The kids ran off to play while Janet and I talked in the kitchen. Turns out Janet was actually a registered nurse, but the only full time position she could find was across town with terrible hours. She'd been applying everywhere but kept getting rejected. I mentioned that my company's medical office was hiring nurses and their hours were perfect for single parents. Two weeks later, Janet got the job. She was able to quit her other two jobs and actually be home with Becca in the evenings.

And here's the kicker, I'd actually have more free time and way more spending money than if I stayed home paying rent while doing everyone's chores. So I packed up my stuff. Everything I owned fit in my Honda Civic, which honestly was kind of depressing but also liberating. I didn't tell them I was leaving until I was loading my Car, where are you going? My mom asked standing in the driveway in her bathrobe. Getting my own place. Thanks for helping me realise I can afford it. I stayed at this Airbnb for 2 weeks while I figured out apartments, adjusted my class schedule and got more hours at work. The Airbnb host, this older lady named Beverly kept asking if I was okay because I was just so happy to be there. Like I was literally excited to do my own laundry and okay, I'm not gonna lie, I went a little crazy on dating apps. Living at home with four siblings and strict parents meant I hadn't had anyone over in like ever. Suddenly having my own space was like being let out of prison. I found this decent one bedroom apartment about 15 minutes from campus. Nothing fancy, but it has a dishwasher and in unit laundry, which felt like luxury after sharing one bathroom with six other people. The fallout was immediate. My parents had to give Jake all my old responsibilities. Poor guy went from just keeping his own room clean to grocery shopping, cooking dinner and managing everyone else's chores. The other three siblings got stuck with his old tasks split between them. Jake called me crying, literally crying because he had to break plans with his girlfriend Megan to meal prep for the week. Apparently mom and dad have this rule that girlfriends can't come over when they're not home. So he Couldn't even have her help. My 17 year old sister Emma texted me saying she now has to do laundry for 5 people every weekend and it's taking up her entire Saturday. The 14 year old has to walk both dogs twice a day instead of just feeding them. Even my 10 year old brother is mad because he has to help with dishes now. My parents kept calling saying I left them in the lurch and that I was being selfish. Dad actually said I was abandoning my family responsibilities, which was rich coming from someone who worked 12 hour days and never cooked a single meal. But here's the thing, I'm loving it. I bought myself a little succulent from IKEA and named it Gerald.

So I gave him the 1950s housewife he wanted. I had been with Craig for three years when he completely ruined my promotion dinner at this fancy Italian place downtown. Women today are the problem with everything, he said, twirling his pasta. They don't know how to be real women anymore. They're always trying to wear the pants, competing with men instead of serving them. My grandpa had it right. His woman stayed home, cooked his meals, and didn't talk back. My wine glass stopped halfway to my mouth. Craig, we are literally here to celebrate my promotion. That's exactly what I mean. You care more about your stupid job than making me happy. Back in the day, women knew their place and kept their man satisfied. I looked around the restaurant where we were supposed to be celebrating my success. So you want a traditional relationship? Like the actual 1950s? His eyes lit up. Finally you get it. Yes. A real woman who acts like a woman should, the way god intended. Okay, traditional it is. He reached over to grab my hand. See, I knew you would understand. Most women would get all feminist and defensive about this. The next morning, I showed up to breakfast in a full 1950s housewife outfit, complete with pearls and a puffy dress that covered my ankles. Good morning, Mister. Anderson, I said, putting his coffee down. He laughed. Okay, the outfit is cute. But you don't have to call me that. Oh, but I do. In the 1950s, a proper lady always addresses her man respectfully. His smile started to fade that evening when he wanted to go to his friend's party. I shook my head. Oh, no, Mr. Anderson. I can't share a car with you. We're not married. People would think I'm a prostitute. What? That's insane. In the 1950s, unmarried couples needed chaperones. I will have to take the bus and meet you there. The bus? Just get in the car. That would make me a loose woman, Mister Anderson. He had to explain to everyone at the party why we arrived separately. At the party, his friend Kyle asked about my promotion. I turned to Craig. May I answer him, Mister Anderson? Craig's face went red. Just talk to him. As you wish. I turned to Kyle. Mister Anderson doesn't believe women should work. I will be quitting my job soon to focus on cooking and cleaning like a real woman. My mother failed to teach me that my only value is serving a man. Kyle nearly choked on his beer. Dude, what the hell? She's being stupid. Craig muttered. No. Mister Anderson believes modern women are broken. We think we deserve Equality when we should be grateful men even put up with us. I sat quietly, hands folded, only speaking when Craig gave permission. His friends kept staring at him. The real entertainment started at his company picnic. When his boss's wife asked about my job, I smiled sweetly. Mister Anderson says careers make women forget how to be women. Would you like my potato salad recipe instead? It's the only thing I'm for. I spent the entire event walking three steps behind Craig, staring at the ground, calling him Mr. Anderson, and asking his permission for everything. May I have a hot dog, Mr. Anderson? Just the damn hot dog. Is that a yes? I need you to say yes or no. His co workers started whispering. When someone asked why I kept calling him Mr. Anderson, I explained happily. Craig says modern women destroyed society by thinking they're equal to men. He wanted a traditional 1950s relationship where I knew my place. His boss overheard Craig. Did you really say that? She's twisting my words. Craig growled, oh, no. Mister Anderson was very clear. He said women should shut up, stay home, and give men sex on demand. The boss's face went ice cold. HR will want to discuss this on Monday, Craig. By Week 3, Craig was cracking. Can we please have sex? He asked one night. I gasped, clutching my pearls. Literally, Mister Anderson, good girls don't do that before marriage. What would Jesus think? We have been having sex for three years. That was the old me. The new traditional me saves herself for marriage. He punched a pillow. Then came his mother's birthday dinner at Craig's favorite steakhouse. When the waiter came, Over. I handed him my menu immediately. Mr. Anderson will order for me. Ladies don't talk to other men. Craig's mom's jaw dropped. Craig, what is going on? Your son wanted a traditional 1950s relationship, I explained, looking down shyly. He says modern women ruined everything by having jobs and

There's this guy in my neighborhood who started stealing my packages about two months ago. At first I thought it was just bad luck when my new headphones went missing. Then my coffee maker disappeared, then a birthday gift for my mom. After the fourth theft, I started tracking delivery times obsessively, trying to grab package is the second they arrived. But this guy was watching, too. I'd check the delivery notification rush outside, five minutes later, and the package would already be gone. I saw him once. He was in his mid 30s, baseball cap, driving a beat up Toyota Corolla that he'd park one street over before walking to my house. He wasn't even subtle about it. He'd stroll up my driveway in broad daylight like he owned the place. I put up a no trespassing sign. He took that, too. I added a smile you're on camera sign even though I didn't have cameras yet. The next day, that sign was in my recycling bin. That's when things got personal. He started leaving sticky notes on my door after stealing packages. The first one said, thanks for the Bluetooth speaker, sucker, with a smiley face drawn on it. The next time, after taking my workout supplements, he left a note saying, maybe try working out your brain instead. He was taunting me when he stole my girlfriend's anniversary gift. He actually had the nerve to leave a note saying she's too good for someone who can't even protect a package. Nice choice on the earrings though. That one made my blood boil. I tried everything having packages delivered to my work, but my boss shut that down. Amazon lockers were always full. I asked neighbors to grab them, but they work during the day too. The worst part was when he stole my diabetic cat's special food delivery and left a note. Thanks for the feast, dummy. My cat had to go without his prescription food for three days while I waited for a replacement. I was literally trapped. I. I didn't order anything to my own home. This guy was controlling my life and he was enjoying every second of it. I finally hit my limit when he stole my grandmother's medication that I'd ordered for her. The note said Hope Granny's not in a rush. Lol. That was it. I went to the police station with all the sticky notes as evidence. The officer took my report, said they'd investigate, and told me package theft was unfortunately common. They'd increase patrols, they said. They'd keep an eye out, they said. But we both knew nothing would happen. It was just petty theft to them, a property crime that wasn't worth their resources. I went home furious and started researching my options online. My first thought was a glitter bomb or dye pack, but then I found forums. Discussing package protect. Turns out booby trapping packages is illegal. You can actually get sued or arrested for injuring a thief. Even a harmless glitter bomb could technically be considered assault. I was about to give up when I stumbled across a post from a lawyer explaining that tampering with federal mail is a serious federal crime, not just petty theft. Federal mail includes anything sent through USPS with proper postage. The penalties were severe, up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines. That's when my plan started forming. I invested in a high quality security camera system with clear night vision and motion detection, spending nearly $500 I couldn't really afford. I made sure one camera had a perfect angle of my driveway where cars would pass. Then I prepared my trap. I ordered a cheap item from eBay, but specifically requested USPS Priority Mail shipping. When it arrived, I carefully opened it from the bottom, keeping the federal mail label intact and visible. I placed the original item inside a larger Amazon box, then put that Amazon box inside another package, making it look like a typical Amazon delivery. But underneath, clearly visible if anyone looked was that USPS label.

Meet my French husband and waste your time. So my mom and I were in Paris last month, and she just told me this absolutely legendary story that I had to share. My mom is like the nicest person alive to strangers, especially sales people. She's the type who will stand there for an hour listening to some pushy sales person because she doesn't wanna be rude. My dad passed away a few years back, but he was born in Egypt and spoke perfect French and Arabic before learning English when he moved to the U S. Back in 1976, when my parents were newlyweds, they took a trip to Paris. My mom collects stamps, which I know sounds super nerdy, but whatever. She wanted to buy some French plate blocks for her collection and was planning to drop like, three or four hundred dollars, which was a lot of money back then. She. She left my dad napping at the hotel and walked to this post office about a block away. The line was insanely long, but she waited patiently because that's just how she is. When she finally got to the front counter, the woman behind it looked at her and said in perfect English that she didn't speak English. My mom was confused, but okay, whatever. Maybe she misunderstood. So she waited for another employee to become free. This took forever, and when the second woman finally became available, she Was straight up nasty to my mom, rolling her eyes, telling her she couldn't help her, couldn't sell her, this was out of stock. Of that, just being completely rude and dismissive. My mom said she was almost in tears because she couldn't understand why this woman was being so mean when she was just trying to buy stamps. But here's where it gets good. My mom is usually a pushover, but something about this situation just set her off. She decided she was going to get revenge. She walked back to the hotel and woke up my dad, who was still taking his nap. She explained what happened and asked him to come with her to the post office. They got back there, and my mom waited until that same rude woman was available. Then she had my dad start talking to the woman in perfect French. He told her that my mom wanted the plate block from every single set of stamps they had in the entire post office. Woman's attitude completely changed when she realized my dad spoke fluent French. But she had already been caught being terrible, so she couldn't really back out. For those who don't know stamps, when you remove the plate block from a sheet, the remaining stamps have to be counted by hand, one by one. It's super tedious and time consuming. The woman had to go through every single stamp design they had and remove the plate blocks. She was pulling Them from sheet after sheet, making this huge stack while my dad and mom just stood there watching. This went on for, like, 30 minutes. The woman kept glancing at the clock because it was getting close to closing time. She had plate blocks from literally every stamp design in the entire post office stacked up on the counter. It was probably

Cassidy dumped me for my best friend Braden at prom entrance. And it turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to me. Which I didn't know was that I'd already spent $400 on matching burgundy outfits she begged for. Can't January. I've been working doubles at a pizza joint every weekend. Had her dad's blessing to ask her to be my prom queen. Even practice my speech in the car during lunch breaks like an idiot. But when I showed up at her house that Friday night in the burgundy tux for sale, shaking in my hands, her mom's face told me everything. Honey, she already left with Braden. I sat on the porch with my head in my heads when I realized what was happening. But I drove to the venue anyway, thinking maybe her mom was confused. Nope. I found them at the entrance. Cassidy wearing the burgundy dress I bought, but with his cheap gold corsage on her wrist. She looked at me with zero emotion. Braden and I have been together for months. You were too busy with college applications to notice. Then my best friend, the guy who'd help me pick her corsage that morning, actually said, thanks for keeping her warm, bro. I handed my sixty dollar corsage to some terrified freshman girl stand nearby and walked into prom alone the whole time. I kept thinking about that Stanford scholarship I've been planning to decline to stay near her. Maybe I didn't have to anymore. As soon as I walked in, something strange happened. People started surrounding me. Not with pity, but actual anger at them. My younger sister dragged me to the dance floor. Everyone saw what they did. Everyone thinks they're trash. Then I saw Cassidy standing by the punch bowl by herself, pretending to text. Someone grabbed my hand right then. It was Brandon's ex. He's outside with someone else right now. He's been playing Cassidy since day one, just like he did with me. We danced a bit while Cassidy watched from across the room, her face getting redder with each song. Things got crazy, though when they announced Prom Court and the DJ actually called my name for king. The entire gym went bomb bonkers. Cassidy didn't even make court, despite campaigning for months with homemade cookies and promises. She tried to hug me during the crowning, but I walked past her to dance with the Queen. Things were only going to get better, though. Everyone went to a huge after party, where I met this cute girl from another high school. I couldn't believe that she was also heading to Stanford for pre med. She also couldn't stop laughing at my story about getting dumped at the door, which made me like her more, to be honest. We talked until sunrise about everything except Cassidy. Meanwhile, Braden Had returned from wherever he was, and Cassidy left crying when she saw lipstick on his collar. Her best friend told me later that she'd been posting and deleting messages all night, trying to make it look like she was having fun. Three weeks later, my phone wouldn't stop buzzing. At two in the morning, 27 messages from Cassidy. I went to his house, and another girl answered the door. He's been with three other people this whole time. You were the only real thing I had. The funny thing was, Cassidy thought she was upgrading when she

Can't have you scaring away the clientele anymore. I set down my gloves and left. My girlfriend was already prepared. Six hours later, the shop imploded. By evening, his voicemails turned to begging. I've been the lead artist at the local tattoo for four years. When I started, it was a dingy shop with expired ink and flash art nobody wanted. I transformed everything. Brought in proper autoclaves, designed custom pieces that got reposted thousands of times, mentored apprentices who actually knew what cross contamination meant. Within eight months, my wait list stretched two years out. But when Bieber bought out his partner last September, everything changed. He'd make jokes about my type bringing down property values. He'd tell Walkins that maybe they'd be safer with Doug, the white kid he hired right out of art school. When clients specifically requested me, Bieber would intercept them, asking if they were sure they wanted to wait two years when Doug was available today. So on February 1st, Bieber called me into his office. A Confederate flag sticker peeked out from behind his filing cabinet. You're out, he said, feet up on his desk. Can't have you scaring away the clientele anymore. I still there, still wearing my latex gloves from the session, watching him pick at his teeth with a business card. Doug can handle your books. He was always more talented than you anyway. Doug, who didn't know the difference Between a mag and a round liner. Right. I pulled off my gloves, set them on the sharps container and left. Didn't pack my drawings. Didn't say goodbye to my clients waiting outside. Just walked past the flash sheets I designed. My girlfriend Amara was assembling equipment in our garage when I got home. Bieber finally said the quiet part out loud. She asked when she saw me looking defeated. Said I was scaring away clientele. Her grin widened. Good. I've been waiting for this. Amara, I'm unemployed. The mortgage isn't going to pay itself. She turned her laptop toward me. That investment banker who's dragging back you finished last month. She's been emailing for weeks. Wants you to do her entire trading team before their company gala. Bieber intercepted everything. The email thread showed five executives each wanting elaborate pieces. 30,000 for two weeks work. She'd already reserved a private medical suite downtown for the sessions. My phone started buzzing. Bieber. I ignored it. Then Doug called, then the apprentice. Within minutes, I had 52 missed calls. Amara's phone rang. Her cousin worked at the emergency room. Your Bieber's shop. Put her on speaker. I said, Malik, you need to know what's happening. We've got four of Bieber's clients here. That new guy, Doug. He's been mixing expired ink with tap water to stretch supplies. The infections are severe. The first victim was a judge's daughter getting her law school graduation tattoo. Doug had attempted Lady Justice on her. Forearm. According to the nurse, the scales looked like scrambled eggs. The sword like a butter knife. The inflammation was spreading up her arm. My phone wouldn't stop. Bieber's voicemails grew increasingly frantic. First message, small hiccup here. Could use your input. Second, Malik, there's been an incident. Third, the health inspector is asking questions I can't answer. Amara's cousin called back an hour later. The judge

So I gave him the 1950s housewife he wanted. I have been with Craig for three years when he completely ruined my promotion dinner at this fancy Italian place downtown. Women today are the problem with everything, he said, twirling his pasta. They don't know how to be real women anymore. They're always trying to wear the pants, competing with men instead of serving them. My grandpa had it right. His woman stayed home, cooked his meals, and didn't talk back. My wine glass stopped halfway to my mouth. Craig, we are literally here to sell. Rate my promotion. That's exactly what I mean. You care more about your stupid job than making me happy. Back in the day, women knew their place and kept their man satisfied. I looked around the restaurant where we were supposed to be celebrating my success. So you want a traditional relationship, like the actual 1950s? His eyes lit up. Finally you get it. Yes. A real woman who acts like a woman should, the way god intended. Okay, traditional it is. Reached over to grab my hand. See? I knew you would understand. Most women would get all feminist and defensive about this. The next morning, I showed up to breakfast in a full 1950s housewife outfit, complete with pearls and a puffy dress that covered my ankles. Good morning, Mr. Anderson, I said, putting his coffee down. He laughed. Okay, the outfit is cute, but you don't Have to call me that. Oh, but I do. In the 1950s, a proper lady always addresses her man respectful. His smile started to fade. That evening, when he wanted to go to his friend's party. I shook my head. Oh no, Mister Anderson, I can't share a car with you. We're not married. People would think I'm a prostitute. What? That's insane. In the 1950s, unmarried couples needed chaperones. I will have to take the bus and meet you there. The bus? Just get in the car. That would make me a loose woman, Mister Anderson. He had to explain to everyone at the party why we arrived separately. At the party, his friend Kyle asked about my promotion. I turned to Craig. May I answer him, Mr. Anderson? Craig's face went red. Just talk to him. As you wish. I turned to Kyle. Mr. Anderson doesn't believe women should work. I will be quitting my job soon to focus on cooking and cleaning like a real woman. My mother failed to teach me that my only value is serving a man. Kyle nearly choked on his beer. Dude, what the hell? She's being stupid. Craig muttered. No. Mr. Anderson believes modern women are broken. We think we deserve Equality when we should be grateful men even put up with us. I sat quietly, hands folded, only speaking when Craig gave permission. His friends kept staring at him. The real entertainment started at his company picnic when his boss's Wife asked about my job. I smiled sweetly. Mr. Anderson says careers make women forget how to be women. Would you like my potato salad recipe instead? It's the only thing I'm good for. I spent the entire event walking three steps behind Craig, staring at the ground, calling him Mr. Anderson, and asking his permission for everything. May I have a hot dog, Mr. Anderson? Just take the damn hot dog. Is that a yes? I need you to say yes or no. His co workers started whispering. When someone asked why I kept calling him Mr. Anderson, I explained happily. Craig says modern women destroyed society by thinking they're equal to men. He wanted a traditional 1950s relationship where I knew my place. His boss overheard Craig, did you really say that? She's twisting my words. Craig growled, oh, no. Mr. Anderson was very clear. He said women should shut up, stay home, and give men sex on demand. The boss's face went ice cold.

I checked my daughter Kate's bank account and saw zeros where $300 should have been. Kate was 16 and worked 20 hours a week at a burger place, but somehow her entire paycheck had vanished. When Kate got home from her shift, I confronted her with the statement, I've been buying stuff for Zoe at school. She has a baby and nobody helps her, she explained. My first thought was that someone was running a sob story scam on my naive daughter. But Kate and sisted that Zoe desperately needed help and the baby would suffer without it. The next morning, I gave Kate extra cash and told her to give it to Zoe. Thanks, Mom. Zoe's going to cry when I give her this. That afternoon, I got a call from the school. We need to discuss something serious with you about Kate. Immediately. I rushed to the school, expecting the worst. Your daughter was seen in the parking lot giving another student prescription bottles in cash and what appeared to be a substance deal. We have zero tolerance for substances on school property, and we've already contacted the school resource officer. He turned his computer screen toward me to show the security footage of Kate handing Zoe two orange prescription bottles and money by her car. I felt sick realizing I've been giving Kate money that might have been funding prescription substance stealing. Mister Hayes, Said Kate claimed the prescriptions were antibiotics and diaper cream for a baby, but that sounded like a ridiculous lie to cover up selling pills. No teenager carries around multiple prescriptions for a baby they don't have, he said while shaking his head. That's when the school nurse walked in carrying a baby. He was coughing so hard his tiny body shook with each breath. This is Zoe's son, she said quietly while patting his back. She brought him to my office this morning because he ran out of his breathing medicine and she didn't know what else to do. The principal went completely silent. The nurse explained that Zoe was 16 and had been trying to finish school while raising a six month old baby alone. Her parents had kicked her out and she'd been living in her car for the past month. Prescriptions Kate gave her were antibiotics for the baby's lung infection and prescription diaper cream for an infected diaper rash that had gotten so bad it was bleeding. Kate had been using her own money to buy them because Zoe couldn't afford the copays. I was proud of my daughter, but also heartbroken. No teenage girl should be living in a car with a sick baby. I told Mr. Hayes I wanted to keep helping Zoe and asked where I could find her. He said she usually stayed in the parking lot after school until security made her leave. After school we found Zoe in the Parking lot, trying to change change her baby's diaper in the backseat of her car. She saw us coming and immediately started to panic like she was going to drive away. But Kate ran over before she could start the car. It's okay. This is my mom. She wants to help. Please don't call anyone. They'll take him away and he's all I have left. Zoe begged through the cracked window. The baby was wheezing so loud I could hear it from outside the car, and his little face looked gray. I convinced her to let me sit in the passenger seat so we could talk. She explain that they had been living in this car for over a month, and she washed the baby in gas station sinks at night when nobody was around. I asked about the baby's father and watched her whole body start shaking. His name is Nathan Brennan. His dad teaches chemistry here at school, she said so quietly I could barely hear her. I was 15 when Nathan invited me to his college party. He was 21 and kept giving me drinks and till I couldn't stand up straight. Then he rocked me. A few weeks later, when I told Nathan I was pregnant, he laughed in my face and said nobody would ever believe trash like me over him since he's premed at the university. She started sobbing and told us that his dad had cornered her after class one day. He grabbed My arm so hard it left bruise

My mom always bragged about being practically psychic when it came to her kids. She'd call right when we needed her, somehow knew when we were lying. Claimed she had this special mom intuition that other parents just didn't possess. Growing up, it was equal parts annoying and impressive. She'd catch me sneaking out before I even made it to the front door. She pack extra lunch money on random days that turned out to be exactly when I'd forget mine. She always seemed to know precisely what we needed when we needed it, like she could read our minds. It's a mother's gift, she say with this knowing smile. You'll understand when you have kids someday. But when I turned 18 and moved out for college, something started feeling really wrong about her supposedly supernatural abilities. She'd text me literally seconds after I got bad news, like the moment I hung up from a devastating phone call. She'd show up at my apartment with soup when I was getting sick before I told anyone I wasn't feeling well. She'd call my friends asking weirdly specific questions about my schedule, my relationships, where I've been spending my time. At first, I thought maybe she really did have some kind of sixth sense. Maybe being a mother for 18 years had fine tuned her instincts to an almost supernatural level. But Then the coincidences became too frequent, too precise, too impossible to explain away with maternal intuition alone. She knew about my breakup before I posted about it on social media. She knew I changed jobs before I told anyone in the family. She even knew about the minor fender Bender I had in a grocery store parking lot that I'd specifically decided not to mention to avoid worrying her unnecessarily. So this year for Mother's Day, I decided to test her psychic abilities in a very special way. I spent weeks meticulously preparing the perfect gift for her special day. I bought her a gorgeous antique jewelry box from her favorite vintage store downtown, the exact kind she'd been admiring and hinting about for months. But instead of filling it with the jewelry she was expecting, I put something much more meaningful and revealing inside. 23 devices total. Every single air tag I'd found sewn into my backpack, jacket linings and even my shoes. Three hidden cameras that had been disguised as phone chargers in my apartment, GPS trackers that were magnetically attached to my car in places I never would have thought to look. But that wasn't all. I also included detailed printouts of my phone records showing she'd somehow managed to clone my SIM card six months ago. Screenshots of the spy app she secretly installed on my laptop during Thanksgiving break, photos I taken of her car parked across the street from my workplace, my gym and Even outside my friend's houses, the documentation was thorough, organized and absolutely damming. Happy Mother's Day, mom. Open it up. I know you're going to absolutely love what's inside. I watched her face go through every possible human emotion as she opened that jewelry box. First, confusion as she saw the strange collection of electronics and recognition as she realized what she was looking at. shock as the full scope of her surveillance operation became clear. Finally, this weird guilty smile crept across her face like she'd been caught red handed but was still proud of her cleverness. Honey, listen, I can explain all of this. No need to explain. I interrupted, smiling sweetly. Your psychic powers are absolutely incredible, mom. You even somehow knew that I'd eventually figure out your little operation. She tried to laugh it off, nervously making some joke about being an overprotective, but I wasn't finished with my Mother's Day surprise yet. Oh, and there's one more thing, mom. Yesterday while you were at your book club meeting, I took the liberty of switching all those tracking devices over to Dad's stuff instead. You know, his car, his golf bag, his work laptop. Her face went completely white. your amazing psychic abilities might be very interested to know that according to your own it, a GPS tracking system, Dad's current location has been showing up at Jennifer Morrison's house every single Tuesday and Thursday afternoon for the past three months. Isn't that absolutely Fascinating information. The silence in the room was deafening. Her psychic powers definitely didn't see that plot twist coming.

I came home from my 12 hour nursing shift to find a BMW parked in my driveway, not blocking it, but fully in it, like the driver lived there. I parked on the street, exhausted and confused, and knocked on my neighbor's door to ask if they knew whose car it was. Nobody recognized it. The car was locked, no note, just sitting there like it belonged. I left a polite note on the windshield, hi, you're parked in my driveway. Please move your car. Thanks, and went to bed. The next morning, the car was still there, but my note was crumpled on my lawn. A new note was under my windshield wiper. Parking on the street is free. Deal with it. I was genuinely baffled. They were in my driveway but telling me to deal with it. I called the police, who said it was a civil matter since it was private property. They could only tow if it was blocking me in. I called towing companies, but they needed specific authorization forms that would take days to process. That evening, the owner finally appeared, a girl around 22, designer everything, walking from the direction of the college apartments two blocks away. She unlocked the BMW while I was watering my plants. Excuse me, this is my driveway, I said calmly. She looked at me. Like I was dirt. So? So you can't park here. The streets full. This spot was empty. It's not my problem you don't use your driveway efficiently. I don't use it efficiently because I was at work as a nurse, saving lives. She shrugged. Still not my problem. Maybe you should work different hours. She got got in her car and drove away. The audacity was breathtaking. But she'd made a critical error. She'd admitted this was her regular parking solution and she'd be back. I made some calls. The next morning, her BMW was back in my driveway. This time, I was ready. My friend Tony ran a moving company and owed me several favors from when I taken care of his mother in the ICU. He brought over four of those massive shipping containers. And position them perfectly around the BMW. Not touching it. That would be illegal. Just creating a perfect box around it with about 2 inches of clearance on each side. The containers were on my property. Completely legal. The BMW was now trapped in a metal fortress. I left a note. You said it wasn't your problem. Now it's your only problem. That evening, she was back, raining at my door. What did you do? I officially use my driveway space for storage. Not your problem. Right. Move them now. No, you can wait until I need the containers moved. Should be about 4 days. She called the police. They came, looked at the Situation and shrugged. Containers were on my property. The car was illegally parked. If anything, she was trespassing. They suggested she'd be grateful I hadn't had her towed. She tried everything. Her father, a lawyer, called, threatening to sue. I recorded the call where he admitted his daughter had parked illegally on my property. Her mother came by, offering to pay Amy. I declined. The girl herself tried breaking into the containers with various tools. My security cameras caught everything. Day two, she set up a tent next to her car. Day three, she started a social media campaign about the crazy neighbor holding her car hostage. It backfired when people pointed out she parked in someone else's driveway. Day four, she finally broke. Please. She. I begged, actually crying. I have a job interview. I need my car. I'm sorry I parked here. You're sorry you got caught, not sorry you did it? No, I'm actually sorry I've been parking in people's driveways all semester because I'm too

All the real technical documentation lived in my notebooks. The stuff that mattered. Sensor calibration tolerances, environmental testing parameters, custom modification requests. I'd handwritten everything during countless client calls and site visits. At 10 15, Beth calls directly. Randy, they're asking for you specifically. The CTO wants to discuss the pressure sensor modifications you designed for their Portland facility. Wish I could help. I say genuinely, meaning it. I liked the hollowgate team. By 10:45, Marcus, our CEO, is calling me personally. Randy, there's been a misunderstanding. Can you come in? No misunderstanding. I was terminated yesterday, effective immediately. Look, maybe Jessica was hasty. We can work this out. Sorry, Marcus, but I can't legally represent the company anymore. I'm not an employee. As a consultant, then name your rate. I'm not available. Which was true. I had a phone interview with Drift Shade limited at two PM. Hollowgate's biggest competitor.

When she couldn't deliver, they politely excused themselves and said they'd reassess their partnership options. At noon. Jessica calls me directly. Voice shaking Randy, you have to help me. This is sabotage. This is consequences. Jessica, I can report you for withholding company information. What information? I took my personal belongings when you terminated me. All official files remain on your servers. Those notebooks contain proprietary data. Those notebooks contain my personal work notes purchased with my own money. Check my employment contract.

All the real technical documentation lived in my notebooks. The stuff that mattered, sensor calibration tolerances, environmental testing parameters, custom modification requests. I'd handwritten everything during countless client calls and site visits. At 10:15, Beth calls directly, Randy, they're asking for you specifically. The CTO wants to discuss the pressure sensor modifications you designed for their Portland facility. Wish I could help. I say genuinely meaning it. I liked the Hollowgate team. By 10:45, Marcus, our CEO, is calling me personally. Randy, there's been a misunderstanding. Can you come in? No misunderstanding. I was terminated yesterday effective immediately. Look, maybe Jessica was hasty. We can work this out. Sorry, Marcus, but I can't legally represent the company anymore. I'm not an employee. As a consultant, then name your rate. I'm not available. Which was true. I had a phone interview with Drift Shade limited at two PM, Hollowate's biggest competitor. According to Beth's increasingly frantic texts, the hollowate team gave Jessica exactly 23 minutes to use the technical documentation they'd specifically Flown into review. When she couldn't deliver, they politely excuse themselves and said they'd reassess their partnership options. At noon, Jessica calls me directly, voice shaking. Randy, you have to help me. This is sabotage. This is consequences. Jessica, I can report you for withholding company information. What information? I took my personal belongings when you terminated me. All official files remain.

In the video, my husband and my son were with her. And my son was hugging her, saying he wished she could be his mother. I stared at my phone in complete shock, watching my eight year old. I'll tell another woman he wanted her as his mom. My birthday cake sat untouched on the kitchen counter. Thirty two candles melted into colorful puddles of wax. The balloons I'd hung that morning mocked me from the ceiling. Instead of crying like the old me would have done, I did something that would change everything forever. I called my lawyer first. Jennifer, it's Paisley. I need those divorce papers we just last month tonight. I don't care what time it is, Paisley. It's almost ten PM. What the hell happened? He's been secretly taking Ethan to see his ex girlfriend Marisa behind my back for months. I have video proof of everything. Jesus. I'll have the papers ready by morning. Then I called my bank's emergency hotline. Account freeze, credit cards canceled immediately. The joint savings we'd carefully built over 10 years of marriage locked down tighter than Fort Knox. By the time Marcus finally walked through our front door at midnight, smelling like her perfume, I had already filed for emergency custody, called a locksmith to change every lock in the house, and methodically Packed all his belongings into garbage bags lined up by the front door like a funeral procession. Hey, babe, sorry we're so ridiculously late tonight, he said casually, fumbling with his house key that no longer worked. Little Ethan fell asleep in the car again. He finally looked up from his phone and saw the divorce papers spread across our coffee table like evidence at a crime scene. How was your wonderful day with Marissa? I asked, my voice steady and cold as winter ice. His face went completely white. The color drained so fast I genuinely thought he might collapse and faint right there. Paisley, sweetheart, I can explain everything. It's really not what you think it is. Save your explanations for the judge tomorrow morning. You're officially served. I handed him the thick custody papers with trembling hands. His fingers shook violently as he read the emergency restraining order. Our son Ethan appeared in the doorway, rubbing his sleepy eyes, still wearing the expensive new jacket I'd never seen before in my life. Mom, what's happening? Why are all of Dad's clothes sitting outside in bags? Your father forgot it was my birthday today, honey. But he certainly remembered to take you to see his ex girlfriend instead. Ethan's little face crumpled with confusion. She said she was just Dad's old friend from college. She bought me ice cream and told me. What exactly did she tell you, baby? That maybe someday we could all live together. They're Like one big, happy family. Marcus grabbed my arm desperately, his grip almost painful. You can't just destroy and tear our entire family apart over this one thing. I already did. Now the courts will decide who Ethan really belongs with.

I couldn't believe that she was also heading to Stanford for pre med. She also couldn't stop laughing at my story about getting dumped at the door, which made me like her more, to be honest. We talked until sunrise about everything except Cassidy. Meanwhile, Braden had returned. From wherever he was. And Cassidy left crying when she saw lipstick on his collar. Her best friend told me later that she'd been posting and deleting messages all night, trying to make it look like she was having fun.

I showed her what good enough really means. Catherine's mother thinks I'm too poor to marry her daughter. Last week she cornered me in their kitchen while Catherine was in the bathroom. She press $300 into my hand for gas money. I know bartending doesn't pay much. She thinks I work at a dive bar. Catherine's tried explaining I planned corporate events, but her mother won't listen. Same thing, serving drinks to people. That night, I looked up her charity gala. I had eight months to prove her wrong. I started volunteering at her charity, but at a different location across town. She'd never check on volunteers. At Catherine's birthday dinner, her mother brought up the charity gala again. It's $5,000 a plate. We understand if you can't afford it. Catherine started to explain. I'd already bought tickets. How sweet, her mother interrupted. But real donors give more than just attendance. I smiled and stayed quiet. Catherine squeezed my hand under the table. Exhausted from defending me. Her mother leaned over to her sister. Some people belong at galas. Others serve at them. They both laughed. Catherine's eyes filled with tears. That's when I decided to show them who really didn't belong. The insults got worse every week. At her sister's engagement party, she introduced me as Catherine's friend who bartends. When Catherine corrected her, she laughed. Right. You serve appetizers, too. Then her father jumped in. During their Anniversary dinner, he pulled me aside. I know someone hiring bar managers. 40,000 a year. Real stability. He showed me a job listing on his phone. Catherine overheard and got angry. She doesn't need your help. Her mother shot back. Stop defending her. Love doesn't pay bills. What they didn't know was that I actually managed events for Fortune 500 companies. I made six figures. But I never told them because they never really asked. The charity location I volunteered at needed help with donor management. Within weeks, I was running their fundraising. The director loved my work. She had no idea I was engaged to Catherine. Then I almost got caught. Catherine saw an email on my phone from the charity thanking me for raising so much money. Why are they emailing you? My heart stopped. I told her my company was sponsoring some tables. She believed it. Her mother got meaner. At Thanksgiving, she made me sit at the kids table. You'll be more comfortable there. When I tried to sit with Catherine, she announced, we're discussing family finances. Family only. Catherine stood to leave with me. Her mother grabbed her arm. Think about your future. I almost gave up that night. Sat in my car crying. Maybe Catherine would be happier without me. Then my phone buzzed. Three of my corporate clients wanted to donate to the charity. $200,000 total because of my connections. Christmas was the worst. Her mother invited Catherine's ex boyfriend. Remember Gregory? He Just made partner at his law firm. She actually made me serve drinks to the guests. Since you're so good at it. Gregory spent the night talking about his vacation home while her mother smiled at him. I kept volunteering. I kept raising money. In eight months, I brought in half a million dollars. I also donated 50,000 of my own money. I listed it under my full legal name, Victoria. Catherine's mother only knew me as Tori. The week before the gala, I overheard her mother on the phone. Once she sees Tori at the gala surrounded by successful people, Catherine will understand the difference. Charity director pulled me aside. The board knows who you are. Your future mother in law is in for a surprise. She winked. At the pre gala reception, Catherine's mother grabbed my arm. Stay close to us. These people don't like party crashers. Her friends smirked. Trust me, I whispered to Catherine. Her mother announced loudly, don't worry, I'll introduce them to everyone. They won't know anybody here. The charity director took the stage. Tonight we honor someone special. In eight months, she

There's this guy in my neighborhood who started stealing my packages about two months ago. At first I thought it was just bad luck when my new headphones went missing. Then my coffee maker disappeared, then a birthday gift for my mom. After the fourth theft, I started tracking delivery times, obsessively trying to grab packages the second they arrived. But this guy was watching, too. I'd check the delivery notification rush outside, five minutes later, and the package would already be gone. I saw him once. He was in his mid 30s, baseball cap, driving a beat up Toyota Corolla that he'd park one street over before walking to my house. He wasn't even subtle about it. He'd stroll up my driveway in broad daylight like he owned the place. I put up a no trespassing sign. He took that, too. I added a mile you're on camera sign even though I didn't have cameras yet. The next day, that sign was in my recycling bin. That's when things got personal. He started leaving sticky notes on my door after stealing packages. The first one said, thanks for the Bluetooth speaker, sucker, with a smiley face drawn on it. The next time, after taking my workout supplements, he left a note saying, maybe try working out your brain instead. He was taunting me when he stole my girlfriend's anniversary gift. He actually had the nerve to leave a note saying she's too good for someone who can't even protect a package. Nice choice on the earrings though. That one made my blood boil. I tried everything having packages delivered to my work, but my boss shut that down. Amazon lockers were always full. I asked neighbors to grab them, but they work during the day too. The worst part was when he stole my diabetic cat special food delivery and left a note thanks for the feast, dummy. My cat had to go without his prescription food for 3 days while I waited for a replacement. I was literally trapped. I couldn't order anything to my own home. This guy was controlling my life and he was enjoying every second of it. I finally hit my limit when he stole my grandmother's medication that I'd ordered for her. The note said Hope Granny's not in a rush. Lol that was it. I went to the police station with all the sticky notes as evidence. The officer took my report, said they'd investigate, and told me package theft was unfortunately common. They'd increase patrol, they said. They'd keep an eye out, they said. But we both knew nothing would happen. It was just petty theft to them, a property crime that wasn't worth their resources. I went home furious and started researching my options online. My first thought was a glitter bomb or dye pack, but then I found forums discussing Package protect. Turns out booby trapping packages is illegal. You can actually get sued or arrested for injuring a thief. Even a harmless glitter bomb could technically be considered assault. I was about to give up when I stumbled across a post from a lawyer explaining that tampering with federal mail is a serious federal crime, not just petty theft. Federal mail includes anything sent through USPS with proper postage. The penalties were severe, up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines. That's when my plan started forming. I invested in a high quality security camera system with clear night vision and motion detection, spending nearly $500 I couldn't really afford. I made sure one camera had a perfect angle of my driveway where cars would pass. Then I prepared my trap. I ordered a cheap item from eBay, but specifically requested USPS Priority Mail shipping. When it arrived, I carefully opened it from the bottom, keeping the federal mail label intact and visible. I

Macy was 13 when she started sacrificing her own life to save her little sisters. Zada had a plastic anemia, meaning she needed extra blood, bone marrow, even organs. By 16, Macy had donated over 500 pints of blood, had corkscrews drilled into her for bone marrow six times, even gave Zeta a kidney and six 2% of her liver. At 18, she was down to 87 pounds, taking 23 pills a day to keep her remaining organs functioning. Her dream of motherhood was dead. Her immune system was destroyed, and her bones fractured upon the slightest impact. But Zada was alive, thriving, and living the teenage life may see gave up. Two years later, Macy got diagnosed with lymphoma. Doctors said it was likely the extreme stress she put her body through. And yet Macy didn't cry or didn't complain. All she asked for there was one thing. When cancer patients finish their last treatment, they ring this brass bell in the main lobby. Three rings to say you survived. Macy had watched dozens of people ring it. Their families would cry and cheer. She wanted that for once. She wanted to be the one being celebrated for surviving. She texted the family group chat, June 15th, they let me ring the remission bell. Would mean the world if you could be there. Zada instantly responded with heart emojis. The whole family promised they'd be there the morning of June 15th. Macy did her makeup for the first time in two years and even styled what was left of her hair. During her final treatment, nurses kept asking how she was feeling. Amazing. My family is coming, she kept saying. They're all coming to see me ring the bell. At 2:45, Macy was sitting in the lobby watching the main entrance, her hands shaking from excitement. But at three PM, there was nobody there. The bell coordinator asked if she was ready. Just one more minute, Macy said. They're probably just parking. At 3:05, Macy texted the group, hey, I'm at the bell waiting for you. Zada read it but gave no response. Macy called her and got nothing. She called mom and got the same, but her dad answered, hey, sweetie, what's up? Zada was laughing in the background. Dad, I'm at the hospital. The bell ceremony. There was a pause. Oh, crap, honey, that's today. We threw Zada a college acceptance party. She got into Berkeley, full ride. Macy's legs gave out. She sat down hard on the lobby bench. Zada's party. Her voice was tiny. Yeah, it was a surprise thing. She wanted to celebrate getting into pre med. You know, following in your footsteps. Helping people like you helped her. Then Zeta shouted into the phone, is that Macy? Tell her we'll celebrate with her later. Dad, Macy whispered, I'm at my last cancer treatment. The bell ceremony. I texted everyone. You all said you'd come. Oh, Honey, you know how bad I am with texts. Look, ring the bell and have someone video it. We'll watch it later. He hung up. The lobby was now full of other patients and families, all watching this girl in a yellow dress sitting alone. Macy stood up slowly and walked to the bell. She was supposed to ring it three times, but she rang it once. A few people clapped awkwardly, and that's when the tears started coming. Pamela, the head nurse, who'd been with Macy every step of the way, ran over and pulled her into a hug. I gave her everything. I gave her my body. Macy cried. I can't have kids because of it. I gave her everything, and she couldn't give me 10 minutes. The next Sunday was their regular family dinner. Macy almost didn't go, but habit is hard to break. She walked in, and everyone was still talking about Zada's Berkeley acceptance. Nobody mentioned the bell. Nobody asked about her final treatment. Nobody even said congratulations. Halfway through dinner, mom casually said, oh, Macy, did you do your little belt

My brother Jake has this girlfriend named Becca who literally cannot stand not being the center of attention for 5 minutes. Every family dinner, every holiday, every gathering, she finds a way to make it about her. Last Thanksgiving, she announced she was pregnant right when my dad was about to carve the Turkey. Turns out she wasn't even pregnant. Just wanted to see everyone's reactions. So when I was planning my wedding to my fiance, Ryan, I knew I had to do something about the Becca situation. This was going to be my one day, the one day that was supposed to be about me and Ryan starting our life together. I called Jake about three months before the wedding. Hey, so about the wedding, I started. I need to ask you something kind of awkward. What's up, he said. And I could hear him eating cereal in the background. I really don't want Becca there. I know that sounds harsh, but she always makes everything about herself and I just can't deal with that stress on my wedding day. The line went quiet for like 10 seconds and Jake exploded. Are you serious right now you're uninviting my girlfriend from your wedding? I'm not uninviting her because she was never invited in the first place. The invitation was just for you. That's the same thing. We've been together for two years. She's basically family. I tried To explain that it wasn't personal, that I just wanted one drama free day. But Jake wasn't having it. He said if Becca couldn't come, then he wouldn't come either. I told him that was his choice. Hope think he changed his mind? He didn't. But here's where it gets crazy. The day of my wedding, I'm getting my makeup done in the bridal suite when my cousin Madison bursts in. Uh, you need to see this, he says, shoving her phone in my face. It's Becca's Instagram story. She's posted like 15 videos of herself getting all dressed up, doing her makeup, picking out jewelry. The caption on the last one says, can't wait to celebrate love today with a bunch of heart emojis and the location tagged as our wedding venue. My heart drops. He's coming anyway. Madison nods. Jake's outside right now arguing with your dad about it. He says he changed his mind and decided to bring her. I'm standing there in my wedding dress, half my makeup done and I have to deal with this. So I march outside in my robe and slippers, my hair still in curlers. Jake sees me coming and his face goes red. Before you say anything. No, I cut him off. Absolutely not. I told you three months ago she couldn't come. You said you wouldn't come. Now you're both here. Becca steps out from behind Jake wearing this bright red dress that looks exactly like something a bride. Would wear to her own reception. I'm not even kidding. It had sparkles and everything. I just wanted to support you on your special day, she says in this fake sweet voice. I brought you a gift and everything. Get out. I said, both of you right now. Jake starts yelling about how I'm being a bridezilla and how Becca just wants to be supportive. Meanwhile, Becca is taking selfies in front of the wedding decorations. That's when my dad steps in. He grabs Jake by the arm and says, you made your choice three months ago. You can make it again right now. Either she leaves and you stay or you both leave. Jake looks at me, then at Becca, then back at me. I'm literally holding my breath. He chooses Becca. They both storm off, but not before Becca posts another Instagram story about how some people are just too selfish to share their happiness while filming our wedding venue in the background. The wedding went perfectly after that. No drama, no attention seeking, no weird announcements during the toasts. Ryan and I had our first dance without worrying about someone trying to cut in or make a scene. But the real kicker, two weeks after our wedding, Jake calls me crying. Turns out Becca had been cheating on him with his roommate for like six months. She only wanted to come to the wedding because she knew his whole family would be there and she could play The perfect girlfriend. One last time before she dumped him.

So I'm 24, and I've been vegan for, like, 10 years now. Ever since I was a little kid and found out where meat comes from. I just couldn't do it anymore. Everyone in my life knows this. My family, friends, co workers, literally everyone. Four nights ago, I was at this party at my friend Jake's place. I'll be honest. I got absolutely wasted. Like, embarrassingly drunk. My friends were all laughing and having a good time, and I was just trying to keep up with everyone else. Around midnight, I got super hungry. You know how it is when you're drunk. My friend Caitlin comes up to me with this made of chicken nuggets, and I'm like, oh, these look good. Are they vegan? She goes, yeah, totally. They're those Sunfed ones from the store. I knew Sunfed made pretty good fake chicken stuff, so I trusted her. I grabbed, like, six nuggets and started eating them. It tasted kind of weird, but I figured it was just because I was drunk and my taste buds were off. Plus, the lighting was dim, and I couldn't really see them that well. I finished the whole plate and didn't think anything of it. The next morning, I woke up with the worst hangover ever. My head was pounding and I felt sick to my stomach. But then around noon, my sister Emma text me saying, you need to check Jake's Snapchat. Story right now. I had this sinking feeling in my gut. I opened Snapchat and there it was. The first video showed Caitlin holding up a package of actual chicken nuggets. Like, real Tyson chicken nuggets from the freezer section. Then the next video was me asking if they were vegan and her saying yes. Then there's this clip of me eating them and being all happy and drunk. But the worst part was the last few videos after I left the party, they filmed themselves pretending to be when I would find out. Caitlin was fake crying and screaming, oh no, the poor chickens! In this mocking voice. Jake was pretending to throw up and going, I can't believe I ate a real animal! They were all laughing hysterically. I screen recorded everything before they could delete it. I was shaking, I was so angry. This wasn't just some harmless joke. They knew how important being vegan was to me. They knew I hadn't eaten meat in over 10 years, and they filmed themselves mocking something that was genuinely important to me. I called my sister first and she was furious. She told me I should definitely do something about it. Then I called my mom and she said the same thing. They both said this went way beyond a normal prank. I spent like two hours researching online and found out that deliberately giving someone food they can't or won't eat can actually be considered food tampering. Especially When it's done without their knowledge and filmed for humiliation purposes. So I drove to the police station with all the video evidence. The officer I talked to was actually really understanding. He said they'd seen cases like this before, especially with people who have food allergies or dietary restrictions for religious reasons. He took my statement and all the evidence within three days. Caitlin, Jake, and another friend named Austin, who was also involved, got served with charges. Food tampering is apparently a misdemeanor, but it can still go on your record and everything. My lawyer friend told me I actually have a pretty strong case. Food tampering is taken seriously, especially when there's video evidence. And it was done specifically to cause distress. Plus the public humiliation aspect makes it even worse. The court date is next month, and honestly, I'm not sure what's going to happen.

There's this guy in my neighborhood who started stealing my packages about two months ago. At first I thought it was just bad luck when my new headphones went missing. Then my coffee maker disappeared, then a birthday gift for my mom. After the fourth theft, I started tracking delivery times, obsessively trying grab packages the second they arrived. But this guy was watching, too. I checked the delivery notification rush outside five minutes later, and the package would already be gone. I saw him once. He was in his mid 30s, baseball cap, driving a beat up Toyota Corolla that he'd park one street over before walking to my house. He wasn't even subtle about it. He'd stroll up my driveway in broad daylight like he owned the place. I put up a no trespassing sign. He took that, too. I added a while you're on camera sign even though I didn't have cameras yet. The next day, that sign was in my recycling bin. That's when things got personal. He started leaving sticky notes on my door after stealing packages.

So I gave him the 1950s housewife he wanted. I had been with Craig for three years when he completely ruined my promotion dinner at this fancy Italian place downtown. Women today are the problem with everything, he said, twirling his pasta. They don't know how to be real women anymore. They're always trying to wear the pants, competing with men instead of serving them. My grandpa had it right. His woman stayed home, cooked his meals, and didn't talk back. My wine glass stopped halfway to my mouth. Craig, we are literally here to celebrate my promotion. That's exactly what I mean. You care more about your stupid job than making me happy. Back in the day, women knew their place and kept their man satisfied. I looked around the restaurant where we were supposed to be celebrating my success. So you want a traditional relationship, like the actual 1950s? His eyes lit up. Finally you get it. Yes. A real woman who acts like a woman should, the way god intended. Okay, traditional it is. He reached over to grab my hand. See, I knew you would understand. Most women would get all feminist and defensive about this. The next morning, I showed up to breakfast in a full 1950s housewife outfit, complete with pearls and a puffy dress that covered my ankles. Good morning, Mr. Anderson, I said, putting his coffee down. He laughed. Okay, the outfit is cute. But you don't have to call me that. Oh, but I do. In the 1950s, a proper lady always addresses her man respectfully. His smile started to fade that evening when he wanted to go to his friend's party. I shook my head. Oh, no, Mr. Anderson. I can't share a car with you. We're not married. People would think I'm a prostitute. What? That's insane. In the 1950s, unmarried couples needed chaperones. I will have to take the bus and meet you there. The bus? Just get in the car. That would make me a loose woman, Mister Anderson. He had to explain to everyone at the party why we arrived separately. At the party, his friend Kyle asked about my promotion. I turned to Craig. May I answer him, Mister Anderson? Craig's face went red. Just talk to him. As you wish. I turned to Kyle. Mr. Anderson doesn't believe women should work. I will be quitting my job soon to focus on cooking and cleaning like a real woman. My mother failed to teach me that my only value is serving a man. Kyle nearly choked on his beer. Dude, what the hell? She's being stupid. Craig muttered. No, Mr. Anderson believes modern women are broken. I think we deserve Equality when we should be grateful men even put up with us. I sat quietly, hands folded, only speaking when Craig gave permission. His friends kept staring at him. The real entertainment started at his company picnic. When his boss's wife asked about my job, I smiled sweetly. Mr. Anderson says careers make women forget how to be women. Would you like my potato salad recipe instead? The only thing I'm good for. I spent the entire event walking three steps behind Craig, staring at the ground, calling him Mr. Anderson, and asking his permission for everything. May I have a hot dog, Mr. Anderson? Just take the damn hot dog. Is that a yes? I need you to say yes or no. His co workers started whispering. When someone asked why I kept calling him Mr. Anderson, I explained happily. Craig says modern women destroyed society by thinking they're equal to men. He wanted a traditional 1950s relationship where I knew my place. His boss overheard Craig, did you really say that? She's twisting my words. Craig growled, oh, no. Mr. Anderson was very clear. He said women and should shut up, stay home, and give men sex on demand. The boss's face went ice cold. HR will want to discuss this on Monday, Craig. By week three, Craig was cracking. Can we please have sex? He asked one night. I gasped, clutching my pearls. Literally, Mr. Anderson, good girls don't do that before marriage. What would? Jesus

Cassidy dumped me for my best friend Braden at prom entrance. And it turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to me. What she didn't know was that I'd already spent $400 on matching burgundy outfits she begged for. Can't January. I've been working doubles at a pizza joint every weekend. Had her dad's blessing to ask her to be my prom queen. Even practice my speech in the car during lunch breaks like an idiot. But when I showed up at her house that Friday night in the burgundy tux corsage shaking in my hands, her mom's face told me everything. Honey, she already left with Braden. I sat on the porch with my head in my heads when I realized what was happening. But I drove to the venue anyway, thinking maybe her mom was confused. Nope. I found them at the entrance. Cassidy wearing the burgundy dress I'd bought, but with his cheap gold corsage on her wrist. She looked at me with zero emotion. Braden and I have been together for months. You were too busy with college applications to notice. Then my best friend, the guy who'd help me pick her corsage that morning, actually said, thanks for keeping her warm, bro. I handed my sixty dollar corsage to some terrified freshman girl standing nearby and walked into prom alone. The whole time I Kept thinking about that Stanford scholarship. I've been planning to decline to stay near her. Maybe I didn't have to anymore. As soon as I walked in, something strange happened. People started surrounding me. Not with pity, but actual anger at them. My younger sister dragged me to the dance floor. Everyone saw what they did. Everyone thinks they're trash. Then I saw Cassidy standing by the punch bowl by herself, pretending to text. Someone grabbed my hand right then. It was Brandon's ex. He's outside with someone else right now. He's been playing Cassidy since day one, just like he did with me. We danced a bit while Cassidy watched from across the room, her face getting redder with each song. Things got crazy, though. When they announced prom court and the DJ actually called my name for king. The entire gym went bonkers. Cassidy didn't even make court, despite campaigning for months with homemade cookies and promises. She tried to hug me during the crowning, but I walked past her to dance with the Queen. Things were only going to get better, though. Everyone went to a huge after party, where I met this cute girl from another high school. I couldn't believe that she was also heading to Stanford for pre med. She also couldn't stop laughing at my story about getting dumped at the door, which made me like her more, to be honest. We talked until sunrise about everything except Cassidy. Meanwhile, Braden had returned. From wherever he was. And Cassidy left crying when she saw lipstick on his collar. Her best friend told me later that she been posting and deleting messages all night, trying to make it look like she was having fun. Three weeks later, my phone wouldn't stop buzzing. At two in the morning, 27 messages from Cassidy. Went to his house, and another girl answered the door. He's been with three other people this whole time. You were the only real thing I had. The funny thing was, Cassidy thought she was upgrading when she picked Braden. Instead, she freed me to take that scholarship, meet someone who actually wanted the same future, and build a life she never would have let me have.

My sister died when my niece Chloe was 12 and her dad basically disappeared after that. So Chloe moved in with me and my husband. He was this quiet kid who barely talked for the first year, which honestly broke my heart because my sister was the loudest person alive. By the time Chloe turned 15, she started opening up more. She tell me about school, drama, boys she thought were cute, normal teenage stuff. But then junior year, she started acting different. She get weird when her friends talked about guys and she stopped mentioning crushes all together. I figured she was just focusing on school. One night she was helping me make dinner when she goes, Aunt Jamie, what would you do if someone in our family was gay? I'm stirring pasta sauce trying to act casual and I said something like, love them the exact same way I always have. She got quiet after that. A few weeks later, she brought home this girl named Alex for a study session, except they weren't studying anything. They we're sitting way too close on the couch sharing earbuds and Chloe was laughing more than I'd seen in years. When Alex left, Chloe had this dopey smile that gave everything away. I didn't say anything because I wanted her to tell me when she was ready. But then my mom called last month asking if Chloe Was dating anyone. My mom's old school Catholic, the type who still thinks being gay is a choice and that prayer can fix everything. She started going on about how she couldn't wait for Chloe to find a nice boy and settle down. That's when I realized the problem. See, my sister left Chloe a pretty big inheritance that she gets when she turns 18. But there's a catch. My mom controls it until then. And knowing my mom, if she found out Chloe was gay, she'd probably find some way to mess with that money or make Chloe's life hell. So when Chloe finally came out to me last week, I was in my kitchen at midnight, scared I'd kick her out. I hugged her tight and told her I was proud of her. But then I said, listen, you need to keep this between us for now. Your grandma can't know until you get your inheritance. She looked confused. So I explained the whole situation, how grandma still thinks gay people are going to hell, how she controls the money, how we only have to wait six more months until Chloe turns 18. Chloe got upset and said she was tired of hiding who she was. I, I told her I wasn't asking her to hide forever, just to be smart about it. Bring Alex over whenever you want, I said. Be yourselves here, but around grandma maybe. Don't mention the girlfriend part yet. She called me a Coward and locked herself in her room for two days. My husband thinks I'm wrong, too, says we shouldn't let my mom's bigotry control our choices. I've seen how nasty my mom can get when she disapproves of something. I cut off my cousin for getting pregnant at 19 and didn't speak to him for three years. Six months feels like forever when you're 17 and in love. But that inheritance could pay for Chloe's college, maybe help her buy a house someday. It's her mom's money, money my sister saved specifically for Chloe's future.

My sister died when my niece Chloe was 12 and her dad basically disappeared after that. So Chloe moved in with me and my husband. He was this quiet kid who barely talked for the first year, which honestly broke my heart because my sister was the loudest person alive. By the time Chloe turned 15, she started opening up more. She tell me about school, drama, boys she thought were cute, normal teenage stuff. But then junior year, she started acting different. She get weird when her friends talked about guys and she stopped mentioning crushes all together. I figured she was just focusing on school. One night she was helping me make dinner when she goes, Aunt Jamie, what would you do if someone in our family was gay? I'm stirring pasta sauce trying to act casual and I said something like, love them the exact same way I always have. She got quiet after that. A few weeks later, she brought home this girl named Alex for a study session, except they weren't studying anything. They we're sitting way too close on the couch sharing earbuds and Chloe was laughing more than I'd seen in years. When Alex left, Chloe had this dopey smile that gave everything away. I didn't say anything because I wanted her to tell me when she was ready. But then my mom called last month asking if Chloe Was dating anyone. My mom's old school Catholic, the type who still thinks being gay is a choice and that prayer can fix everything. She started going on about how she couldn't wait for Chloe to find a nice boy and settle down. That's when I realized the problem.

And now he's crying to me because all our major clients followed me out the door. Ricardo strutted into my annual review 30 minutes late, laughing on the phone about firing someone who'd asked for maternity leave. He hung up, looked at me like I was dirt on his shoe, and said he had 10 minutes before his massage appointment. I'd save this company from bankruptcy three times, built our entire client base from nothing. And he once introduced me at a conference as the help. But I personally convinced major corporations to trust us. I started explaining why I deserved a raise after 10 years, and he looked at me like I was the biggest moron in the room. You want 30% more for what? Answering emails and phone calls? He laughed like I told a joke. Look at this. He spun his laptop around, showing me a job posting, my exact position, offering half my salary. I could hire two college kids to do your job. How? I could train my assistant to do what you do in a week. Ricardo, those three big accounts only work with us because. Because we're cheap and convenient, not because you're some irreplaceable genius. He stood up, walking to his window that overlooked the parking lot. You know what your problem is? You think you matter. You think these clients care about you. They don't. They care about rates and delivery times. You're just the voice on the phone. Replaceable. That word hung in the air like a slap. The phone rang, interrupting the moments. Ricardo's assistant knocked and entered, looking nervous. Sorry, but Mister Tanaka from our biggest client is online. One? He's asking for her specifically. She nodded toward me. Ricardo's face went red. Transfer him to me. I'm the CEO here. I tried. He said he only deals with her. Ricardo grabbed the phone, punching buttons. Aggressive. Mister Tanaka? This is Ricardo, the CEO. What can I do for you? His face changed as he listened. Without a word, he handed me the phone. Turns out they had a shipping crisis, which I fixed in five minutes. Something Ricardo couldn't have understood if I'd explained it for hours. When I hung up, he was furious. See? Simple problem. Anyone who knows our system could have fixed that. You're not special. You're not irreplaceable. You're convenient. That's it. So no raise, then? No raise. In fact, you should be grateful I don't cut your pay to match what I could hire someone else for. You want my advice? Shut up and do your job. Or test how replaceable you really are. I spent the weekend making phone calls. First to Mister Tanaka, then to our second biggest client, then our third. Three conversations, three confirmations. They didn't do business with the company. They did business with me. By Sunday night, I had three job offers from competitors and more importantly, three clients. Ready? Follow me. Monday morning, I walked into Ricardo's office and handed him my resignation, effective immediately. He actually smiled as he read it. Running to a competitor. Good luck starting from zero. You'll be begging for this job in a month. He was already pulling up recruiting websites. I'll have someone in your chair by Friday, probably.

My mother in law, Gloria, spent last Christmas going through every single gift bag at my house like a crazy person. She was getting more and more frantic with each bag she checked. Gloria had been giving me the worst gifts for years. Last year on my birthday, she handed me this old candle that said happy 50th on it. When I was only 32, the price tag from some garage sale was still stuck on it, showing 75 cents. And for Christmas, she gave me a cookbook called cooking for one. Even though I've been married to her son for five years. Inside, someone named Janet had written good luck, Janet in pen. When I tried bringing it up, she just laughed. Often say the thought is what counts. But when her birthday rolled around, she expected the exact perfume she wanted and specific jewelry she'd been eyeing. She literally cried once because her gift came in a regular box instead of a fancy gift bag. My husband stood there watching me wrap Gloria's Christmas present in wrinkled paper from last year. Inside was the foot spa she gave me last month with a thrift store sticker still on it for $12 on Christmas morning. Gloria unwrapped it and her face went pale. This looks familiar, she said slowly. Found it at a cute little shop, I told her. Two months later, for her birthday, I gave Her. That cooking for one cookbook with a sticky note over Janet's message. She opened it in front of her whole book club and the room went silent. I knew something was off, but couldn't figure out what. Mother's Day came and she was nervous opening my gift. It was the happy 50th candle with the 75 cent tag. I'm 67, she said. It's decorative. Age is just a number for her anniversary. She actually shook the box before opening it. Inside was a singing fish from their garage that she'd given my husband three years ago. The batteries were dead. This time she stared at me for a full 10 seconds before forcing a thank you. By summer, Gloria was losing it. She'd started keeping a notebook, writing down what she gave people. At her sister's birthday party, she unwrapped the purse with a broken zipper and immediately looked at me. I just smiled. Thanksgiving came and she refused to open my gift in front of anyone. But her husband grabbed it and opened it for her. Wine glasses with dolphins. These were in our donation box, said Gloria. Grabbed his arm hard. No, they weren't, she said quickly. But now he was suspicious, too. At my birthday in November, Gloria gave me an envelope with cash. Thought this would be easier, she said, watching me carefully. I thanked her warmly. She looked relieved. Then Christmas decorations started going up and Gloria got tense again. Our family Christmas party. Was packed with relatives. Gloria kept her gift from me in her lap, not opening it. Her sister Barbara kept asking her to open it so everyone could see. Finally Gloria gave in and started unwrapping it slowly. Inside was a crystal vase with a massive crack down the side. Gloria went still. Barbara leaned over to look at it. The whole room was watching. Now wait, Barbara said, picking it up. Gloria, isn't this grandma's vase? The one you dropped at Easter Five years ago? My father in law stood up to look closer. You told

My dad said, we didn't think you'd wanna come since you barely finished school yourself. I just smiled and said, then don't worry about my ceremony next month. Two weeks later, my cousin posted a selfie standing under a banner with my face on it. That's when the call started. The banner read, Congratulations, Doctor Emma Mitchell, Suma Kumlaude. My phone exploded with notifications from family members who'd written me off years ago. See, my family always saw me as the failure. My brother Jake was the golden child. Straight A's, debate Captain, perfect everything. I had undiagnosed ADHD and struggle with C's and D's. Every dinner became an interrogation about my latest disappointment. Why can't you just apply yourself like Jake? My mom would ask, while my dad shook his head in silent judgment. Jake would sit there looking uncomfortable, but never defended me. The constant comparisons crushed my spirit until I stopped trying altogether. When I graduated high school, barely passing, they threw Jake a lavish party with extended family, friends and my parents colleagues for me. Hence dinner and a community college pamphlet. We have to be realistic about your capabilities, Emma, my dad said, sliding the brochure across the table like a consolation prize. I moved out the next day with just my Honda Civic and whatever fit in the trunk. My parents seemed almost relieved to see me go. Jake called once to ask Where I was staying, but the conversation was brief and awkward. I found a tiny studio apartment and took a job as a receptionist at a medical clinic to pay the bills. I visited for holidays, and during the pitying looks and pointed questions about when I would get serious about my future, they'd update me on Jake's achievements, his internships, his academic awards, his acceptance to prestigious MBA programs. I just nod and smile. What they didn't know was that working at the clinic had sparked something in me. I found the medical field fascinating, and several doctors noticed my natural aptitude for understanding complex aces. 1 physician, Doctor Ramirez took me under her wing. She recognized my ADHD symptoms immediately and helped me get properly diagnosed and treated. You have a brilliant mind, Emma, she told me. You just needed the right tools to access it. With her encouragement, I enrolled in night classes at the community college. For the first time in my life, I experience experienced academic success. My grades were stellar. I discovered that with proper support for my ADHD, I didn't just learn, I excelled. I transferred to a four year university, completed my undergraduate degree with honors, and was accepted to medical school. Throughout this journey, I maintained minimal contact with my family. Holiday visits became phone calls, then just text messages. They never asked about my education, assuming I was still working as a receptionist. A few times I tried mentioning my Classes. But my father would change the subject, and my mother would look uncomfortable. Jake was too busy with his own success to notice mine. Only Megan, my cousin on my mother's side, knew the truth. She always been kind to me, and when I told her about medical school, she became my biggest cheerleader. She attended every milestone. My white coat ceremony, my clinical rotations, my research present tentations. The day before Jake's NBA graduation dinner, I called my parents one last time. Are you sure there's no room for me tomorrow? I asked. Emma, we've been through this. My dad said it's for people who've actually accomplished something academically. That's when I knew I was done hiding. At my medical school graduation, Megan sat in the front row beaming

My best friend Claire was dying and needed me to make her a promise that would destroy my marriage. We were sitting in the hospice room while her three kids colored in the hallway when she grabbed my hand and asked me to adopt them after she was gone. Her boys were 11 and 9, and her daughter had just turned 7. Their dad had overdosed two years earlier, and with Claire's parents dead and her sister in Germany, there was nobody else. I wanted to say yes immediately, my husband had already told me that if I even considered taking them, we were done. Our son Caleb, was 12 and severely autistic, requiring constant supervision that consumed our entire lives. My husband worked nights so I could work days, and we tagged each other like wrestlers because Caleb couldn't be left alone for five minutes without potentially hurting himself. We hadn't been on a date in three years or had a conversation that wasn't about therapy, schedules, or medications. Adding three traumatized kids would push us past our breaking point, and he had made it clear he would leave before letting that happen. But Claire was the only person who showed up when Caleb was diagnosed while everyone else disappeared. She brought groceries when I couldn't leave the house and watched him during meltdowns so I could shower, and never acted like we were A. The social worker visited the day after Claire died, and the visit went exactly as I expected. Caleb had a meltdown when she arrived and spent 40 minutes hitting himself while I tried to calm him down. My husband stood in the corner with arms crossed while the social worker took notes and asked how we would manage three additional children when we were clearly overwhelmed. He laughed out loud at that question and walked out, slamming the door so hard the picture frames rattled. The kids were in emergency foster placement for 72 hours, then would be separated into different homes unless family stepped forward to take them. The oldest had started wetting the bed and refusing to eat, while the middle boy wouldn't speak and just sat humming and rocking. The little girl kept asking when Mommy was coming back from heaven. My husband found me crying in Caleb's room and delivered the ultimatum I had been dreading since Claire asked for my promise. If you do this, I'm filing for divorce and seeking primary custody of Caleb because you're being irresponsible with his care. The words came out flat and mechanical, the way he processed anything too heavy to feel. Part of me understood, because Caleb would suffer if we tried integrating three grieving children into our controlled routine. But the oldest had memorized every Pokemon and could talk about them for hours, which would connect with Caleb's identical obsession. The middle child moved like a Ghost and wouldn't disturb Caleb's need for predictability, while the little girl understood different meant special because Claire had taught her that these weren't random foster kids. The children who knew our house and called me Auntie, with nobody else who even knew their middle names. The foster family called that night because the little girl wouldn't stop screaming, and the oldest had tried running away twice looking for my house. The little girl's wailing came through the phone, begging for her mommy or me or anyone who smelled familiar. While the foster mother asked if I could fix this over the phone. My husband watched from the doorway as I lied that everything would work out when we both knew the system would swallow them whole. You can't save everyone, he said after I hung up. But the

Growing up, Kenzie never let me forget my place in our friendship. Every party, every hangout, every introduction came with the same unspoken rule. I was the designated ugly fat friend who made her shine brighter. This is my friend who's really funny, she'd say, which everyone knew meant not pretty. It hurt every single time. Kenzie was gorgeous, I knew that. But her constant reminders made me believe I was worthless. Was I really that hideous? When I was 22, something shifted. I needed a physical outlet for my anxiety and found a groupon for a rock climbing gym across town. The first day, my hands shook on every hold. But something about solving each route, finding my path up the wall, made me feel powerful. That's when I discovered my escape. I started climbing four nights a week in secret. My hands bled, then calloused. Ice my forearms after every session. Watch technique videos until 2:00am, practice grip strength exercises at my desk. Wednesday and Friday nights, I climbed with the regulars, including this guy, Sebastian, who became my climbing partner. We spot each other, celebrate sends, build genuine friendship through shared challenges. I never mentioned him to Kenzie. She wouldn't care about my gym friends anyway. Meanwhile, Kenzie had become obsessed with her marketing firm crush. She constantly prove I was the ugly friend by making me stand Next to her in mirrors. See the difference? She'd say, adjusting her hair. Some people just have it. Others are good listeners. She'd drag me shopping, hold up identical outfits against us both. This would look cute on me. You should stick to black. It's slimming. What killed me was how she document everything on Instagram, always cropping me out or positioning me behind her natural beauty. She option photos where I was literally holding her phone's ring light. I started wondering if she was right. Maybe I was fooling myself, thinking climbing made me worth something. Kenzie's birthday party was approaching. This rooftop bar event she'd been planning for months. She'd invited her entire office, especially her crush. He finally rsvp'd. Yes! She squealed. I need you there. don't talk too much. Just laugh at my jokes and leave early if I give you the signal. The night of the party, she made me wear this shapeless black dress. It's so you. She lied. As guests arrived, she positioned me strategically. Visible enough to make her look charitable for having an ugly friend, hidden enough not to distract. Then her crush walked in with three friends. Kenzie grab my arm, whispered, remember your wallpaper. But when he scanned the crowd, his eyes stopped on me. His whole face lit up. Oh, my god, red! He called out, using my climbing nickname. Kenzie froze. Sebastian practically ran over his friends, trailing behind. Guys, this is the girl I've Been telling you about the one who sent that impossible 5 11 route last week? He turned to me, eyes bright with genuine excitement. I can't believe you're here. Wait. You know, Kenzie, for the next hour, Sebastian couldn't stop talking about our climbing adventures. He told everyone about the time I helped him overcome his fear of overhangs, how I taught him this specific heel hook technique, how watching me climb had made him a better athlete. His friends already knew stories.

I found out why at our wedding. I'm getting ready in the bridal suite, and my bridesmaids just left for coffee. Finally alone for a minute. Here's what you need to know about the man I'm about to marry. I moved across the country for him. California to Maine. Do you know how cold Maine is? But the way he looked at me at the airport that first day, holding that stupid handmade sign that said, my California sunshine made every frozen morning worth it. I nursed his mother through chemo last year. Held the okay while she threw up at 3:00am. Cleaned it, held her hand. She grabbed my face once between treatments and whispered, you saved my son. That's when I knew we were real family. When he lost his job, he went through the darkest six months. Some days, I'd have to guide him to the shower, help him remember to eat. He'd play call of duty until 4:00am because he said it was the only thing that kept the anxiety quiet. But watching him fight through it, watching him slowly come back to life, that's real love. When he finally got better, he proposed by hiding the ring in my first edition Harry Potter, the one my grandmother left me. He was so nervous, he accidentally cut too deep and destroyed the binding. He literally cry. I'd when he realized what he'd done. Still checks every antique bookstore. We passed, determined to find a replacement. That's my future husband. He messes up, but never stops trying to fix it. Now, I knew we couldn't afford a very lavish wedding, but the main thing I wanted was for my wedding dress to have pockets. I know, silly, but I needed something to hold on to when I get nervous. Something that's just mine. Searched everywhere for months. Finally found this ivory silk dress with hidden pockets so deep I could bury my whole hands. Don't care about lace or beating or whatever. Just wanted those pockets. My mom says I'm weird, but my fiance gets it. He always gets me. The ceremony is beautiful. He actually cries when he sees me. His mother, cancer free now, mouths thank you, and I almost lose it. The photographer whispers, we're the most in love couple she's ever shot. Everyone's crying happy tears. My dad actually smiles for the first time since mom died. We wrote our own vows. He looks me in the eyes and promises to always be honest and never keep secrets, as he can't wait to start a family when the time is right. I believe him. Every single word. Reception starts, and his coworker shows up late looking green. Like, actually green. She keeps staring at me during dinner. With his face. It's like. Like she's at a funeral. I saw her try to approach me twice, but my husband intercepts. She's drunk, he says. But I'm Watching her. She's drinking water during our cake cutting. She's sobbing in the corner. Not pretty tears. Ugly crying. My hands find my pockets. That nervous thing I do when I noticed there's paper. Thick paper. I excuse myself to the bathroom, and the coworker follows me, mascara streaming down her face. I'm so sorry. I tried to tell you before. My heart's pounding. Tell me what? He's gasping between sobs. Check your pocket. I paid your Taylor to put it there. You deserve to know. Then she bolts. I can't breathe. My hands shake as I pull out the paper. It's a sonogram. Three months old. On the back and purple pen. I'm keeping it. You deserve to know.

Then her friend told me, I'd make you mine tonight. She panicked for months. My situationship cried about how much she needed me for her birthday. I spent all morning decorating her place while she was at the spa I paid for. When she walked through the door and everyone yelled, surprise! She's squealed and hugged every single person except me. Oh, my god, you guys are the best! She gushed, talking to everyone while I stood there holding the custom cake I'd ordered three weeks go. She literally walked around me like I was furniture. She ignored me while I tried to wish her a happy birthday. When her cousin asked, who's that guy by the cake? She actually said, oh, that's just Harry. He helped out a bit. Helped out? I'd literally coordinated every single person in this room and paid for everything. You must be the famous Harry. Set a voice beside me as I set the cake down, I learn to find her best friend, Ariel, who I'd heard about constantly but never met. She was visiting from Seattle for the party. Brunette with kind eyes. Famous might be a stretch, I said, watching her take selfies with everyone while I became invisible in her living room. Ariel followed my gaze. She always does this, doesn't she? Keeps people at arms length while making them think they're close. She picked up a champagne glass. I've watched her do It since college. You seem different, though. Let me guess, Ariel continued, studying me. You met on Tinder. She said she wanted something real. The first date was perfect, right? Told you she could see something special with you. I stared at her, stunned. How did you? Because that's her script, Ariel said simply. Same one she used on the last three guys. Did she cry about her ex ruining her ability to trust? Ariel's words hit something deep. Eight months of I need more time to figure out what I want. Eight months of being introduced as just my name. Eight months of watching her keep her options open while I closed mine completely. Last month, when I brought not being exclusive again, she cried. Said I was pressuring her, that she thought we were perfect how we were. I'd apologized. Apologized for wanting to be her boyfriend officially. You decorated this whole place, didn't you? Ariel said, looking at the rose gold theme. I spent hours perfecting because I knew it was her favorite. Her friends told me you coordinated everything. Even drove to three different stores to find those specific balloons. Nodded, watching her show some guy her tinder matches while laughing with her cousin. She deleted tinder, right? Ariel asked. Of course not, I said. She needs it for networking. You know what's crazy? Ariel continued. In all our calls, she's never once called you her boyfriend. But she loses it when you don't text back. Fast enough. The truth of it stung. Just last week, she'd shown up at my apartment at 2:00am, crying because I'd fallen asleep and missed her calls, convinced I was with someone else. Ariel moved closer, her voice dropping. I came here to visit her, but really, I wanted to meet you. She talks about you constantly, but only when she's worried you might leave. It's always Harry might be seeing someone else. Or Harry didn't heart my message. Across the room, I saw her notice us talking. She immediately stopped mid conversation with her cut.

So I became everyone's plus one. My wife Angela walked into the living room holding two wedding invitations while I was watching TV. I need to bring grant to these weddings, she said. Grant was her twenty year old assistant at work. Why grant? I asked, genuinely confused. My whole department will be there if I bring you. Everyone gossips about me playing favorites with him since I'm his boss, but if we go together as co workers, it looks better. She said it like she'd been practicing this speech. Plus, my annual review is next month. My boss will be at both weddings watching everything. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. You're taking grant as your date instead of your husband? It's eject for my promotion. She waved the invitations at me. You hate weddings anyway. You always complain about the small talk. That was true, but this felt wrong. Fine, I said, take Grant. Angela smiled like she'd won the lottery. I knew you'd be logical about this. First wedding came around and Angela spent two hours getting ready, trying on three different dresses before leaving with grant at noon. I was sitting on the couch feeling pretty weird about the whole thing, when my phone rang at 2. It was Ryan from my gym. Hey man, you coming to my wedding today? I nearly dropped my phone. Your wedding is today? Yeah. Didn't Angela tell you? She works with my dad. You're on the list. I looked at the invitation stuck on our fridge, and my heart started racing. She said she was bringing someone else. I told him. So what? I invited you separately. We basketball three times a week. An hour later, I walked into that wedding feeling like I was about to cause chaos. Angela's face went completely white when she spotted me at the bar, and I'm not gonna lie, it felt pretty good. She basically sprinted over with grant trailing behind, looking confused. What are you doing here? Ryan invited me from basketball. You didn't tell me Ryan was getting married. You didn't ask whose wedding it was. Her boss appeared beside us, holding a beer. Oh, good, you're both here, he said, and his face changed. Wait. Why aren't you sitting together? Angela's mouth opened and closed like a fish. Grant needed to network. Her boss looked between us, and I could see him putting pieces together. You brought him instead of your husband? The words just hung there. It's complicated, Angela stammered. Her boss walked away, shaking his head, and I knew this was already backfiring. Three weeks later was the second wedding, and Angela left with grant again like nothing had happened. This time, I didn't need a phone call, though. The bride, Julie, was my cousin's best friend, and she'd invited me months ago when she heard Angela Couldn't make it. I just never corrected Angela's Assumption about whose wedding it was. I showed up early to help set up chairs, and when Angela walked in with grant, she literally froze in the doorway. How was all she managed to say? Julie invited me. She's basically family. You knew? You never asked. The reception was absolutely brutal for Angela. Her co workers kept coming up to me looking concerned. Are you two separated? One asked. No. Angela just prefers bringing grant to weddings, I said loud enough for others to hear. Mother pulled me aside, looking uncomfortable. Is she having an affair with him? You'd have to ask her, I replied. By the time speeches started, the entire department was whispering and shooting looks at their table. Grant looked like he wanted to crawl under the table and die. Angela kept trying to do damage control, but every word made it sound worse. Her co workers exchanged these knowing looks that made her face turn red. Her boss found me during dessert and pulled me aside.

I tried to explain to the six armed officers that I didn't know anything about any murders, but my neighbor Karen held up her iPad, showing a Powerpoint titled Serial Killer Next Door evidence by Karen. She flipped to the first evidence slide, looking at me with a smug I got you this time, Beach Express. It began three months ago, Karen said, like a modern day Sherlock Holmes. She noticed I kept odd hours and had blackout curtains on all my windows. The first incident happened when she saw me dragging heavy black garbage bags to my car at two in the morning. The next day, she found red stains all over my driveway that looked exactly like blood. She started documenting everything for the safety of the neighborhood. He would have delivery trucks come to this house at night with tattooed men unloading large packages and body sized boxes. He took every single one down to his garage and came out with black bags once he's finished the job. Our other neighbors who had come out to check on the scene gasped at the horrific Powerpoint. Full pictures of the men, the suspicious truck, and me wearing protective eyeglasses and an apron stained with something red. Karen flipped through more extensive evidence. Photos of body parts visible through my garage window, recordings of Bonesaw sounds at midnight, even a video of me splashed with a Red liquid while holding a chainsaw. I'm telling you now. Oh, it's not what it looks like, I said, trying to hold back my laughter. Karen laughed. We're not blind. Don't even try to play your tricks on us. You're just another Jason wannabe. Jason Derulo? I teased. What the. No. Jason Vorhees from those horror films? You know what? Never mind. She flipped through more pieces of evidence. The ring doorbell recording of me handing over a red stain in suitcase to the delivery men, and a picture of a shrunken head in my car. When the officers saw the footage of a victim who sat in my living room, pale and unmoving, they panicked. Check the property. Start with the garage. Go! The officers entered my garage with weapons drawn and found mannequins on professional racks with latex limbs hanging to dry. They found containers of the red liquid labeled corn syrup mix Episode 6 and a toy chainsaw tagged testing zombie scene 4B. They clicked on different files from my computer, listening to different creepy sound effects and screams. Oh, hey, wasn't this on strange? Your things on something, one officer said, recognizing one of the props. He whistled at the three thousand dollar invoice attached. Another officer picked up the body part that was seen on Karen's Powerpoint and realized it was just foam latex. They brought out a few of them to the lawn. Karen's hands shook as she picked up the lightweight props. I Don't understand, she mumbled. That's when I explained everything. I used to work corporate until I lost my job. And I figured, you know, maybe I could start over, do something I really loved. So I got into special effects, became an artist. I loved horror movies and wanted to make

The bride's name isn't Susie. My best friend Janice was literally mid vow when Father Angelo raised his hand and said, I'm sorry, but I need to ask something. Where is Susie? Everyone in the church went dead silent because we all knew the bride's name wasn't Susie. The groom's face went white and Janice's voice cracked when she said, who's Susie? I stood there as maid of honor, holding her bouquet, watching her eyes fill with tears just thinking her fiance had another woman. An elderly woman in the back stood up and pointed directly at me. That's her! That's Susie! The whole church turned to stare at me, include putting my best friend Janice. But I was just as confused as everyone was in the room. My mom rushed out of her pew and ran to the altar before the old woman could finish walking down the aisle. Mom grabbed my arm, trying to pull me away from the ceremony. We need to leave right now! Janice grabbed my other arm, crying, did you sleep with my fiance? Mom tugged my arm harder. The old woman reached the altar and slammed her cane down onto the marble floor with a bang. Please let me speak to my granddaughter in peace before it's too late. The entire congregation whispered with questions and rumors. My mom hissed, stay away from us! Everyone stared at her like she was crazy. The Old woman ignored her, pulling out a travel sized photo album. This is your father holding you as a baby. This is you in my arms. This is our family. The kind looking man in the photos looked exactly like me. Same eyes, same hair color, even same smile. My mom tried to grab them, screaming, you have no right to do this here! This is a wedding! She deserves to know her father loved her and that he left this world trying to find her. She yelled back in a voice so clearly in pain that it made the entire church go quiet. My Grandmother's voice calmed. Your mother took you away when you were just a toddler. Changed her name, changed yours. But by some miracle, I found you. Now we can be complete again. She held out her hand with a soft smile. Please. I nearly grabbed it until my mom burst out with a horrifying truth. Took her away number. There was a restraining order against you. The church gasped, watching more drama slowly unfold. Ask her why, my mom demanded confidently. I looked at my grandma, whose face now changed from sweet and sympathetic to something cold and judgmental. She kept her mouth shut. My mom laughed. That's right. You can't say it, can you? Your grandmother drove your father to his last breath. She is the reason he's gone. And the reason I fled with you in my arms on the night before the Funeral. You poisoned him against his own family. My grandmother screamed back, slamming her cane against the floor again, this time with shaking hands. Even now you deny it. Right there at the altar, my mom announced the truth. My grandmother had refused to believe her son had bipolar disorder and needed medication. She kept telling him the doctors were wrong.

Growing up, my sister Kayla made everything about her. My birthday parties, she got gifts, too, because I wouldn't exist without her. Every graduation, every achievement hijacked. When I won the science fair in 8th grade, she convinced my parents to throw her a supportive sister party the same night. When I got into college, she announced her engagement at my Celebration dinner. When I graduated with honors, she showed up in a revealing red dress and spent the whole ceremony flirting with professors. The pattern never stopped. Kayla had this way of making herself the victim. Whenever I achieved anything, you're so lucky, she'd say. I sacrificed so much for you. Growing up. Meanwhile, I was the one babysitting her kids while she partied through her 20s. I was the one lending her money she never paid back. I was the one covering for her when she bailed on family obligations. When I got engaged to my Indian fiance, Priya, I was terrified Kayla would find a way to ruin it. Sure enough, at our engagement party, she immediately joked about wearing white to our wedding. It'll be so funny, she laughed, like in the movies, I'll be the mysterious woman in white. She even made this dramatic pose, hand on her forehead like some soap opera actress. I pulled her aside and told her, absolutely not. This is my one day. Kayla, please. She rolled her eyes and said I was being dramatic, that it was just a joke. God, you're so sensitive. It's not like anyone would actually confuse me for the bride. But she seemed to agree to drop it. Two weeks later, I found out she'd gone behind my back and asked Priya directly, your sister seems really excited about her dress choice. Priya mentioned casually over dinner, she kept asking about fabric and styles. My blood ran cold. I knew exactly what that meant. I freaked out on Priya explaining Kayla's entire history of stealing my moments. She did this at my high school graduation, wore this attention grabbing red dress and flirted with all the dads. My college graduation, she announced her pregnancy. She'll definitely show up in some elaborate white gown designed to make everyone look at her instead of us. That night, I had a complete breakdown, sobbing, hyperventilating. 28 years of suppressed resentment came pouring out. I was convinced Priya would see my toxic family dynamics and run for the hills. Who wants to marry into that kind of drama? Instead, she held me and said something genius. You know, white isn't the bridal color in Indian weddings, right? I froze. In all my panic about Kayla's manipulation tactics, I completely forgotten that crucial detail. Kayla had no idea Priya would be wearing a stunning red lehenga with intricate gold embroidery. Wedding day arrives. I'm getting ready with my groomsmen when my cousin Texts, dude, your sister just walked in looking like she thinks she's the bride. My stomach dropped until I remembered Priya's words. Then I actually started laughing. Kayla struts in wearing this elaborate white ball gown, strapless with a cathedral train, clearly custom made and expensive. She'd even hired a professional makeup artist, had her hair done in an elaborate updo with white flowers. The confused looks from Priya's family were absolutely priceless. Indian weddings are vibrant, colorful celebrations. And here's Kayla looking like she wandered in from a completely different century. During the ceremony, I kept glancing at Kayla. She looked increasingly uncomfortable as she realized everyone was staring at her for all the wrong reasons. Priya looked absolutely radiant in her traditional red and gold.

I came home from grocery shopping to find thirteen year old Adrian in the living room surrounded by the massacred remains of every single one of two year old Burt's beloved toys. Cotton stuffing everywhere like snow, fabric torn to shreds scattered across the carpet. Burt was screaming so hard his face was purple, while my husband stood over Adrian shouting she's lost her mind! Pointing at the destruction with a shaking finger. I was watching TV with Bert and she just started ripping apart every toy he owns like a psycho. I dropped the grocery bags and ran to pick up Bert, who is sobbing, trying to piece together his favorite teddy bear. Adrian, what have you done? She looked up at me with tears streaming down her face, holding something in her closed fist while my husband grabbed her hard enough to leave marks. Put something shiny in his mouth, she shouted, yanking her hand away from her father. I asked him where he got it and he pointed at his teddy bear. And when I looked inside, I found these. She opened her hand to show a diamond ring, a gold necklace, and several earrings. That's when my husband's face went from angry to a flash of panic. You had no right to destroy his toys over some costume jewelry, he quickly stammered. They were hidden inside the teddy bear, Adrian said, looking At me instead of her father, her voice trembling but determined. Burt could have to death. And I saw dad in here last week with his sewing kit, saying he was fixing rips. My husband laughed, but it sounded forced. I was fixing them because they were falling apart. And that's just jewelry I found at work during my security rounds, he said. I picked up one of the destroyed bears and found a small, neat slit in the back that had been hand sewn shut. The jewelry inside wasn't cheap like he said. It was real diamonds catching the light. You hid jewelry in our baby's toys? I asked. I was going to pawn it, my husband said quickly, but his voice was getting higher and sweat was beating on his forehead. Extra money for the family. You know how tight things have been. The elephant had three rings, the rabbit had a bracelet and earrings. The Dinosaur had a watch. Every single toy had something metal inside that could have killed bird if he swallowed it, Adrian said. You're being dramatic, my husband responded. I made sure the holes were secure, he then stammered. Why not just keep them in a drawer? I asked, staring at jewelry scattered across the floor. Why hide them in baby toys? My husband tried to grab the jewelry from the table, but Adrian was faster, pooping it up and backing away toward the wall. I know why he hid them in the Toys! Adrian said. Give those to me right now! My husband suddenly shot up, moving toward her with his hands outstretched. Adrian ran behind me, pressing against my back. This necklace has an engraving, Adrian said, her voice shaking as she held up a silver chain that caught the light. It says to Ruby, love, mom, on the back. Who's Ruby? I asked innocently. My husband's face started turning. And

Meanwhile, they threw my grandchildren's other grandmother, penny, a surprise 65th with 50 guests and a string quartet. I know because I saw the photos on Facebook. They captioned it, celebrating the world's best grandma. When I had hip surgery, I took the bus home because Brandon was slammed at work and couldn't leave.

Two months later, Kenzie's mother in law had her gallbladder removed. Kenzie moved in for three weeks. Brandon delivered groceries daily. They hired a private nurse. I watched their children for free every summer while they vacationed in Europe. 10 years of summers. No thank you, no payment. Just mom has nothing else to do. Anyway, they told friends childcare was taken care of like I was hired help. I missed my late husband Gio's sister's funeral because they already booked non refundable tickets. Kensley's mother in law babysits twice a year. They pay her $500 each time because her time is valuable. Christmas morning, I sat alone until 4 p m. Because they went to Kensley's husband David's family first. Traffic was bad, Kinsley explained. Though they live closer to me, my gift was a drugstore candle still priced at three dollars and ninety nine cents. Penny got a weekend spa retreat. I painted Kinsley's wedding portrait for three months. She left it in the basement untouched. Penny's blurry phone photo got framed in gold on the mantle. Kinsley asked me to cater her dinner party, then introduced me as the help when I stayed to serve. The next week, she hired a two thousand dollar chef for Penny's Book Club of six and then drove past my house to take penny grocery shopping during the ice storm that trapped me inside for four days. She doesn't like driving in bad weather, he explained. When I called hungry, neither do I. I said, you'll figure it out, mom. You always do. They started lying to maintain the favoritism. Kenzi told me Thanksgiving was canceled. Family flew. I delivered homemade soup to their door and saw Penny's car in the driveway and heard laughter inside. I walked back to my car crying. When Geo died, they invited penny to the family only viewing. I found out when she hugged me there, saying how honored she felt to be included in such an intimate moment. My own sister wasn't invited because Kenzi said immediate family only. Then something unexpected happened. Penny had been entertaining her country club with story. Kensley confided in her Brandon's fertility struggles, Kensley's anxiety medication, their financial problems. It exploded at a charity Auction. When her drunk friend asked Kensley about her little Prozac situation in front of everyone, Kensley discovered penny had been calling them my son's burden at her book club for years. The woman they'd chosen over me had made them her punchline. After Dio's funeral, I started teaching painting at the community center. Eight year old Manny arrived first. Suspended from school, his grandmother working doubles. I handed him a brush. He stabbed the canvas with rage, then returned the next day. Soon, seven neighborhood kids sprawled across my living room floor, turning feelings into colors. I invited Kensley to see Manny's first painting. Can't today, mom. Maybe later. Later never came. Brandon promised to attend our art show. He forgot. The kids started calling me Grandma D. Their parents invited me to every recital, game, graduation. I taught them Geo's cloud technique, while my own grandchildren didn't know I painted. Three years passed. Manny got into art school with our portfolio. Aisha painted a mural on my garage. Deshawn sold his first painting, bought me roses. My refrigerator bloomed with their art. My phone buzzed with goodnight, Grandma D texts. Meanwhile, I kept reaching out, offered Kinsley painting lessons for her kids there

Growing up, my sister Kayla made everything about her. My birthday parties, she got gifts, too, because I wouldn't exist without her. Every graduation, every achievement hijacked. When I won the science fair in eighth grade, she convinced my parents to throw her a supportive sister party the same night. When I got into college, she announced her engagement at my Celebration dinner. When I graduated with honors, she showed up in a revealing red dress and spent the whole ceremony flirting with professors. The pattern never stop. Kayla had this way of making herself the victim whenever I achieved anything. You're so lucky, she'd say. I sacrificed so much for you growing up. Meanwhile, I was the one babysitting her kids while she part through her 20s. I was the one lending her money she never paid back. I was the one covering for her when she bailed on family obligations. When I got engaged to my Indian fiance, Priya, I was terrified Kayla would find a way to ruin it. Sure enough, at our engagement party, she immediately joked about wearing white to our wedding. It'll be so funny, she laughed. Like in the movies. I'll be the mysterious woman in white. She even made this dramatic pose, hand on her forehead like some soap opera actress. I pulled her aside and told her, absolutely not. This is my one day. Kayla, please. She rolled her eyes and said, I Was being dramatic that it was just a joke. God, you're so sensitive. It's not like anyone would actually confuse me for the bride, but she seemed to agree to drop it. Two weeks later, I found out she'd gone behind my back and asked directly. Your sister seems really excited about her dress choice, Priya mentioned casually over dinner. She kept asking about fabric and styles. My blood ran cold. I knew exactly what that meant. I freaked out on Priya explaining Kayla's entire history of stealing my moments. She did this at my high school graduation. Wore this attention grabbing red dress and flirted with all the dads. At college graduation, she announced her pregnancy. She'll definitely show up in some elaborate white gown designed to make everyone look at her instead of us. That night, I had a complete breakdown. Sobbing, ventilating. 28 years of suppressed resentment came pouring out. I was convinced Priya would see my toxic family dynamics and run for the hills. Who wants to marry into that kind of drama? Instead, she held me and said something genius. You know white isn't the bridal color in Indian weddings, right? I froze. In all my panic about Kayla's manipulation tactics, I completely forgotten that crucial detail. Kayla had no idea Priya would be wearing a stunning red lehengas with intricate gold old embroidery. Wedding day arrives. I'm getting ready with my groomsmen when my cousin texts, dude, your sister just walked in looking like She thinks she's the bride. My stomach dropped until I remembered Priya's words. Then I actually started laughing. Kayla struts in wearing this elaborate white ball gown, strapless with a cathedral train, clearly custom made and expensive. She'd even hired a professional makeup artist and had her hair done in an elaborate updo with white flowers. The confused looks from Priya's family were absolutely priceless. Indian weddings are vibrant, colorful celebrations. And here's Kayla looking like she wandered in from a completely different century. During the ceremony, I kept glancing at Kayla. She looked increasingly uncomfortable as she realized everyone was staring at her for all the wrong reasons. Priya looked absolutely radiant in her traditional red and gold, surrounded by family and brilliant blues, greens and purples. While Kayla stood out like a sore thumb in stark white. But the absolute best part came during the reception. Priya's grandmother, this tiny eighty year old woman who'd flown in from Mumbai, walked straight up to Kayla. In her thick accent, she loudly asked, Zeta, why are you dressed for a funeral at a wedding? Did someone die that we should know about? The entire hall went silent, then erupted in

Growing up, Kenzie never let me forget my place in our friendship. Every party, every hangout, every introduction came with the same unspoken rule. I was the designated ugly fat friend who made her shine brighter. This is my friend who's really funny, she'd say, which everyone knew meant not pretty it every single time. Kenzie was gorgeous, I knew that. But her constant reminders made me believe I was worthless. Was I really that hideous? When I was 22, something shifted. I needed a physical outlet for my anxiety and found a group on for a rock climbing gym across town. The first day, my hands shook on every hold. But something about solving each route, finding my path up the wall, made me feel powerful. That's when I discovered my escape. I started climbing four nights a week in secret. My hands LED, then calloused. Ice my forearms after every session. Watch technique videos until 2:00am, practice grip strength exercises at my desk. Wednesday and Friday nights, I climbed with the regulars, including this guy, Sebastian, who became my climbing partner. We'd spot each other, celebrate sends, build genuine friendship through shared challenges. I never mentioned him to Kenzie. She wouldn't care about my gym friends anyway. Meanwhile, Kenzie had become obsessed with her marketing firm crush. She constantly prove I was the ugly friend by making me stand Next to her in mirrors. See the difference? She'd say, adjusting her hair. Some people just have it. Others are good listeners. She'd drag me shopping, hold up identical outfits against us both. This would look cute on me. You should stick to black. It's slimming. What killed me was how she document everything on Instagram, always cropping me out or positioning me behind her natural beauty. She'd caption photos where I was literally holding her phone's ring light. I started wondering if she was right. Maybe I was fooling myself, thinking climbing made me worth something. Kenzie's birthday party was approaching. This rooftop bar event she'd been planning for months. She'd invited her entire office, especially her crush. He finally rsvp'd. Yes! She squealed. I need you there. don't talk too much. Just laugh at my jokes and leave early if I give you the signal. The night of the party, she made me wear this shapeless black dress. It's so you. She lied. As guests arrived, she positioned me strategically. Visible enough to make her look charitable for having an ugly friend, hidden enough not to distract. Then her crush walked in with three friends. Kenzie grabbed my arm, whispered, remember your wallpaper? But when he scanned the crowd, his eyes stopped on me. His whole face lit up. Oh, my god, red! He called out, using my climbing nickname. Kenzie froze. Sebastian practically ran over his friends, trailing behind. Guys, this is the girl I've Been telling you about the one who sent that impossible 5 11 route last week? He turned to me, eyes bright with genuine excitement. I can't believe you're here. Wait. You know Kenzie. For the next hour, Sebastian couldn't stop talking about our climbing adventures. He told everyone about the time I helped him overcome his fear of overhangs, how I taught him this specific, like you hook technique, how watching me climb had made him a better athlete. His friends already knew stories about me. Sebastian had apparently been talking about his badass climbing partner for months. Kenzie stood there. Designer dress and perfect makeup useless against authentic connection. How long have you been doing this together? Someone asked. Six months, Sebastian said, then looked at me with this soft expression. Best six months of my week. Every week, Kenzie tried to interject, mentioning the marketing campaign they'd worked on together. Sebastian Bear

My mom has been begging me to put more thought into my appearance for as long as I can remember. I always ignored her because I thought I just look normal. But then she started insulting how I look every day. One morning she stood behind me at breakfast side dramatically and said, for God's sake, just do something different with your hair at least. It would make a world of difference. Just try something new, she pleaded. Anything would be more interesting to girls than this. She pointed to my ruffled head for some reason. That was the last straw. I said sure thing and headed to the bathroom with a new sense of purpose. I started small with a middle part and enough gel to make it look like plastic. Mom seemed pleased at first until she realized I'd used her expensive salon gel and the entire forty dollar bottle gone. It takes product to make changes, I reminded her when she found the empty container. She had to explain to her hairdresser why she needed more gel after one day, and the woman judged her hard for letting her teenage son waste professional products. The next week I went to her barber without telling her and got a perm. Not a settle wave, but a full 1980 style perm that made me look like a poodle. Mom had to Take me to her cousin's engagement party looking like I'd stuck my finger in an electrical socket, and everyone kept asking if it was for a school play. He's experimenting with his look, she explained weekly while her relatives took photos that would definitely end up in the family group chat. Then I discovered temporary hair chalk and started changing colors daily to match my outfits. Blue on Monday, red on Tuesday, purple on Wednesday, leaving colorful smudges on every pillow, towel, and headrest in the house. Mom's white couch looked like a rainbow had died on it, and she had to explain to guests why everything in our house was stained with pastels. Her car's leather seats were permanently tinted pink from the time I wore magenta in the rain. I showed up to her office when she forgot her lunch, sporting tiny braids with ribbon woven through them that I'd spent six hours creating. Her co workers tried not to laugh as I hugged her in front of everyone, leaving her blazer covered in the baby powder I'd used to make the braids look distinguished. Her boss asked if I was going through something, and she had to smile and say she encouraged me to express myself. The man bun phase was particularly rough for her, as I grew it out just long enough to make the world's smallest bun that stuck straight up like an antenna. She had to sit behind me at church while people watched My tiny bun wobble during hymns. The pastor's wife asked if I was becoming Buddhist, and mom had to have a whole conversation about religious tolerance. Then came the frosted tips. Except I didn't go to a salon and used actual cake frosting at first because I misunderstood the term. Mom found me in the bathroom covered in vanilla icing, and even after I used real bleach, my tips were orange instead of blonde. She had to take me to get school photos looking like Guy Fieri's younger brother, and those pictures would haunt us forever. I invested in a crimping iron and started crimping random sections so my head looked like I've been partially electrocuted. Mom begged me to stop, but I reminded her she wanted interesting and nothing was more interesting than asymmetrical crimp. Her mother came to visit and asked why mom was letting me walk around looking like I'd survived a lightning strike. The oils came next. So much hair oil that I looked wet constantly and left grease stains on everything I touched. Mom had to replace three pillowcases and explain to the

I'm a family court clerk, and last week the medinas were divorcing and fighting over who gets to keep the house, claiming the other was too financially reckless to own property. Both kept presenting evidence. He bought a year supply of healing crystals for our cat. He bought a boat. We live in Arizona. She hired a life coach for her succulent plants. Mediator Betty looked like she needed a drink at 9 a m. I'd like to hear from your daughter, since she's listed as a witness. Lola walks in dressed like a tiny accountant, dragging two suitcases and a filing cabinet. She looked like she was moving in permanently. Mediator Betty stares at the luggage mountain. Lola, we're just having a conversation. With all due respect, ma'am, you haven't met my parents. Going to need evidence. Can you tell us about your parents money habits? Lola opens the first suitcase and pulls out a binder. I brought three years of receipts. Receipts? Yes, ma'am. Filed under evidence. My parents shouldn't have credit cards. Betty almost spits out her coffee. Excuse me. Lola opens to a page with colorful charts. I've been tracking their spending since I was 11, ma'am. What kind of spending? Let's start with exhibit A. Lola holds up a next statement. This is Mom's fourth treadmill. She buys a new one every year because this one will be different. They're all in the garage. We Call it the treadmill graveyard. Exhibit B. Dad bought a three thousand dollar espresso machine. He only drinks instant coffee, ma'am. He thought it would inspire him to upgrade. Exhibit C. Mom orders Doordash from the restaurant that's literally next door. Last month she paid forty seven dollars for a twelve dollar sandwich. The restaurant is 40 feet away. And exhibit D, or dad belongs to three different gyms because each one has that special machine. He pays one hundred twenty dollars a month total. He goes twice a month. That's six. $60 per workout. Betty is covering her mouth. Lola, how did you start handling the money? Someone had to pay the electric Bill, ma'am. They kept forgetting it wasn't on auto pay. Lola opens the second suitcase. This is Mom's online boutique phase. She bought wholesale designer handbags from sketchy websites. Our garage looks like a knockoff purse museum. She sold exactly three bags. How. How much did she spend? $8,000, made $75 back. The mediator turns to the mom Missus, Medina. They looked real in the pictures. Lola continues. Dad's no better. He bought a truck to flip it. He put $5,000 of modifications on it. Damaged LED lights underneath that only light pink. And an attached disco ball inside. It's now worth less than before he bought it. May I present exhibit E. Lola pulls out two jars from the filing cabinet. This jar contains all the warranties dad bought that we've actually used. It's empty. This jar contains receipts for every warranty he's purchased. 83 warranties totaling $4,200. You never know when you'll need them. Dad protests. Dad, you bought a 3 year warranty on a 12 dollar phone case. The warranty cost 15 dollars. Lola pulls out a credit card Bill. Mom has a storage unit for her Amazon returns she never returned. She's paying 150 dollars a month to store things she doesn't want. I'll return them eventually. Mom, some of these boxes are from 2,018. What about your father? Betty asks. Dad bought a fishing boat. He gets seasick. He's used it once and threw up. He had to be towed.

My aunt literally hid her purse in her car trunk when she saw me walking up to my grandparents 60th wedding anniversary party. Through the window, I watched my uncle whisper something to his wife and she immediately took off her diamond earrings and shoved them in her pocket. 28 years old and my family still treated me like I was about to rob them blind because I got arrested for shoplifting when I was 15. The whole extended family was there for the anniversary Celebration, which meant I got to experience the full spectrum of their paranoia and disgust. My cousin made a big show of counting the bottles in the liquor cabinet loud enough for everyone to hear while staring directly at me, just making sure we know what we started with. He announced to the room like he was doing everyone a favor. My mother pulled me aside and whispered that she'd already warned everyone to keep their medications locked up because we can't be too careful with your history. I haven't touched anything stronger than coffee in eight years, but she still introduces me to people as her troubled one who's trying to get back on track. My uncle took it to another level when I walked past the room where they piled everyone's coats and he literally stood guard in the doorway blocking my path. The bathroom is the other direction. He Said with this smug little smile that made me want to scream. The anniversary dinner was even worse because they stuck me at the overflow table in the kitchen with the kids under 10, even though there were empty seats in the dining room. One of the teenagers asked why I was sitting with them, and my aunt loudly explained that sometimes adults need to provision 2, which got a huge laugh from the other room. While everyone else ate off my grandmother's China, I got a plastic plate because apparently I couldn't be trusted with anything breakable. My uncle kept walking through to check on things, which meant staring at me like I might pop get the salt shakers while his wife counted the silverware drawer right in front of me. Then my uncle decided to move my grandmother's antique mirror to the garage because he didn't trust me around something that valuable. He was carrying it through the dining room, making another speech about family heirlooms and personal responsibility when he tripped over his own grandson's toy truck and went straight through the sliding glass door. The mirror shattered and a huge shard went straight into his thigh while smaller pieces sliced his arms and neck. Bloods started spurting everywhere in these rhythmic pulses, and everyone just stood there screaming while he turned white and started losing consciousness. My aunt was freaking about calling 9, 1 1, but fumbling with her phone and dropping it in the blood While my mother fainted and my cousin vomited on the carpet, I jumped over the kitchen table and slid through the blood to get to him while ripping off my belt in one motion. Nobody touch anything and someone get me clean towels, vodka from the freezer and super glue from the junk drawer. Now I barked while using my knee to apply pressure above the wound. The femoral artery was nicked and he had maybe three minutes before he bled out. So I used my belt as a tourniquet while everyone stood there frozen. Another cousin finally brought supplies while I worked to stop the bleeding from his neck with one hand and maintained pressure with my knee. When the emts burst through the door seven minutes later, one of.

My best friend Claire was dying and needed me to make her a promise that would destroy my marriage. We were sitting in the hospice room while her three kids colored in the hallway when she grabbed my hand and asked me to adopt them after she was gone. Her boys were 11 and 9, and her daughter had just turned seven. Their dad had overdosed two years earlier, and with Claire's parents dead and her sister in Germany, there was nobody else. I wanted to say yes immediately, my husband had already told me that if I even considered taking them, we were done. Our son Caleb was 12 and severely autistic, requiring constant supervision that consumed our entire lives. My husband worked nights so I could work days, and we tagged each other like wrestlers because Caleb couldn't be left alone for five minutes without potentially hurting himself. We hadn't been on a date in three years or had a conversation that wasn't about therapy, schedules, or medications. Adding three traumatized kids would push us past our breaking point, and he had made it clear he would leave before letting that happen. But Claire was the only person who showed up when Caleb was diagnosed while everyone else disappeared. She brought groceries when I couldn't leave the house and watched him during meltdowns so I could shower, and never acted like we were A burden. The social worker visited the day after Claire died, and the visit went exactly as I expected. Caleb had a meltdown when she arrived and spent 40 minutes hitting himself while I tried to calm him down. My husband stood in the corner with arms crossed while the social worker took notes and asked how we would manage three additional children when we were clearly overwhelmed. He laughed out loud at that question and walked out, slamming the door so hard the picture frames rattled. The kids were in emergency foster placement for 72 hours, then would be separated into different homes unless family stepped forward to take them. The oldest had started wetting the bed and refusing to eat, while the middle boy wouldn't speak and just sat humming and rocking. The little girl kept asking when Mommy was coming back from heaven. My husband found me crying in Caleb's room and delivered the ultimatum I had been dreading since Claire asked for my promise. If you do this, I'm filing for divorce and seeking primary custody of Caleb because you're being irresponsible with his care. The words came out flat and mechanical, the way he processed anything too heavy to feel. Part of me understood, because Caleb would suffer if we tried integrating three grieving children into our controlled routine. But the oldest had memorized every Pokemon and could talk about them for hours, which would connect with Caleb's identical obsession. The middle child moved like A ghost and wouldn't disturb Caleb's need for predictability, while the little girl understood different meant special because Claire had taught her that these weren't random foster kids, but children who knew our house and called me Auntie with nobody else who even knew their middle names. The foster family called that night because the little girl wouldn't stop screaming and the oldest had tried running away twice looking for my house. The little girl's wailing came through the phone, begging for her mommy or me or anyone who smelled familiar. While the foster mother asked if I could fix this over the phone. My husband watched from the doorway as I lied that everything would work out when we both knew the system would swallow them whole. You can't save everyone, he said after I

Growing up, my brother Andrew could literally burn the house down, and mom would blame the matches. When he was 12, he actually did set our garage on fire trying to make a flamethrower. Mom's response was, boys will be boys. At least he's being creative. Meanwhile, I graduated valedictorian and she missed my ceremony because Andrew had a headache that day. Every morning, Andrew got gourmet breakfasts while I ate generic cereal. When report cards came out, my straight A's got a nod, while his C+ in math warranted a Celebration dinner because he really tried his best. Christmas mornings were the worst. Mountains of wrapped gifts for Andrew, practical stuff like socks and school supplies for me. When dad got cancer during my junior year, everything got worse. I was juggling AP classes, working at the library, and helping with dad's medications. Mom hired Andrew a private tutor so the stress wouldn't hurt his precious. The average I was staying up until 3:00am studying after spending hours cleaning up around the house. Dad passed two months before my graduation. Even then, mom barely acknowledged my valedictorian speech because Andrew was having a really hard time. He skipped the ceremony, entirely too emotional. So mom stayed home with him instead of watching me graduate. College was brutal. Despite dad setting up a fun for both of us, it mysteriously disappeared into medical bills. I scrambled for scholarships and loans while mom somehow found money to send Andrew to an expensive sports academy in Florida. He quit after three weeks because the vibe wasn't right. That program cost more than my entire freshman year tuition. I worked my behind off Dean's list every semester. Two part time jobs, living in a tiny apartment shared with three guys. Meanwhile, Andrew was home rent free, finding himself through expensive hobbies. Mom happily funded gaming setup worth $2,000 that's now collecting dust. Season tickets for his sports blogging phase that lasted two months. Fast forward 10 years. I'm killing it as a senior consultant. Finally paid off my loans, living in a nice apartment. Andrew is still at home at 28, trying to become a fitness influencer or whatever his latest phase is. Andrew started texting me about investment advice and business ideas. Mom calling more frequently, making comments about success for children, supporting their parents, sending me articles about family wealth management. I knew something was coming. Last Saturday morning, they show up unannounced. Mom pushes past me into my apartment, doesn't even wait for an invitation. First thing she does is look around like she's appraising the place. Nice setup you got here, she says, running her fingers along my coffee table. Must be doing pretty well for yourself. Andrew flops down on my couch like he owns it. Immediately pulls out his phone, doesn't even say hello. Then mom pulls out an actual spreadsheet. She sits down across from me and spreads it on my dining table like we're having a business meeting. I've been thinking about your family obligations. She starts. You owe me roughly $150,000 for raising you. Medical bills, school supplies, food, housing. I kept all the receipts. She's pointing to different lines on her spreadsheet. Completely serious. Plus, Andrew's got this amazing business opportunity. Fitness coaching app. Revolutionary concept. He just needs about $75,000 to get started. And with your connections, I'm sitting there listening to this insanity, thinking about all those years.

But now the truth came out. I was 22, just started my dream job as a mechanic, when my phone exploded with hate messages. My 16 year old cousin Sarah told everyone I've been sneaking into her room and got her pregnant. Nobody asked for my side. My mom screamed through tears that I was disgusting, asking how she raised such a monster. Dad just hung up on me. My sister Emma blocked me on everything without a word. Even my grandmother, who practically raised me after my parents divorce, hung up crying, saying she was too ashamed to talk to me. Sarah was the family princess. Straight A's, honor roll, church, youth group leader. Every Sunday, I was the high school dropout. Within 24 hours, the whole extended family had turned against me. My aunt posted these long Facebook rants about protecting our children from creeps hiding in our own family. My uncles were leaving voicemails, threatening to beat the hell out of me if they ever saw me again. Cousins I grew up with were sharing screenshots of our old photos with comments like, can't believe I trusted this creep. I waited every single day for police to show up with handcuffs. Every knock on my door made my heart stop. Every unknown phone number sent me into panic attacks, thinking it was detectives or lawyers. I lost everything, piece by piece. My job, At the auto shop because I couldn't focus. Kept making stupid mistakes, showing up late, calling in sick. My boss, Mike, finally sat me down after three months and said whatever was happening at home needed to stay there. But I was too broken to explain. Lost my apartment four months later when I couldn't make rent. Moved in with my buddy Jay Jake, who let me crash on his couch. But even Jake started asking weird questions when family never visited or called. Dude, where's your family? It's been six months and I've never seen a single relative. I made up lies about them living far away, being busy, having drama. Dating became impossible. How do you explain why your entire family disowned you? First girl I tried seeing asked to meet my parents after two months. I panicked and told her they passed in a car accident. She was so sympathetic it made me sick. Second girl saw through everything. When she noticed I had zero family photos in my apartment, no one to invite to anything. She asked Point Blank why I never talked about my family. When I couldn't give her a straight answer, she was gone by morning. Holidays destroyed me completely. Everyone else had somewhere to go, someone to call, someone who cared they existed. I drive past my old neighborhood and see all the cars in my parents driveway. Knowing they were all inside laughing and eating together without me. I finally moved 3 States away to Colorado and started completely over. New job at a different auto shop, new apartment, new friends who knew nothing about my past. For years, I lived like I had no family. Like I just appeared out of nowhere as an adult. Never dated seriously, because I couldn't risk anyone digging too deep into my background. Built walls so high, I forgot what it felt like to trust.

I slammed on the brakes and jumped out of my car. Nora, baby, what are you doing out here? She was shivering violently. And just her school clothes, no coat. Tears frozen on her little cheeks. Daddy locked me out. He said, I can't come back until you get home from work. My heart dropped. It was 9 p m. On a Friday. Jonathan knew I always worked late on Fridays. This wasn't an accident. How long have you been out here? Since you left this morning, she whispered. I scooped her up, feeling how ice cold her little body was, and carried her toward our front door. It was locked. I used my key. Fury building with every step. I found Jonathan exactly where I expected. Sprawled on the couch in his boxers and T-shirt, controller in hand, playing call of duty. The heat was cranked up to 75 degrees. Empty beer cans littered the coffee table. Why was our daughter outside for 12 hours? I tried to keep my voice calm. He didn't even pause his game. She spilled grape juice on my new controller this morning, I told her. Actions have consequences. I stared at him in disbelief. She's 6 years old, Jonathan. She spilled juice accidentally and you left her outside to freeze? Maybe next time she'll be more careful around my stuff. That's when I noticed Nora's pink backpack sitting by the front door. It was stuffed full, bulging at the seams. Her favorite stuffed bunny was sticking out the top. What's this? I pointed at the bag. Jonathan finally paused his game and turned to look at me. There was something cold in his eyes I'd never or seen before. I've been doing a lot of thinking today. While she was outside, he said slowly, this whole family thing isn't working out for me. Nor is too much work, too expensive, too loud. And honestly, I never wanted kids in the first place. The room started spinning. What are you talking about? I'm talking about you taking her and leaving tonight. I already had the locks changed while you were at work. You just got lucky I hadn't switched them out yet. I felt like I was in a nightmare. You're abandoning your own daughter? Nora was still clinging to me, her wet clothes soaking through my work blazer. She was listening to every word, her big brown eyes darting between us. Here's the thing. Jonathan stood up straight like this was all perfectly normal. She's not really mine anyway. I mean, yeah, biologically, whatever. But I never signed up for this dad life. You can have her. The casual cruelty in his voice made me sick. This was the man I've been married to for eight years. The man who used to read Nora bedtime stories. Jonathan, she's your daughter. You can't just watch Me. He picked up his phone. I already talked to my buddy Steven, who's a lawyer. Apparently, if I just voluntarily give up my parental rights, I don't have to pay child support either. Win, win. My hands started shaking, but not from fear. From rage. I pulled out my phone and speed dialled a number I'd hoped I'd never have to use. Hi, Christine, it's Caroline. Remember that emergency custody documentation we discussed months ago? File everything. Tonight. Jonathan's controller slipped from his hands. What are you doing? What you should have expected when you decided to mess with my daughter. I hit another number. Dad, it's happening.

My brother died six months before starting his surgical residency, and my parents decided I would live his life for him. Not metaphorically honor his memory or carry on his spirit, but literally step into every plan he'd made and complete them. If he never died, they transferred his residency spot to my name through connections at the hospital board. And when I protested that I was a year into my teaching certification, my mother collapsed, bobbing that she couldn't lose both children, and my father said the medical school had already processed the paperwork. The takeover started small with clearing out his apartment, but then my mother began forwarding his mail and scheduling his appointments in my calendar. She'd call, pretending to be me to confirm medical conferences, and she signed my name on volunteer shifts at the children's hospital where dying kids expected their favorite resident. My father installed a tracking app on my phone to ensure I was following the schedule he printed, which included 5:00am gym sessions and meal prep Sundays. Because that's what my brother did. They moved his entire wardrobe into my apartment while I was at work and donated all my clothes to charity. I kept accident making things worse by mentioning my actual life. I'm judging the science fair next month, I'd say at dinner, and suddenly my parents were calling my principal saying I'd had a family Emergency. Every normal thing I said became evidence that I was dishonoring his memory, so I Learned to speak only about hospital rotations I was faking and surgical techniques I'd googled. The first day at the hospital, I stood frozen during rounds while the attending asked me to examine a patient's abdomen. My hands shook as I pressed randomly, hoping high school biology would gave me. But the attending's face grew dark and he pulled me aside, asking if I was drunk because no medical student would check for liver enlargement on the wrong side of the body. I mumbled about grief affecting my performance, and he softened, saying my brother would be proud, while never knowing my brother was the only one who'd actually attended medical school. My girlfriend Meredith watched me transform into someone she didn't recognize as I canceled plans for fake emergency surgeries and spoken medical terminology I'd memorized from flashcards. She found me at 3:00am in his scrubs, sobbing over anatomy textbooks, trying to learn four years of medical school before morning rounds. Then my mother invited Eleanor, my brother's fiance, to dinner at my apartment, using my phone while I slept. I woke up to find her in my kitchen cooking my brother's favorite meal, wearing the engagement ring he bought because my mother told her I wanted to. Can you where he left off? Eleanor was crying happy tears, saying she knew my brother sent me to complete their love story, and she'd Already told her parents we were getting married on the date they'd originally planned. Eleanor, you need to leave right now. This is completely insane, I said, and my mother's face went white with rage. She's your brother's soulmate, and you're going to throw that away for some elementary school teacher who makes half what a surgeon's wife deserves? I teach middle school science, and Meredith is a software engineer, but that doesn't matter, because I not my brother, and I'm never going to be him, no matter how many times you make me wear his clothes or sleep in his bed or pretend to understand why the human pancreas does whatever it does. Eleanor dropped the ring and ran out sobbing, while my mother picked it up and tried to force it into my hand, saying the wedding was

Then her friend told me I'd make you mine tonight. She panicked for months. My situationship cried about how much she needed me for her birthday. I'd spent all morning decorating her place while she was at the spa I paid for. When she walked through the door and everyone yelled, surprise! She squealed and hugged every single person except me. Oh, my god, you guys are the best! She gushed, talking to everyone while I stood there holding the custom cake I'd ordered three weeks ago. She literally walked around me like I was furniture. She ignored me while I tried to wish her a happy birthday. When her cousin asked, who's that guy by the cake? She actually said, oh, that's just Harry. He helped out a bit. Helped out? I'd literally coordinated every single person in this room and paid for everything. You must be the famous Harry, said a voice beside me as I set the cake down. And to find her best friend, Ariel, who I'd heard about constantly but never met. She was visiting from Seattle for the party. Brunette with kind eyes. Famous might be a stretch, I said, watching her take selfies with everyone while I became invisible in her living room. Ariel followed my gaze. She always does this, doesn't she? Keeps people at arms length while making them think they're close. She pick up a champagne glass. I've watched her do it. Since college. You seem different, though. Let me guess, Ariel continued, studying me. You met on Tinder. She said she wanted something real. The first date was perfect, right? Told you she could see something special with you. I stared at her, stunned. How did you? Because that's her script, Ariel said simply. Same one she used on the last three guys. Did she cry about her ex ruining her ability to trust? Ariel's words hit something deep. Eight months of I need more time to figure out what I want. Eight months of being introduced as just my name. Eight months of watching her keep her options open while I closed mine completely. Last month, when I brought up being exclusive again, she cried, said I was pressuring her, that she thought we were perfect how we were. I'd apologized. Apologize? For wanting to be her boyfriend officially. You decorated this whole place, didn't you? Ariel said, looking at the rose gold theme. I spent hours perfecting because I knew it was her favorite. Her friends told me you coordinated everything, even drove to three different stores to find those specific balloons. I nodded, watching her show some guy her tinder matches while laughing with her cousin. She deleted tinder, right? Ariel asked. Of. Of course not, I said. She needs it for networking. You know what's crazy? Ariel continued. In all our calls, she's never once called you her boyfriend. But she loses it when you don't text. Back fast enough. The truth of it stung. Just last week, she'd shown up at my apartment at 2:00am, crying because I'd fallen asleep and missed her calls, convinced I was with someone else. Ariel moved closer, her voice dropping. I came here to visit her, but really, I wanted to meet you. She talks about you constantly, but only when she's worried you might leave. It's always Harry might be seeing someone else. Or Harry didn't heart my message. Across the room, I saw her notice us talking. She immediately stopped mid conversation with her cousin. I'm tired of games, Ariel said suddenly. I'm 28. I want something real. Someone who shows up, who puts in effort, who doesn't need

Now they want me to fund their retirement. So my parents had been saving money for all three of us kids to go to college since we were babies. My older brother and sister both used theirs, went to the local state school, lived at home, worked part time jobs at target, in the mall for spending money. I'm the youngest, and I was different. While they were partying in high school, I was grinding. 4.0 GPA, valedictorian, captain of the debate team, studying every single night because I had bigger dreams than staying local. Senior year, I got a full ride scholarship to one of the top engineering programs in the country. Full tuition, room and board, everything covered. When I asked my parents if I could use my college fund for other stuff, maybe a car or to help with living expenses, they called a family meeting. They sat me down at the kitchen table with this whole serious lecture. The money was specifically saved for education expenses. Since your scholarship covers everything and you don't actually need it, we're not legally obligated to give it to you. It wouldn't be fair to your brother and sister who had to work part time jobs during school. I tried explaining that I'd worked way harder than either of them, that I'd sacrificed my entire social life, that I was saving them literally tens of thousands of dollars they'd plan to spend. My dad Just shook his head and said, that's not how this works. Two months later, they used my college money, the money they've been telling me was mine my whole life, to completely renovate their kitchen and take the whole family to Disney World. When I said I wouldn't be joining them on the vacation, my mom said I was being ungrateful and dramatic. Fine. The day after graduation, I moved out. My uncle got me a job as a welder's helper on a pipeline crew. These were hardcore blue collar guys making serious money in brutal auditions. They all thought I was insane to give up that kind of cash to go sit in classrooms. But I showed up every day at 5:00am, worked in 100 degree heat, got my hands destroyed, came home exhausted. The welder I was paired with actually gave me a two thousand dollar bonus at the end of summer because he'd expect I did me to quit after three days. But I stuck it out. Did that same routine for three summers straight. School year, perfect grades, great professors, amazing friends. Summer back with the pipeline crew, banking every dollar while my siblings were doing internships at coffee shops. I was making more than most adults. Got a co op position my senior year that LED to a job offer. Graduated with zero debt. Started traveling the world for work. Been doing it for 10 years now. No wife, no kids. Just building my career. And saving money like crazy. Then last month, I get this call from my dad. Hey, buddy. Your mom and I are thinking about retiring early. We know you're doing really well financially, and we were hoping you could help us out a little bit. I asked how much my brother and sister were contributing to their retirement fund. Long pause. Well, you know, they both have families now. Kids are expensive. They really can't afford to help out right now. I couldn't help but smile. Dad. That's

I smiled. Like the movie with Katniss Everdeen? No, silly. It's when we see who cries first from being hungry. I never lose anymore, but Millie still does. Her little sister, maybe five, was sitting in the corner, clutching her stomach. How long do you play play this game? I asked, keeping my voice light. My record is three days. Ava beamed with pride.

Different rules here. While the other children arrived, I watched Ava carefully portion out food to her sister, whispering, eat slow so you don't throw up. My stomach turned. They've done this before. Ava, I said quietly, during snack time, does your mommy play the Hunger Game, too? Sometimes, but she cheats. I caught her eating crackers in the bathroom once. Daddy made her play for a whole week after that. She kept crying and saying she was sorry. But rules are rules. I excused myself to get more supplies and called CPS for my office. I have two children here showing clear signs of systematic starvation, I whispered urgently. The older one hasn't eaten in four days and thinks it's a game. Back in the story room, I sat close to the girls during reading time. Ava leaned against me and I could feel her ribs through her dress. Do you play other games at home? I asked. During craft time, the strong game, Millie piped up. We stand with our arms up until someone drops them. Ava nodded. I lasted two hours yesterday. Daddy says we're building character. She showed me the underside of her arms. Bruises lined them where blood had pooled. Sometimes we play the quiet game in the cold shower. If you make noise, you stay.

My dad missed my graduation for a job interview. Mom promised he'd make it, but kept checking her phone anxiously during the entire ceremony. I felt my heart sink when I scanned the crowd and didn't see his face anywhere. After walking across that stage, I gripped my phone, waiting for something. No texts, no calls. Complete silence. Mom couldn't look me in the eyes. When I found her afterward, she hugged me way too tight and whispered, he really tried, sweetheart. My chest burned with anger. I couldn't hide anymore. At my graduation party, relatives kept asking about dad. Mom cycled through increasingly desperate excuses. Traffic jam, work emergency, car trouble, each lie more pathetic than the last. I watched her stumble through explanations while my shame grew deeper. My friend Jake pulled me aside and asked, you doing okay, man? I just laughed and said, he's been doing this since I was 7 years old, because it was absolutely true. He missed my championship basketball game where I scored the winning shot. Missed my debate team finals when I took first place. Even missed my 18th birthday party last year. Said he had to work late again that night. After everyone finally left, I sat alone staring at my diploma. Mom tried approaching me, but I cut her off immediately. I said, grabbing my car keys, I've heard every excuse before. I drove to my old elementary school playground and sat on the Same swing where dad used to push me before work completely consumed his life. Before he became just a distant voice sometimes heard. Coming home at 2:00am, something inside me finally broke that night. All the anger I'd bottled up for years spilled over at once. I pulled out my phone and texted him. Congratulations on showing me exactly where I rank in your priorities. Message delivered. Read immediately. When I got home after midnight, Dad's car was sitting in our driveway. I found him hunched over our kitchen table. Head.

I was six beers deep at the hotel bar when Alan put $300 on the counter. Bet you can't give a toast at that wedding next door. We could hear the DJ through the wall asking for speakers. My girlfriend had just dumped me over text for never taking risks or putting myself out there. I've been telling my friends all night that I could charm anyone and Alan decided to test me. The guys all leaned in to see if I'd take the bet. The reception was at that point where they open the mic to anyone who wants to speak. My drunk plan was simple. I pretend to work with the groom and give a generic business guy speech. Rob told me dedication and commitment were perfect wedding words. The ballroom doors were open and people were walking freely between spaces. My shirt was wrinkled, but the lights were dim enough to hide it. I walked in from the hotel bar and when the DJ saw me approaching the microphone, he looked relieved that someone finally volunteered. I grabbed the microphone and a champagne glass from a passing waiter and told everyone I needed a moment outside because big moments get to me. While people smiled and nodded and the bride sat up to listen, I started with safe stuff about knowing the groom from work and watching him grow as a professional before pointing at the bride and saying this. Guy talks about you the way he talks about his biggest wins. Everyone laughed while the groom mouth thank you from his table with tears forming in his eyes. I kept going with generic lines about late nights at the office paying off. Remember those long nights when everything seemed impossible, I said, getting nods from everyone who'd ever worked late. Well, now you found someone worth losing sleep for. My voice cracked when I mentioned what makes a good partnership because that's what my ex said I couldn't do. But I pushed through and finished by saying they deserved all the happiness in the world. The room exploded with applause and the groom caught me in a huge hug saying it meant everything. Probably too emotional and drunk to wonder why he didn't remember me. And that's when Natalie walked up with dark hair and a smile that made me forget why I was there. She pressed a napkin with her purple penned number into my hand while saying, I work for the wedding planner and I've never heard such a beautiful toast from a business guy. And we ended up dancing for a few songs while my friends watched from the doorway in shock. During our last dance, Natalie asked, coffee sometime right in my ear and I said yes immediately. When my friends texted that the hotel bar was closing, she squeezed my hand making me promise to call before I left feeling better than I had In weeks, two weeks later, the bride tried to send me a thank you card but couldn't figure out who I was. The wedding planner pulled security footage and saw me walking in from the public bar and grabbing a glass from their reception waiter. The hotel banned me using my credit card information from the bar tab. That night, Natalie texted the planner.

Growing up, my parents had a unique approach to settling sibling disputes that I assumed was universal until college roommate conversations proved otherwise. Whenever my sister and I fought over something, a toy, TV choice, front seat privileges, my parents would immediately implement what they called the auction. They'd take whatever we were fighting about and announce bidding starts at 10 minutes. This meant we had to bid chore time to win the disputed item. My sister might open with 15 minutes of dishes, which I'd counter with 20 minutes of yard work. The bidding continued until one of us dropped out, unwilling to commit more chore time. The winner got the coveted item. The loser did nothing. But the winner had to complete their bid in short time before enjoying their prize. The genius part, if our parents suspected we were fighting just to get attention, they'd add auction minimums, starting bids of 30+ minutes. That made us quickly decide if the argument was actually worth it. By age 10, my sister and I had developed complex economic analyses of whether conflicts were worth the chore cost. We'd negotiate privately before even involving our parents because we understood the true price of disagreement. In college, I mentioned the auction to my roommates during a dispute over parking spaces. They stared at me like I'd suggested we solve it through ritual combat. That's when I realised most families don't run their homes like micro economic systems, teaching cost benefit analysis. As an adult, I recognise how brilliant it was. My parents never had to determine who was right. They simply created a system where we assigned our own value to our desires and paid accordingly. My sister and I rarely fight as adults. Everything seems negotiable after growing up with the auction.

Hi, everyone, I'm Sarah Miller, and my daughter Tiffany just transferred here today. The chat lit up with a string of welcomes and hellos. Just as I was about to type out my own greeting, a huge block of text appeared. Important notice from Tiffany's mom. Girls in the class, please take note. Starting next week, I'll be posting a picture of what my daughter is wearing each day. Please make sure your child doesn't wear the same thing. Also, I request that everyone please switch to the same brand of laundry detergent we use. My daughter has a very sensitive nose and can't tolerate other scents. Finally, my daughter was a C section baby and is a bit timid, so I ask you to tell your children not to bully her and make sure she's always treated with priority. Wow. I couldn't help but think, this isn't just a new student. This is a royal princess who's slumming it with us commoners. Some of the moms in the chat were quick to push back. Karen's mom are you serious? What my kid wears is none of your business. Why should we have to cater to you? Jessica's mom exactly! And we're supposed to all use your detergent? My son has allergies, too, and we use specific stuff. Yeah, who made your kid the queen of the class? My kid is special too. The Chat quickly devolved into a debate. Usually I just chuckled at the ridiculous things these parents said in the group chat. The class teacher was the administrator, and she'd usually step in to calm things down. I didn't see a problem, so I just muted the chat to get some work done. Then I got a DM. It was from Alyssa, whose daughter Emily was friends with Lily. Hey, Sarah, you got it.

Yeah, he bought it from some guy on Craigslist about 3 months ago, but I'm the one who drives it mostly now, since I just got my license. The mechanic wiped his hands on a rag and walked me around to the front of my Subaru Legacy, while my dad waited in the shop's lobby, scrolling through his phone, probably answering work emails. We'd brought the car in for a simple oil change, but the mechanic had been under there for way longer than normal, and now his face looked like someone had died. He popped the hood and pointed a flashlight at something underneath that I couldn't really see from where I was standing, but his hand was trembling. You need to get your dad over here right now. And nobody drives this car again until we fix this. His voice was steady, but there was something in his eyes that made my stomach drop, like when you miss a step going downstairs. Someone wanted you dead, and they almost succeeded. Another day or two of driving this thing and you wouldn't be standing here. What's wrong with it? I asked. Well, texting my dad to come outside immediately, but the mechanic was already taking pictures with his phone and muttering about calling the police, which made no sense for a car repair. My dad pushed through the door, looking annoyed because he'd Been in the middle of a work hall. But his expression changed when he saw the mechanic's face. The mechanic grabbed a trouble light and aimed it at the brake lines near the master cylinder, showing us cuts that went almost all the way through the metal. These were sliced to leak slowly over weeks, so when they finally failed, it would look like a magic accident that nobody would question. He moved the light to show three different cut points, all at calculated angles that would have failed simultaneously. Professional job. But they made one mistake. They used a specific cutting pattern I've only seen once before. My dad's face went white as he stared at the sabotaged brake lines. And I remembered last week when I'd slammed the brakes to avoid a dog and felt them go completely soft for a terrifying second before catching. The mechanic kept staring at the cuts like they were a signature, and then walked to the car's rear bumper, where there was a faded church sticker. Was there a Saint medallion hanging from the rearview mirror when you bought it? My dad nodded slowly, and the mechanic's hands started shaking worse as he stepped back from the car. This belonged to my sister Nina, and that cutting pattern is exactly how her husband Greg showed me to slice fishing line when we went deep sea fishing last year. He pulled out his phone and started scrolling through photos until he found one Of this exact car in a driveway with the same dent in the passenger door. She sold it without telling him because she was leaving him after he put her in the hospital twice, but he must have thought she still had it. The and it called someone, and I heard him say frantically, Nina, you need to get out of that apartment right now. Greg knows where you are, and he already tried to kill you once. My dad called 9 1 1, while the mechanic stayed on with his sister, telling her to pack nothing and just drive to the police station immediately. The officers arrived fast, with their lights flashing, and treated our car like an attempted murder scene, while the mechanic explained that Greg had been escalating his violence, and had told multiple people at their church that if he couldn't have Nina, nobody would, especially not some other man. The detective examined the brake lines with gloved hands and confirmed this was designed to fail catastrophically at high speed, probably while going downhill or merging onto the highway. The way these are cut, you'd have about two seconds of pumping the pedal before total brake failure, at which point most people would already be in a fatal collision. He looked at me and asked if I'd noticed anything unusual.

Megan grabbed my arm while we were shopping for jeans and whispered, don't turn around. But is that guy following us? I glanced over my shoulder and saw a man in a gray hoodie looking at his phone that was angled toward us. We noticed him earlier in the food court, then again at Sephora. We decided to test it and left, suddenly walking toward Forever 21. And there he was at the escalator. Now my heart was racing. Megan said we should go to security, but I felt stupid because what would we say? That some guy was shopping in the same stores? We couldn't see his face clearly under the hood, and he wasn't doing anything obviously threatening, just existing near us. We ducked into the crowded store and wove through racks of clothes trying to lose him. I saw him enter and stop near the entrance, scanning the store systematically row by row. We crouched behind a display and Megan whispered, why would someone follow us? What if he's some creep who saw us and just decided we were easy targets? That my skin crawl. We waited until he moved deeper into the store, then slipped out the side entrance. We speed walked toward the department store, figuring we could cut through to the parking garage. My hands were shaking as I texted my roommate where we were just in case something happened. We made it To the department store and started weaving through the makeup counters, past the jewelry, toward the back exit. I was starting to breathe normally again when Megan froze. He was there again, coming through the main entrance, moving faster now, like he knew we spotted him and didn't care about being subtle anymore. We ran toward the back exit, and I could hear footsteps behind us, not running, but walking fast, steady, deliberate, like he we couldn't really escape. An employee asked if we needed help, and I wanted to scream yes, but Megan pulled me along, saying, the exits right there. We burst into the parking garage, and the temperature dropped instantly. Cold concrete and shadows everywhere. Ran toward where I parked on level 3. I fumbled for my keys while we ran, my hands shaking so bad I dropped them and they skittered across the concrete. Megan grabbed them and we reached my car in a dark corner where I parked that morning. She clicked the unlock button, but nothing happened. She tried again, pressing it desperately, but still nothing. The battery in the key FOB must have died. I grabbed the keys to manually unlock it, but my hands were shaking too much to get the key in the lock. That's when we heard the garage door slam open behind us, the sound echoing off every surface. He was coming, walking straight towards us with purpose. I finally got the key in, but it wouldn't turn like The lock was jammed or frozen from sitting all. Megan was pulling on the door handle frantically, saying, come on, come on, come on. He was getting closer, steady footsteps echoing off concrete. And now he was speeding up, almost jogging. I was fighting with the key, trying to force it, and it finally turned, but the door wouldn't open. Something was wrong with it, stuck or broken.

So I said, try me. My girlfriend Irene had this theory about me and my best friend Lance. She brought it up during game night at our place when she'd had too much wine. You know what's funny, Jonah? She said with a nasty smile. You're so pathetic, I could literally f lance in our bed. And you'd probably apologize to him for being in the way. Everyone went quiet. Lance's fiance, Marina, looked double. I told her to stop being weird. I'm serious, Irene continued, as if she hadn't just said something insane. You're so scared of confrontation, you'd rather lose your best friend than admit your girlfriend crossed the line. Lance tried to change the subject, but Irene kept going. I could probably seduce him right in front of you and you'd find a way to blame him for it. Men always blame each other. Never the woman. I set down my cards and look at her. That's sick, Irene, she laughed. But it's true. You're too weak to stop me and too pathetic to leave me. Marina said we should call it a night. As everyone left, Irene whispered, I could prove at any time. I said, go ahead. Try. The next few weeks, Irene started testing boundaries. She'd text Lance about random things, always screenshotting his polite responses to show me. See how quick he answers. She'd say she Started dressing differently when we hung out with them. Touching Lance's arm when she laughed, sitting too close on the couch. Marina noticed, Lance noticed, everyone noticed. But nobody said anything because. What do you say? That's when I texted Lance privately, told him I had enough with everything he was saying. He was also really pissed. Marina was furious that she hadn't stopped. They wanted to confront her immediately, but I had a different idea. Let her try whatever she was planning, but be ready. Document everything. Show everyone who she really was. Then Lance announced his birthday party plans. Just close friends at his and Marina's apartment. Irene immediately said, perfect. Maybe I'll give him a special present. She spent two hours getting ready, wearing a dress I'd never seen before. At the party, she started drinking immediately, working her way closer to Lance with each drink. I watched her watch me, making sure I saw every move. She'd touch his chest, look at me, laugh at his jokes, look at me. Around 10 p m, she made her move. Lance went to his bedroom to grab his jacket for Marina, who was cold. Irene followed him, giving me one last smirk before disappearing down the hallway. Marina had excused herself. Five and it's earlier. Hiding in their walk in closet with her phone ready. I stayed in the living room, listening. Irene's voice carried through the walls. Marina doesn't have to know. Jonah is too weak to Do anything anyway, he'll blame you, not me. That's what weak men do. Lance's voice came next. Irene! Get off me! What are you doing, then? Louder! I said stop! This is assault! Come on. No one has to know if you don't. That's when Marina stepped out of

I always thought my older brother Kyle was just a tech geek. He spent hours in our garage working on what he called projects, building computers, fixing phones, that kind of stuff. Mom and dad were proud of his skills. He was 19 and I was 12, so I mostly stayed out of his way. But something felt off about Kyle. He always seemed to know things he shouldn't. Like when I told my friend Jake a secret over the phone in my room, Kyle would make weird comments about it the next day. Or when my sister Emma practiced her dance routines alone, he tease her about specific moves she'd messed up. At first, I thought he was just good at guessing. Everything changed on a Tuesday after school. I was looking for my phone charger and decided to check the air vent above my bed where I sometimes hid stuff. That's when I felt something that didn't belong. A tiny black camera no bigger than a quarter stuck to the inside of the vent with electrical tape. My hands were shaking as I pulled it out. There were thin wires running from it that disappeared deeper into the ductwork. Followed the wires outside to where they LED straight into Kyle's garage workshop. That night, I waited until Kyle went to his friend's house. I snuck into the garage and nearly threw up at what I found. Three computer Monitors sat on his workbench, each showing live video feeds. One showed my room. Another showed Emma's room. The third showed the hallway right outside our bathroom. I watched myself sleeping from the night before on one of the recorded files. Kyle had been watching me for who knows how long. Next morning, I cornered Kyle in the kitchen while mom was getting ready for work. I found your cameras, I said, trying to keep my voice steady. Kyle didn't even look surprised. He just grinned and kept eating his cereal. Don't be so dramatic, Liam. It's just for fun. I like knowing what's going on around here. You're spying on us. That's sick. It's not spying if it's my own house, he said, laughing. Besides, what are you gonna do about it? I told mom and dad. That afternoon, Kyle spun some story.

When I turned eighteen, my parents sat me down for what they called a long overdue conversation. You need to move out, mom announced. Every disaster in this house happens because you're constantly provoking Gonzales. I stared in disbelief while my 14 year old brother Gonzales sat there looking innocent. The kitchen fire last week, the destroyed laptop, the hole in the garage door. It's always when you two are together. We need peace. You have two weeks to find somewhere else to live. Gonzalez smiled sweetly. I just want our family to be safe, he said, hiding behind my parents backs as he mouth goodbye. Fine. If they wanted me to stop protecting them from Hurricane Gonzalez, I'd wish them good luck. The day after I moved out, Gonzalez decided to upgrade the house's electrical system. Every light in the neighborhood now flickered in rhythm with our toaster. When mom tried to make toast. It activated the garage door, the ceiling fans, and somehow started Dad's car. The power company had to shut down our entire grid and rewire our house. The Bill was $3,000. It's synchronized living, Gonzalez explained proudly to the electrician. Next, he discovered online chemistry tutorials without me. Secretly replacing his chemicals with baking soda, he created what he called rainbow smoke bombs in the kitchen. But they were actually just straight up acid that ate through the tiles and corrupted all the food. Hazmat had to gut our kitchen entirely. Total cost $8,000. Why didn't you tell us this would happen? Mom yelled at me through the phone. I did. You just never listened. I reminded her. Then Gonzales revealed he'd been training squirrels in the attic. They're my army, he explained, as 20 squirrels wearing tiny tin foil hats ended through the ceiling during Dad's Zoom meeting with his boss. Dad got fired on the spot. Then came the car improvement incident. Gonzalez filled Dad's gas tank with what he called Super Juice, a mixture of energy drinks, lighter fluid, and glitter. The car made it exactly 12 feet before the engine shot through the hood like a rocket landing in our neighbor's pool. The neighbors

Savannah had been stealing my moment since we were kids. At my 10th birthday, she blew out my candles to help me. At my high school graduation, she wore white and told everyone we were both graduating, even though she was a sophomore. At my engagement dinner, she spent the night telling Nathan's family how she introduced us, even though they met at work. The cancer diagnosis was just another moment for her to steal. Two days after my diagnosis, Savannah moved into our house without asking. She made a Caringbridge page but wrote everything from her perspective. Every post started with how hard it was for her to watch me suffer. Friends praised her dedication while I spent hours throwing up from chemo. Three weeks in, I asked if Nathan could drive me to appointment. Sometimes she started crying and said I was pushing her away during the hardest time of her life. She posted about how sick people lash out at caregivers. Nathan said I should apologize. By month 2, she reorganized our entire house. I moved Nathan's things to the guest room and started screaming my calls. She turned away visitors, saying stress would hurt my recovery. She joined Nathan for evening runs to discuss my care. They'd come back sweaty and avoid eye contact. Four months into treatment, my white count dropped and the nurse sent me home. Early, I took an Uber because Savannah had our car for shopping. I heard voices from our bedroom and climbed the stairs slowly. When I opened the door, they were in my bed. Savannah was wearing the anniversary pajamas Nathan bought me. She jumped up wearing my robe and rushed over with fake concern. She asked why I was home early and said I must be confused from the medications. She. I actually told Nathan to call my nurse about hallucinations. He just sat there in his boxers while she performed. My legs gave out. I slid down the door frame, realizing she'd stolen my husband while I was fighting cancer. Nathan finally said, I've been distant and Savannah understood his stress better. He compared his stress to my cancer. They moved out next week. Savannah told everyone I'd become paranoid from treatment. She posted about watching loved ones lose themselves to illness. People praised her for setting boundaries. Most friends believed her. I finished three months of treatment alone. No one cheered when I rang the bell. I recorded it myself but deleted it that night on my bathroom floor. I decided Savannah had stolen from me my whole life. This time would be different. During recovery, I studied Savannah's patterns like I was planning a battle. I made fake social media accounts to track her posts and learn her routines. Found out she had joined a fancy yoga studio and was flirting with her married instructor. She worked At a marketing firm downtown and volunteered for their charity events. She and Nathan had rented a condo near the river. I mapped out her entire life and looked for weak spots. Joined her yoga studio but went to different class times. I became friends with the instructor's wife at the juice bar next door. We bonded over books and recovery stories without me mentioning Savannah. When Savannah started asking for private sessions, his wife was already suspicious. She found their text messages and confronted Savannah in the packed studio lobby. She read every flirty message out loud. While Savannah tried to cry her way out, the entire studio turned against her. Next, I joined the board of her company's charity foundation as a cancer survivor advocate. At their annual gala, I gave a speech about finding strength during treatment. I started by describing the loneliness of chemo and how cancer strips away.

I was 9 when my mom left me at Walmart, not by accident. She literally told me to sit on the bench by the entrance and wait while she went to get stuff from her car. I waited three hours. A store worker named Beth found me there when the sun was going down. She had this worried look and asked where my parents were. I told her my mom said she'd be right back. Beth called security, then the cops. Mom showed up 20 minutes after the police arrived. No panic, no tears, just annoyed that I made a scene. She told the officer she forgot I was there because she had errands to run, like I was a grocery bag she left behind. Cop looked at her weird and asked how you forget your kid. Mom just shrugged and said kids are supposed to stay where you put them. That wasn't even the worst part. Two weeks later, she did it again at the mall. This time I waited four hours until mall security found me asleep on a food court chair. When mom finally came back, she was carrying shopping bags from stores that weren't even in that mall. She'd literally gone somewhere else entirely. The security guy was pissed. He asked if this happened before and I told him about Walmart. His face went red and he made my mom sit there while he called someone. I don't know who, but afterward, mom was really quiet on the drive home. At home, dad was watching t. V. Like nothing happened. When I told him what happened, he just said, your mother's got a lot on her mind. Like that explained leaving your kid places. Third time I was ready. We went to target and mom pulled the same move, but this time I followed her to the parking lot and watched her drive away. I went back inside and found the customer service desk myself. The lady there was super nice. Her name was Carol and she gave me a juice box while we waited. When mom came back, two hours.

Every August for like six years, I host this huge end of summer party in my backyard. It's basically become the neighborhood event that everyone looks forward to. Kids run around screaming with popsicles. Parents drink beer and complain about going back to school shopping. And by 9:00, the little ones are dragged inside to sleep while the adults keep the party going until like midnight. My house is literally right next to the backyard, so when my kids, Mia and Tyler, get tired, I just take them upstairs, tuck them in and leave the bedroom window open so I can hear everything going on outside. They have my old iPhone, too, so if anything happens, they can just text me. It's worked perfectly for years. This year, I invited my boyfriend, Kevin, and his two kids, Emma and Jake. We've been together for 6 months, which felt like long enough to include them in my tradition. But when I explained how the night usually goes, Kevin's face got all weird. He said he wasn't comfortable with his kids sleeping at my place since they'd never stayed over before. Okay, fair enough. Then he said he didn't like the idea of putting them to bed while he stayed outside with me. didn't want to leave early with them while I stayed at my own party. Basically, nothing about my setup worked for him. Told him I totally understood and that they didn't have to come. Like this isn't some random hangout I threw together last minute. This is an annual thing with a format that works for everyone who's been coming for years. If it doesn't work for you, then don't come. No big deal. But Kevin lost his mind, started saying that he and his kids weren't actually welcome because of how I set everything up, that I should have changed the whole party just for them, that any good girlfriend would leave her own party early to put his kids to bed and stay with them. The party happened without them. It was actually amazing. Missus Chen from next door brought her famous potato salad. The Henderson kids had a water balloon fight that soaked half the adults. And Around 10:30, when all the kids were asleep, we played music and talked until almost 1 in the morning. I didn't think about Kevin once until my phone started buzzing. He'd been texting me all night asking why I wasn't calling him, said I should have made time during my own party to check in with him, that he felt left out and ignored. I saw the messages when I was cleaning up and just put my phone away. The next day he came over and we had this massive fight. He kept saying I chose my neighbors over him and his kids, that I prioritized some stupid tradition over our relationship. That if I really cared about him, I would have either changed the party format or left early to spend time with them. I, I told him that was insane. This party happens one night a year. Everyone knows the deal. His kids would have had fun until bedtime and then they could have gone home or figured something else out. But changing a six year tradition for someone I've been dating for six months, making all my neighbours adapt to his comfort level, leaving my own party early, not happening. He said I was selfish and not ready for a real relationship with someone who has kids. But I clearly wasn't thinking long term about us if I wasn't willing to make adjustments. I said maybe he was right because someone who expected me to completely rearrange my life after six months probably wasn't someone I wanted to think long term about anyway. We broke up. Two days later, he sent me this long text about how I'd realise what I lost when I was alone at next year's party.

My son turned eight last Saturday and his mom threw him this huge party at her parents house with bouncy castles and a magician, probably 50 people there. I showed up with my gift wrapped in newspaper because I couldn't afford wrapping paper. And my ex wife's sister actually laughed out loud when she saw it. Her husband pulled me aside and said I should be embarrassed showing my face here when everyone knows I'm three months behind on child support and asked if I even knew what grade he was in. I wanted to tell him that I actually knew his teacher personally because I've been volunteering at his school every lunch hour. But instead I just stood there and took it because arguing would just make everything worse for my boy. The whole party was basically two hours of my ex wife's family taking turns humiliating me while I tried to stay invisible near the fence. Her mom kept making these loud comments about how some fathers actually provide for their children. And her dad walked past me carrying my son's new bike and said maybe someday I could afford to buy my child something that didn't come from a thrift store. When they brought out the cake and my son wanted me to stand next to him for photos, his grandmother literally stepped in front of me and said they wanted pictures with people who were actually Part of his life. I watched my boy's face fall and it took everything in me not to say something, but I knew they'd just use it against me. Court, my ex wife's aunt asked me directly in front of everyone if I was still working that pathetic warehouse job or if I've been fired from that too. And when I said I was still there, she said at least my son would learn what not to become. My ex wife stood there telling her cousins that I lived in some disgusting studio apartment and probably spent my child support money on beer while her sister nodded along and said some people just aren't meant to be fathers and that's okay. That's when a Grace Dan pulled up and this exhausted looking woman got out carrying a thick folder and walking straight through the party toward me like everyone else was invisible. She looked distressed and said she was sorry but this couldn't wait another day because the state was threatening to pull the placement if she didn't get the inspection done immediately. My ex wife's mom immediately stepped forward and demanded to know who this woman was and what the hell she was talking about. The woman said she was from Child Protective Services and she needed to inspect my home for the foster placement renewal and verify the twins were still thriving. My ex wife's sister went completely white and whispered, what twins? The social worker flipped through Her papers and said she was talk.

My older sister is super jumpy. Like, she gets scared if the toast pops up too loud. So when I found out she'd been watching creepy sleepwalking videos all week, I saw my golden opportunity. One night, I stayed up late and waited until I knew she was asleep. Then I slowly opened her bedroom door, walked in barefoot with my eyes half closed, and started mumbling random garbage like, the bees are listening. They can smell light. She's full panic. I pretended to snap out of it like I didn't know what was going on. And the next morning, I told her I had no memory of it. That's what really got her. She was convinced I was actually sleepwalking. So I did it again the next night. This time, I stood at the end of her bed holding a spoon and just. I am the cereal. I was holding myself from bursting out laughing. After that, she started locking her door, so I got creative. I'd rattle the doorknob or just whisper her name through the air vent until she freaked out. I kept telling her I didn't remember any of it. My acting was elite. She even started filming me to prove it was real. But I would just delete the videos when she wasn't looking. It became this little war. Honestly, it was the most fun I'd had in weeks. I never meant to actually Scare her. Just mess with her a little. But then one night, she ran into my room looking pale and said, I need to show you something right now. I followed her down the hall, thinking it was just another one of her over reactions. she opened her phone and pulled up a video from the night before. The footage showed her room in the dark and a figure slowly pushing the door open. Me? Or someone that looked like me. I watched the figure step into her room, stand completely still for a full minute, then start whispering. But it wasn't gibberish this time. It was my name. Over and over, whispered slowly, almost like. Then it tilted its head and said, I know you're awake. That's when the video cut out. I tried to laugh it off and said, okay, I admit it. That one was actually kind of good. But she didn't laugh. She looked at me and said, that wasn't from last night. That was from the night you slept over at Sam's house. My stomach dropped. I'd spent that night two neighborhoods over, crashing on my friend's couch. I pulled out my own phone to double check the text. There it was. A message from me at 11:08 saying, crashing here tonight. Tell mom that video was recorded at 203:00am. I stared at the screen and tried to find some logical explanation. Maybe someone was messing with us. Maybe she faked the whole Thing. But then she said, I didn't want to tell you, but a few nights ago, I saw you standing in the hallway. I called your name and you didn't answer. You just walked into the bathroom and never came out. When I checked a minute later, the light was off and the room was empty. That was the part I couldn't explain, because I remembered.

When the doctor told me surgery or death, and my boyfriend drew told me to start digging my own grave. However, he'd soon come to regret it. I was sitting in the office after finally going in for the stomach pain I've been ignoring for months. This could have been prevented if caught earlier, he said, looking at my chart. When was your last checkup? Four years ago. I couldn't afford it. I have insurance, but I needed every penny for rent, bills, my boyfriend's art studio. The doctor frowned, tapping on a clipboard. I see. Well, the surgery will cost about $5,000 with your coverage. 5,000? I felt the air get knocked out from my lungs. Maybe next time, doctor. I can still handle it. He gave a worried look before signing the release papers. But three steps from the hospital door, I felt a sharp pain zapped through me. I dropped to my knees on the asphalt and coughed up blood. The security guard radioed for help, and they rushed me back on a stretcher. You're bleeding internally. If we don't operate soon, this could rupture. I frowned and gave them Drew's contact. Think he'd understand? Just this once? The nurse stayed with me while they prepped more paperwork. So you handle all the bills? She asked with a disgusted expression, after I'd explained our situation. Well, when drew makes it big, it'll All come back like an investment. The nurse couldn't help but roll her eyes at my answer. And how long has he been not making it big? Six years. And how many of these artworks has he sold? Nothing yet, but he's close to a breakthrough. His mentor says he has talent, but I think this time I might have overdone it. I work 60 hours a week, two jobs. I haven't bought new clothes in three years. I'd love to go to a salon one last time before, you know, I pass away, I said bleakly, laughing at my own terrible situation. You need to take care of yourself too, honey. She touched my hand gently. What does your partner contribute exactly? I opened my mouth and closed it. He contributes. He's following his passion. I'd like to show him my passion. My passionate fists, she mumbled to herself and smiled. All right, you rest up. She left the room, still clearly upset at my story, but it felt nice having someone worry about me for once. Drew arrived two hours later, looking annoyed. This is really bad timing. I have a studio session with my mentor. The doctor explained the situation again. The urgency, the cost. Drew's face lit up. Actually, this is perfect timing. What? I asked, shocked at his happy tone. We have exactly 5,000 saved, right? Well, my mentor knows a gallery owner, and I can finally book my first show. I stared at him. From the hospital bed. But that money is for my surgery. Yeah, but we could get a loan for that, right? This is my one shot, drew. I'm dying. He looked at me with a raised eyebrow and an expression that screamed, so what? I snapped. No, I said calmly. What do you mean, no? The heart monitor slowly started rising. Six years, drew. I've paid for your life for six years. And now when I plan on choosing myself for once, you tell me not to. But it's not just a gallery. It's my dream. I tried to fight back my tears, but couldn't hold them. Your dream over my life. All this time, I've just been some sponsor to your dream. An open bank account. As working 60 hours is easy. It's not. I'm tired. So tired, drew. I said I'd pay it all back. He yelled. I laughed. When? Well, when? My art gallery. If you had to choose now, what would it be? My surgery or your gallery? Drew stood there with his mouth gaping open, acting as if it was a difficult question. I can't believe you're making me choose. That's, um, gaslighting. Choose. Drew paced back and forth nervously. This isn't fair. My mentor said this gallery could really change everything for me. Uh, for us. I said, choose. I'll come check on you after my show. He took my wallet from my back and walked out.

Three years ago, when I first met my husband, Greg's mother, Mallory, she made her famous tuna casserole with crushed potato chips and mayonnaise that had definitely seen better days. The smell alone made my stomach turn. But she stood there watching me take that first bite with such hopeful eyes. I couldn't crush her heart like that. So I smiled, forced it down, and said it was delicious. That single moment of kindness became my prison. Now, three years into our marriage, edge, Mallory brings food over twice a week, always in those same vintage Tupperware containers she's had since the 70s. When she brings her surprise meatloaf that tastes like cardboard soaked in ketchup, I order meatloaf from the diner and carefully transfer it to her containers. I'm spending $200 a month just to maintain the charade. Things started unraveling two weeks ago when Mallory announced she was entering a cooking competition at the community center and wanted me to be her sous chef and taste tester. She's been coming over more frequently, sometimes unannounced, bringing practice dishes. Greg's been acting strange about it, too. Overly enthusiastic, constantly asking if I'm excited about spending more. I'm with his mother, watching me eat with this weird intensity. His eyes literally track every bite from fork to mouth, and he keeps asking, isn't it amazing? Don't you wish you could have this every day? My stomach Turns every time. Yesterday, he came home early and almost caught me transferring Thai food into Mallory's green bean casserole dish. I had to pretend I was just freshening up the presentation. My hands were shaking so badly, I nearly dropped the whole thing. He stood there for a full minute, just staring at me with a strange smile before saying, you really do love her cooking, don't you? But here's what's really odd. Greg's been having hushed phone conversations that end abruptly when I enter the room. Last week, I heard him say something about measuring the guest room and February move in date. When I asked about it, he said he was helping a coworker with furniture dimensions. He's also been weirdly insistent about us decluttering the spare bedroom, saying we need to make space. It's for new possibilities. Yesterday I found him in there with a tape measure and a notebook sketching what looked like furniture placement. When I walked in, he slammed the notebook shut and practically shoved me out, saying it was a surprise and I'd ruin everything if I kept snooping. Mallory's been dropping hints, too, asking about local doctors, the nearest grocery stores, whether our street gets loud quickly in winter. But if I ever tried to ask more questions, he'd shut me down instantly. Then one day, I woke up with food poisoning from this sketchy replacement Chinese food I had the day before and ran to the bathroom through the window. I saw Greg in the backyard on the phone, and his voice carry clearly in the morning. Quiet. Mom, I know you're excited about surprising her, but maybe we should tell her before my blood went cold. Tell me about what? He continued. I know I said February, but if you win this competition, it would be the perfect Celebration to announce your moving in. She loves your cooking so much. She'll be thrilled to have you here full time. Wait, moving in was my mother in law moving in, and my husband was just letting it happen? I stayed frozen, listening to him reassure his mother that I would definitely want her living with us, that I'm always saying how much I miss her between visits. The competition is tomorrow, and Mallory texted that she's bring

My coworker slides me $200 cash during lunch and whispers, I need you to be my boyfriend tomorrow. Just for four hours. It's my cousin's wedding. I almost choked on my sandwich. She's never talked to me about anything beyond spreadsheets and deadline complaints. Now she's offering me money to fake date her? She explains fast. Look, my whole family keeps asking why I'm still single. My mom calls every Sunday to remind me I'm 32 with no prospects. I just need someone normal to shut them up. Plus, you have that one good suit. The wedding's tomorrow at 2 p m. She promises another 200 after. You just have to hold my hand, laugh at my dad's jokes, and don't get too drunk. Easy money. Four hours of free food and pretending to like someone I already think is pretty cool. The cash would cover my car payment. Sure, why not? She looks relieved, like she was expecting me to say no, thank you. Seriously, you're saving my life here. Saturday morning, she picks me up in a BMW I didn't know she had. She's nervous, talking fast about the rules. We've been dating three months, met at work. That part's true. You love hiking. Because my mom will love that you went to State University. Don't mention your ex. Actually, don't mention any ex at all. She's gripping the steering wheel so tight, her knuckles Are white. Something's bothering her beyond normal. Fake date nerves. The venue is fancy. Way fancier than I expected. Valet parking, ice sculptures, a string quartet playing by the entrance. This isn't some backyard wedding. This is money. She grabs my hand really tight as we walk in, her palms sweating. Just stick close to me, okay? Some people here are complicated. We enter the cocktail area, and my chest tightens. I recognize faces in the crowd. This one guy by the bar is one of my ex's best friends, who always hosted those poker nights. This other guy is talking to someone near the fountain. He's my ex's friend from college who's always tagged with her in beach photos. Made me jealous every time. Then this girl walks by in a bridesmaid dress. She was my ex's roommate senior year. The one who told her I wasn't good enough. My stomach drops. These aren't random people. This is my ex's entire friend circle. Circle? Every person who watched our relationship explode. Hey, whose wedding is this exactly? I ask. She pulls me forward. My cousin Taylor's. Come on. Ceremony starting. Taylor. My ex's name is Taylor. We sit down in the fourth row. I'm scanning in the crowd, recognizing more faces. People who unfriended me after the breakup. I'm sweating through my good suit. Then the music starts. The wedding march. Everyone stands. The bride walks out. It's her. My ex. When I found in our bed with someone Else, two years ago. The one I was going to propose to. She's wearing the kind of dress she used to show me in magazines. My coworker squeezes my hand. You okay? You look pale. I can't speak. Can't move, can't breathe. Taylor looks beautiful, happy, glowing in a way she never did with me. The grooms, tall, everything. I'm not. After the ceremony, we're at cocktail hour. I'm Downing champagne like water, trying to stay calm. My coworker stays glued to my side, introducing me to aunts and uncles. This is my boyfriend. Three months now. He's wonderful playing the part, but dying inside. Then Taylor appears with the groom. Oh, my god, is that you? My coworker jumps in fast. Babe, you know the bride? Taylor's face cycles through emotions. Shock, confusion, something else. We. We dated years ago. Small world, my coworker says. Way too cheerful. We should get drinks sometime.

During a dinner celebrating us signing a lease on a brand new home, my wife dropped the bomb that she was quitting her job. I want to be a trad wife, she said out of the blue. I thought it was a joke until she pulled up her Instagram, where she had already made an extensive post about how amazing of a husband I was for agreeing to work two jobs to pay for the mortgage. The next morning, Katie quit her nursing job with no notice. By the end of the week, she'd gone full traditional. Wouldn't drive, wouldn't work, wouldn't make financial decisions. She also wouldn't answer the door for deliveries, claiming that was a man's job. So my expensive work equipment got stolen off our porch. she refused to sign for my certified mail from the IRS about a tax because traditional wives don't handle business matters. I got fined $8,000 for missing the deadline. Then my brother got into a severe car accident 40 minutes away. Single dad. His kids were at school and needed to be picked up. In two hours, he was unconscious and I was stuck in a mandatory meeting at work that I'd be fired for leaving. Katie, please, just this once, pick up the kids from school and drive them to the hospital. Traditional wives don't drive, she said, arranging flowers she picked from our garden. It's not feminine. They're 8 and 10 years old. They'll be standing outside school alone. Maybe their mother should have thought about that before divorcing your brother. My brother's kids waited outside their school until child services pick them up. The investigation lasted months. He nearly lost custody because of child abandonment while he was literally in a coma. I remember begging her to stop. She could be traditional and still use her frontal lobe, but nope, because two weeks later, our house caught fire. She was in the kitchen and left the stove on by accident. Extinguisher was literally in the corner next to her. But instead of grabbing it, she ran outside and called me. Traditional wives don't handle emergencies. That's the man's job. By the time firefighters arrived, half the kitchen was destroyed. 20,000 in damages. Insurance investigated why she didn't attempt to put out a containable fire, and our premiums tripled. That was when I finally snapped. You want traditional? Fine. She gleamed with excitement until I opened our banking app. I'm closing your access to our joint account. Her head snapped up. What? Traditional wives don't have their own bank accounts. They get allowances. My grandfather gave my grandmother $10 a week in 1960. Adjusted for inflation, that's $100 a month. That's insane. That's traditional. That evening, she was planning a Friday night out with the girls. Apparently, that's traditional. I'll need an Uber to downtown. Probably $30 each way. Traditional wives don't go to Bars without their husbands? That's inappropriate. It's just drinks with friends. My grandmother never went anywhere without my grandfather after six PM. Very traditional. She ended up canceling. Her father's 70th birthday was the next week, and her whole family had planned a surprise party for months. But when Saturday came, I had to work. I can't take you. I said, so you can't go. She had no car and missed it. Her father cried when he realized she wasn't coming. Her mother called her selfish. When Katie's grandmother was dying in hospice, Katie came to me crying, please, I need money for an Uber. Just this once. She's asking for me. Traditional wives don't handle money. I reminded her you said modern women's financial independence destroyed marriages. Remember your Instagram post? Her grandmother died a 30 minute drive away while Katie sat at home. Then her brother's wedding invitation arrived. Destination wedding in Mexico. Katie begged for her

I came into the emergency room clutching my abdomen. In the same hospital I once worked as chief of surgery. After two hours, I finally got to see Doctor Harm, who barely glanced up at me and sighed like I'd interrupted something by being here. Let me guess, he said before I could speak. You're 90 years old, ate dinner too late, and now you're panicking. On a scale of one to 10, how bad is your imaginary emergency? When I said eight, he actually laughed. Right. Everyone says eight. Real pain doesn't let you walk in here in your pajamas looking so put together. My pajamas were soaked with sweat from the pain. When did you last have your period? He asked with a smirk. When I said I was postmenopausal, he nodded like he'd solved everything. There you go. Hormones. They make women your age think every little cramp is a heart attack or appendicitis. You tried yoga? Maybe losing some weight? He typed something without examining me. I see a lot of hysterical women your age. Retirement gives you too much time to obsess over every little ache. I tried to explain that I knew my body, but he interrupted, ma'am, I have actual emergencies to deal with. Young man next door got stabbed. That's real medicine. Your psychosomatic belly ache can be handled by your GP on Monday. He started to leave, but I grabbed the rails of The bed, please. Something's wrong. I can feel it. He pried my fingers off one by one. This is drug seeking behavior. Are you here for pain pills? Because that's not happening. A nurse came in and harm told her loudly. Just anxiety. Probably wants attention. Her husband probably doesn't listen to her anymore, so she comes here for someone to talk to. He didn't know. My husband died two years ago in this very hospital. Don't waste resources on blood work. Give her some antacids and discharge papers. The nurse looked uncertain, but he snapped. Did I stutter, or do you want to be a doctor now, too? When I asked for a different doctor, he got nastier. You want a doctor shop? Classic drug seeking. I'm noting this in your file. He pulled up my chart on the computer. Oh, look, you've been here before. Frequent flyer. Lonely old women love the attention from young doctors. It's pathetic, but common. He didn't scroll down far enough to see my employment history at this hospital. The pain was getting worse and I doubled over, which made him roll his eyes dramatically. The performance isn't necessary. I've seen better acting from kindergarteners. He called another resident over. Watch this. Classic case of Munchausen's in the elderly. They Google symptoms and then pretend to have them. The president looked uncomfortable but stayed quiet. She probably lives alone. Kids don't visit, so she creates drama. I started describing my symptoms in medical Terms, hoping it would help. The pain is intermittent, positional with guarding in the upper quadrant. He cut me off. Oh, great. You watch Grey's anatomy and think you're a doctor now? Let me guess, you diagnose yourself on Webmd. He turned to the nurse. She's using medical words she doesn't understand. Probably reads medical forums all day. These board housewives always think they have whatever disease is trending on Facebook. When I stood up to leave and find another hospital, I collapsed from the pain. Instead of helping, he stood over me and said, this manipulation won't work. Get up. You're taking a bed from someone who actually needs it. He didn't help me up, just watched as I struggled. In my professional opinion, you need a psychiatrist, not an ER. Maybe some friends, hobby, anything besides wasting our time. He grabbed my arm roughly to pull me up, and I cried out, stop the theatrics! I'm documenting this as a psych case. You'll be lucky if insurance covers this visit when I'm done. He started dictating to his phone. Patient presents with fabricated symptoms, drug seeking behavior and hysteria typical of menopausal women seeking attention. He looked at me with disgust. Women like

My cousin Brianna sent out the most insane wedding invitation I've ever seen. Under the dress code, in bold letters, it said, no female guests. This includes family members, plus ones, and children. Male attendees only. I thought it was a typo until she called me personally. I know it seems harsh, she said, but I need my wedding day to be about me. Other women always steal attention. This is my solution. I tried reasoning with her. Brianna, your own mother can't come to your wedding. She'll understand. Besides, she always cries and makes everything about her emotions. Real reason came out after 20 minutes of talking. Brianna was convinced that her fiance, Jerome, would leave her for someone prettier. She'd caught him liking other women's photos online and decided the only solution was to eliminate all competition from her big day. The family was in uproar. Her mother sobbed for days. Her three sisters were devastated. Even Jerome's mother was banned. But Brianna wouldn't budge. She hired all male vendors. Male photographer, male caterers, male florist. She even found a male makeup artist to do her hair and makeup. Two weeks before the wedding, I got a call from Jerome's best man, Terrell. This is insane. He's. Jerome's trying to support her, but his mom is threatening to disown him. Can't you talk sense into her? I tried one more time. Brianna just said, either support my Decision or don't come to the reception. Yes, she was allowing women at the reception, just not the ceremony, because that made sense in her world. The day of the wedding arrived. I wasn't there, obviously, but Terrell live streamed it for the banned women in a group chat. The venue looked beautiful, but eerily empty. Thirty men sat awkwardly in a space meant for 200. No one knew where to look or what to say. Then came the professional. Brianna had no bridesmaids, so she walked alone. The music started, the doors opened, and in walked nobody. The music played for a full minute while everyone stared at the empty doorway. Jerome started sweating. The efficient looked confused. Terrell ran to check. He found Brianna in the bridal suite, locked in the bathroom, having a complete meltdown. Her male makeup artist had given her what she called drag queen makeup. Her hair was teased into a massive Buffon. She looked like she was competing in a pageant from 1987 without any women around to help fix it. She'd been trying to redo everything herself and made it worse. But that wasn't why she was really crying. Through the door. She admitted the truth. I've been so focused on keeping women away that I forgot this meant I'd have nobody to share this with. No mother daughter moment, no sisters helping with my dress. I'm completely alone on the most important day of my life. Jerome went to talk To her, we could hear him through Terrell's phone. Baby, this. It's crazy. You banned my mother? Your mother? What are we doing? I just didn't want you looking at other women, she sobbed. I'm looking at other women every day because you made this wedding into a circus! Everyone's talking about the bride who banned women, not the bride I'm marrying. You created the exact attention you were trying to avoid. She finally came out an hour later, makeup streaked, hair deflated. They did a quick ceremony with just the officiant, Jerome Terrell, and Brianna's father, who looked like he wanted to disappear here. The reception was even worse. All the band women showed up, but the atmosphere was ice cold. Brianna tried to act like nothing happened, but everyone knew. Her mother sat in the corner crying. Her sisters left after 15 minutes. Jerome's mother didn't even show up. The photographer, who'd only been hired for his gender, turned out to be terrible. Every photo was

We've been together two years. Last month, his college girlfriend Madison died from cancer at just 26. They'd broken up five years ago, but stayed friends on social media. I'd always felt a little weird about their friendship, but I trusted him completely. He was absolutely devastated when she passed. Took a week off work, barely ate anything. Just lay in bed scrolling through old photos of them together. I tried being supportive, making his favorite meals, bringing him tea, giving him space when he needed it. Then he started talking about her constantly. Madison always made the best lasagna from scratch with her grandmother's recipe. Madison would have absolutely loved this movie. She had such incredible taste in everything. Madison understood my twisted sense of humor better than anyone ever has or probably ever will. At first I thought it was completely normal grief. People reminisce about lost friends all the time, right? I figured he'd work through it naturally, but it escalated really quickly. He began comparing literally everything I did to Madison. When I cooked dinner, he'd mention how Madison's version was somehow better. When I laughed at his jokes, he'd say Madison's laugh was more genuine and musical. When I wore certain outfits, he comment that Madison had better style sense. It got really weird when he asked me to dye my hair blonde like Madison's had been. Said it would help him feel closer to those happy memories during this in readily difficult time in his life. I refused Point Blank. He got genuinely upset, accused me of being selfish and unsupportive during his grief. Said a truly loving girlfriend would understand what he was going through and try to help him heal properly. That hurt deeply, but I tried to stay patient. Everyone grieves differently, and I didn't want to be the terrible girlfriend who couldn't handle her boyfriend mourning a friend. Last week, I found him at two a m. Sitting at our kitchen table, writing intensely in a leather journal I'd never seen before, page after page about Madison. How she was his true soulmate and the only woman who truly understood his deepest soul. He wrote things like, I made the biggest mistake of my life letting her go, and I settled for someone lesser because I was terrified of real, assuming love. I was reading over his shoulder in the dark hallway when he finally noticed me standing there. He slammed the journal shut and got incredibly defensive. Said it was private therapy and I was serious, seriously violating his personal boundaries. The absolute final straw was yesterday evening. We're at dinner with his parents at their favorite Italian restaurant, when his mom casually mentions that Madison had sent her a lasagna recipe years ago. He immediately tears up and says, I'll never love anyone the way I loved her. She was absolutely Perfect in every single way imaginable. His dad looked completely horrified. His mom tried desperately changing the subject to the web.

And now that I'm rich, he demands that I give him our house and support him for the rest of his life. I was 15 when my parents died. No family ended up on the streets until a government program gave me housing and half minimum wage until 18. When that ended, I couldn't get work because I had no address. Finally got a job at a diner making almost nothing. That's where I met Cody, my now husband. He was a regular customer and we talked for hours. Six months later, I moved in with him. His dad hated me from day one. Called me worthless, said I'd drag his son down. I paid their rent, bills, groceries. Saved every penny for our future. Didn't matter. Daily insults, constant judgment. Street rat. He'd call me at dinner. My son deserves better than some homeless girl. Cody would defend me, but his dad would just laugh. She's using you, son. Mark my words. I worked doubles at the diner while Cody did construction. Every night I'd come home exhausted to more criticism. Still smell like grease. His dad would sneer, this is what failure looks like. The worst part? I genuinely tried to win him over. Cooked his favorite meals, cleaned the house spotless. Even bought him birthday gifts with money I could barely spare. Nothing worked. One Christmas. I saved for months to buy him a nice watch. He opened it, looked gusted, and said, I don't need charity from a charity case. Then he threw it in the trash right in front of me. Cody's friends would come over, and his dad would introduce me as the homeless girl Cody's wasting his time with. I'd sit there humiliated while everyone looked at me with pity. One night, we came home from a date, and he wouldn't let us in. Said he'd sold our clothes and stolen our savings. I won't support two losers who'll never succeed. We slept in my car that night. Cody cried. First time I'd ever seen him break down. I'm sorry, he kept saying. I should have stood up to him sooner. Got a tiny room near the diner. Cody found work. The room was so small, we had to take turns getting dressed. Ate a ramen for months, but we were finally free. We took a loan, opened our own small restaurant. After hours, Cody would cook while I waited tables. We'd work our day jobs, then run to our place until midnight. The first year was brutal. Barely breaking even, working 16 hour days, sleeping four hours a night. His dad would drive by sometimes just to laugh at us through the window. But slowly, customers started coming back. Word spread. Local food blogger gave us five stars. Lines started forming outside. We hired our first employee, a kid from The streets like me. Then another. Cody insisted we pay above minimum wage. Everyone deserves a real chance, he'd say. Years passed. That one restaurant became five, then 10. We built an empire. Cody proposed in our flagship restaurant. You turn my life around, he said. Let's make it official. His dad wasn't invited to the wedding. We had two kids, Sophia and Frederick. Cody turned into the most incredible father. I want to be everything my dad wasn't, he'd say while reading them bedtime stories. Our company went public three years ago. We're worth about 50 million now. Bought a mansion in the hills with a pool the kids love. Cody's mom visits sometimes. Divorced his dad years ago and finally admits he was always horrible.

But I went along with it and watched her and her lawyer embarrass themselves in front of the judge. We split custody fifty fifty when we divorced 3 years ago. Same salaries, same time with our 5 year old daughter, so no child support needed. That was the deal we both signed off on. But my ex got greedy. She quit her job to find herself enrolled in some online marketing course, then dropped out after two months when it got hard. Suddenly she's blowing up my phone demanding $200 monthly because I control my finances better than her. I laughed it off until her lawyer contacted me. Fine. I thought, let's play this game. Here's what she didn't know. I'm meticulous with records. Every receipt, every bank statement, every expense tracked to the penny. And color coded bed sheets. It's literally how I survived our messy divorce. Her lawyer filed the case without requesting my actual income. They just guessed based on my old job from two years ago and guessed wrong. They estimated I made 30% more than reality and had half my actual expenses. Basic mistake number one. Meanwhile, I'm gathering evidence like I'm building a criminal case. Stubs, rent receipts, grocery bills, medical co pays, our daughter's dance class fees, everything organized by date and category. As we approached court, my lawyer called with an update. Her attorney figured out She'd been lying about her financial situation and wanted to settle immediately. She doesn't want to go to court anymore, he said, barely containing his laughter. But my ex refused the settlement. She was convinced she'd win because judges always side with the mom. Court day arrives. Sitting there in my best suit, folder full of evidence, watching her strut in like she owns the place. The judge reviews both our financial statements side by side. I watch his expression change from neutral to confused to visibly annoyed. Plot twist after calculating everything properly, she actually had more disposable income than me. Way more. Her unemployment benefits, plus child tax credits, plus help from her new boyfriend, plus the side gig she forgot to mention. It all added up. The judge looked directly at her. Ma'am, you're asking him to pay support when you have $400 more per month than available income? Her lawyer literally face palmed and started shuffling papers like he was looking for an escape route. But it gets exponentially better. She'd submitted completely falsified bank statements as supporting evidence, claiming she only had $75 in total savings. The judge caught the deception immediately. Dates didn't match the statement periods, dollar amounts were clearly altered with correction fluid. The bank routing numbers were from a completely different financial institution. Ma'am, are you fully aware that knowingly submitting false evidence to this court constitutes perjury, which is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison? The Judge asked, his voice absolutely ice cold. My ex Heather went completely pale and start

So I got the perfect revenge. She crashed our cabin weekend claiming her Airbnb fell through. I knew it was BS the moment she showed up with a perfectly packed bag and a smug smile. My boyfriend Joseph felt bad for her and invited her to stay without even asking me. For three days straight, she kept creating these elaborate situations to make me look like the worst girlfriend ever. Like when she helped make dinner on Friday night. She volunteered to preheat the oven while I prepped ingredients. Everything seemed normal until I put our carefully marinated steaks in and they came out completely charred. She acted shocked when Joseph got mad at me for ruining our expensive dinner. Later, I noticed she'd secretly cranked the oven to 500 degrees. Saturday morning, she suggested we go hiking to this amazing waterfall she'd been to for. She gave me detailed directions to the trailhead while she rode with Joseph. Turns out she sent me to the wrong trail entirely. I spent two hours lost in the woods with no cell service while they bonded over waiting for me. When I finally found them at the actual trailhead, Joseph was visibly annoyed I'd kept them waiting. She just shrugged and said, oh, I guess I mixed up the directions. My bad. The manipulation got worse as the weekend went on. She kept doing this thing where she'd bring up inside jokes and memories from before I existed, making me. I feel like an outsider in my own relationship. Remember when we did this? And remember when we did that? Always with this little smile directed at me. She'd also accidentally brush against Joseph, constantly grab his arm when laughing, and find excuses to lean over him. During Saturday afternoon, we decided to go swimming in the lake. She conveniently forgot to pack a swimsuit and asked to borrow one of mine. The one she picked was my smallest bikini, and she made sure to comment loudly about how loose it was on her while adjusting it right in front of Joseph. Then she suggested we play volleyball in the water and kept accidentally bumping into me, making me lose my balance. The breaking point was Saturday night, we were all sitting by the fire when she pretended to be drunk and started crying about how much she missed the old days before I came along and changed everything. She was literally sobbing into Joseph's shoulder about how their friend group was never the same, how she felt like she was losing her best friend, and how things used to be so much. My boyfriend was actually comforting her, rubbing her back, and telling her nothing had changed between them. That's when I noticed something crucial. All weekend, she'd been taking tons of photos with Joseph's phone and hers, documenting every Moment. But I realized she was only capturing me when I looked terrible. Messy hair from hiking, unflattering angle while eating, caught mid chew, or when I was frustrated and arguing. Meanwhile, every single photo of her was perfectly posed and filtered. So while she was in the bathroom touching up her makeup for the 10th time that day, I grabbed her phone. She'd left it unlocked on the counter next to the sink. I scrolled through her camera roll and found the absolute worst photo she'd taken all weekend of herself. Double chin, eyes half closed, food stuck in her teeth, hair a complete disaster. It was from when she was laughing too hard at one of Joseph's jokes and snorting. I posted it to her Instagram story.

The speed that you're traveling, by the time you actually hit the water, it will be the same as if you were hitting concrete. This is called surface tension. Purpose tension is the reason why Olympic swimming pools have little sprinklers shooting into the water. It rattles up the water a little bit, allowing the divers to enter the water like this instead of like this. And I don't know about you, but regardless of how much I know about surface tension, it still seems like if my parachute malfunctions, I should still aim for the water. But no. Surface tension. Science, blah blah blah. However, regardless of how annoying surface tension is, without it, our lives would be miserable. How so? Let me explain. Imagine you're walking through your apartment with a glass of water. You trip and fall and spill the glass of water on the floor, creating a puddle. Surface tension is the reason why the puddle of water is only this big and not this big covering every surface area of ground on your apartment floor. Literally without surface tension, if you spilled a glass of water on the floor, it would travel all over the floor about two microns deep. Meaning every time you spilled water, it would literally be impossible to clean all of it up.

I was eating breakfast when my mom walked up and slapped a cereal bowl right out of my hands. The bowl shattered on the floor, milk spraying everywhere. Stop! Stop stealing our food, you mosquito! She screamed. From now on, you buy your own groceries or you don't eat, period! I stared at her, shocked and covered in cold milk and Lucky Charms. For years, I've been using my employee discount at grocery stores and paying for most of it with my own cash. I didn't think I'd ever need to tell them, but now, all of a sudden, I'm a parasite, a freeloader. I kept my mouth shut, cleaned up the mess in silence. Then I went out, bought a few groceries for myself, kept every receipt and and labeled everything with my name. My parents smirked at each other over dinner that night, confident they'd finally save money without their thief bleeding them dry. When we went out to buy groceries, my parents acted arrogant, throwing expensive brands into the cart without looking at the price tags. Perrier sparkling water, truffle oil, Tide Pods. They made it to the cashier and saw the huge 400 dollar price. Their smiles completely disappeared. This place is price gouging! My dad yelled when he got home. It never cost this much before, but it did. It's just they never actually done the shopping themselves. Even at other stores, they ended Up buying pre cut fruit for $30 when whole fruit was $5. Someone convinced them to buy organic water for $40. Falling for the classic it's keep you feeling young and take away all the back pain. They missed out on Tuesday senior discounts, missed every buy one get one sale, threw out receipts with 50 dollar off coupons on the back, and bought things that wouldn't even work with our electric stove. By the end of the month, my parents had spent $2,500 on groceries just for the two of them. Half of them rotting away because they didn't know what.

I froze with my sandwich halfway to my mouth. What video? The entire table went silent. Six pairs of eyes suddenly finding their lunch trays. Fascinating. Gwen's cheeks flushed red as she stammered. I thought you knew. Never mind, it's nothing. But it wasn't nothing. Behind me, I heard muffled laughter and some when whisper my last name followed by more snickering. Gwen, what video? I pressed. My voice rising slightly. She shook her head vigorously, gathering her things with shaking hands. I shouldn't have said anything. Maybe you should go home. I saw a group of juniors behind us pointing their cameras at me and laughing and my heart sank. Whatever this video was, it had to be serious enough for so many people to laugh at me and for my best friend to look nervous. I immediately pulled out my phone and tried to call my parents, but my battery was dead. That's when the bell rang, leaving me no choice but to return to class. Walking into class was like walking into a circus. The second I stepped through the door, the entire room erupted. Not just giggles or whispers, full uncontrollable laughter. Someone in the back row was making this weird motion with their arms like something falling or tumbling down. And the kids around him were practically crying from laughing so hard. Yo, she's actually here. Someone and shouted and more laughter exploded. I stood frozen in the doorway, my face burning. What the hell was so funny? What was in that video? The teacher looked up from his desk and the look on his face made my stomach drop. It wasn't anger at the disruption, but rather pity. Pure, unmistakable pity, like the way people look at you at a funeral. He spoke softly. Walk.

My three older brothers called it babysitting when I moved in with our grandmother after her kidneys failed two years ago. They drop by monthly to pat themselves on the back for letting me live rent free while I supposedly watch T V. All day. During visits, they'd explain dialysis like I was five, even though I've been running her home treatments myself for 18 months. They ambushed me last summer as all three showed up with nursing home pamphlets and a social worker they'd already hired. They gathered in Grandma's living room while she's that. Looking pale from the treatment I just finished, my oldest brother cleared his throat and launched into what was clearly a rehearsed speech. We all need to accept that grandma requires professional care now, and you need to stop hiding from real life and get an actual job. The social worker nodded along, while my middle brother explained that kidney failure required actual medical knowledge, not just good intentions. Playing nurse and driving her to the dialysis center three times a week isn't a lifeline, my youngest brother added while sorting through brochures. Medicare covers places where real nurses monitor patients instead of playing video games and hoping nothing goes wrong. I tried to explain what I actually did, but he cut me off. We see the insurance claims for Monday, Wednesday, Friday treatments, he said slowly, like I might not understand. She needs Round the clock medical care, not just someone making SAM, which is. And tucking her in at night. They didn't know the spare bedroom had become a sterile medical suite where I performed her dialysis myself every morning at 5. I calculated fluid removal rates based on ankle swelling only. I could read the insurance statements. They've been seen and clearly said home hemodialysis. But they assumed it was a billing code for the center since they couldn't imagine I was actually doing it myself. The machine runs itself anyway. My oldest brother told the social worker, you just connect tubes and watch Netflix for four hours. The social worker started explaining admission procedures. When grandma's breathing changed in that specific way, that meant she had

So I made his life a living hell. We moved into our house three years ago, and everything was perfect until Logan moved in next door six months later. He's maybe 35, works from home doing something with cryptocurrency, and has way too much time to monitor everyone else's business. He installed security cameras pointing directly at our property line. Then he put up those ridiculous private property, no trespassing signs every five feet along his fence. The guy even painted his grass with some kind of spray to make it look more green, which was weird, but whatever. My daughter Zoe plays in our backyard all the time. She's eight, loves soccer, and kicks the ball around for hours. Our yards are separated by one of those low, decorative fences, maybe two feet high. And sometimes her ball goes over like any normal kid. She'd hop over, grab it, and hop back. Takes literally 10 seconds. Last Tuesday, Zoe was playing when her ball went over Logan's fence. She hopped over to get it, and I watched from the kitchen window as Logan came storming out of his house. He started screaming at her. I could hear him yelling about property rights and respect for boundaries at an eight year old. I ran outside and told Logan to back off Zoe. He was crying and ran inside. I explained that kids sometimes chase balls. It's not a big deal, and Asked him to not yell at my daughter. Logan got up in my face and said, your little brat needs to learn boundaries. This is my property, and I don't want her stepping foot on it ever again. I told him she was just getting her ball and would be more careful, but he wasn't having it. Then yesterday came, so he was playing again when her ball went over. She looked at me through the window, and I nodded. It's a ball, for crying out loud. She hopped over, grabbed it, and started hopping back. That's when Logan appeared with his phone already dialing. I couldn't believe it. I ran outside as Zoe came back, confused and scared because this grown man was on the phone with the police about her. 20 minutes later, a police car pulled up. The officer got out, looking like he'd rather be literal.

But she's been buried for 11 years. The humming started three weeks ago. I woke up at exactly 4:00am to the sound of my mother's favorite lullaby. Drifting up from the kitchen, half asleep, I almost called out to her before remembering she'd been dead for 11 years. The first night, I convinced myself it was a dream. The second night, I noticed the time again, 4:00am. The third night, same thing. Always that same lullaby she used to hum while making breakfast. Always from the kitchen, always at 4:19. On the fourth night, I set my phone to record. At 4:19, the humming began. When I played it back the next morning, my blood went cold. There it was, faint but unmistakable. My mother's voice humming you are my Sunshine. I still had an old voicemail from her saved on my phone from two weeks before she died. She'd called to remind me about dinner plans, and at the end, she'd hummed a few bars while looking for her keys. I compared the recordings. The pitch, the rhythm, the slight rasp she developed from years of smoking. Identical. That morning, I found things moved in the kitchen. Kettle was on the stove instead of the counter where I always left it. A spoon lay next to the sink, still wet. One chair was pulled out from the table at her usual spot. I started sleeping downstairs on The couch, to be closer to the kitchen. Every night at 4:19, the humming would begin. Sometimes it lasted 30 seconds, sometimes five minutes. I'd lie there paralyzed, unable to move, just listening to my dead mother's voice filling the darkness. After a week of this, I drove to Riverside Cemetery. Mom's grave looked normal at first, but when I knelt down, I noticed the grass seemed looser than the surrounding plots. The dirt beneath looked recently disturbed, like something had pushed up from below and been hastily covered. I called the cemetery office. They had no record of any maintenance on that plot that night. I decided to wait in the kitchen. I set up my phone on the counter to record and sat at the table in complete darkness. At 4:18, I watched the clock on the microwave, my heart pounding. 4:19. The humming started immediately. But this time it was different. It wasn't coming from some vague direction. It was right behind me. My mother's voice, clear as if she was standing over my shoulder, humming our song. I couldn't move, every muscle locked in terror.

Real pain doesn't let you walk in here in your pajamas looking so put together. My pajamas were soaked with sweat from the pain. When did you last have your period? He asked with a smirk. When I said I was postmenopausal, he nodded like he'd solved everything. There you go. Hormones. They make women your age think every little cramp is a heart attack or appendicitis. Have you tried yoga? Maybe losing some weight? He typed something without examining me. I see a lot of hysterical women your age. Retirement gives you too much time to obsess over every little ache. I tried to explain that I knew my body, but he interrupted, ma'am, I have actual emergencies to deal with. Young man next door got stabbed. That's real medicine. Your psychosomatic belly ache can be handled by your GP on Monday. He started to leave, but I grabbed the rails. Of the bed, please. Something's wrong. I can feel it. He pried my fingers off one by one. This is drug seeking behavior. Are you here for pain pills? Because that's not happening. A nurse came in and harm told her loudly. Just anxiety. Probably wants attention. Her husband probably doesn't listen to her anymore, so she comes here for someone to talk to. He didn't know. My husband died two years ago in this very hospital. Don't waste resources on blood work. Give her some antacids and discharge papers. The nurse looked uncertain, but he snapped. Did I stutter, or do you want to be a doctor now, too? When I asked for a different doctor, he got nastier. You want a doctor shop? Classic drug seeking. I'm noting this in your file. He pulled up my chart on the computer. Oh, look, you've been here before.

I was sitting in Mister Kelton's history class. Just another boring Tuesday afternoon. We were learning about World War 2 when the intercom crackled to life. Lockdown! This is not a drill. Everyone froze, like, dead silent. The kind of quiet that makes your ears ring. Mister Kelton, who was the substitute we'd never seen before, went completely white. His hands started shaking as he grabbed the door handle. Everyone under your desks, now! His voice was different. Serious in a way that made my stomach drop. Most of us had done lockdown drills before. You hide, stay quiet. Wait for the all clear. But Mister Kelton wasn't following the script. He started dragging desks across the room, shoving them against the door like his life depended on it. The scraping sound was so loud, I was sure whoever was out there would hear us. Sir, you're supposed to just lock the door, whispered Jessica from under her desk. Ignored her completely. Next thing I know, he's reaching up and unscrewing the light bulbs with his bare hands. The classroom went dim. Just emergency lighting from the hallway. Creeping under the door. Light gives away position, he muttered to himself, like he was talking to someone we couldn't see. Then he took off his belt, not to hit anyone, but to wrap it around the door handle and tie it to something. His hands moved like he'd done this a thousand times before. Fast, precise. No wasted motion. My friend Tyler's phone buzzed once. Mr. Kelton spun around so fast, I thought he was gonna fall over. Phone. Give it to me now. Tyler looked confused, but, sir, it might be my mom checking if I'm okay. Sound gives you away. Silence is survival. He snatched the phone and powered it off. Anyone else? We all shook our heads real quick. Good. Now shoes off, all of you. What? That was Emma sitting two rows over. Shoes off. Footsteps travel through floors. They can track movement. This was getting weird, but something about the

My 1 0 year old daughter, Lily kept tattling on her younger brother constantly. Every five minutes it was Mom, Tommy touched my stuff! Or Mom, Tommy looked at me weird or Mom, Tommy breathed too loud during my show. I was losing my mind with the constant interruptions throughout every single day. The breaking point came during an important work call when Lily burst into my office screaming that Tommy had walked past her bedroom door without asking permission. Mission first. My boss and three clients heard the entire meltdown through my unmuted microphone. I was absolutely mortified and knew something had to change, so I implemented a tattling tax system. Every time she tattle on Tommy for something minor or petty, she owed me 25 cents from her weekly allowance money. Only real emergencies were free, like if someone was actually hurt, breaking something valuable, or doing something genuinely dangerous that required intervention. I spent an entire evening explaining the system carefully to both kids, creating specific examples of what counted as tattling versus legitimate concerns that needed my attention. Lily seemed to understand the rules perfectly and even nodded enthusiastically when I said this would help her think before complaining. Tommy just looked absolutely relieved that his sister might finally leave him alone. Battling stopped immediately and completely. For two absolutely blissful weeks, our house was perfectly quiet. No constant complaints echoing through every room. No sibling drama. Interrupting my work calls or peaceful evenings. I could actually focus on important tasks without being summoned every few minutes to referee microscopic disputes. Tommy seemed genuinely happier during this peaceful period, playing freely in common areas without his sister monitoring his every single move like a tiny surveillance officer. He started laughing more often, running around

My nine year old daughter came home crying because her science teacher told her she was lying about her dad being an astronaut. My daughter, Sarah had always been proud that I worked for NASA. Every show and tell, she'd bring my old space gloves or mission patches. Classmates loved hearing stories about how astronauts eat and sleep in space. But then Mrs. Thompson joined the school as the new science teacher. During a lesson about space, Sarah raised her hand and shared how I had been on three missions to the International Space Station. Missus Thompson stopped the lesson and called her a liar in front of everyone. Your father can't be an astronaut, she said. NASA doesn't have any active missions right now. They stopped sending people to space years ago. Sarah tried to explain that I worked with both NASA and Space X, but Missus Thompson cut her off. Then next day, Missus Thompson made Sarah stand in front of the class and apologize for making up stories. She even sent Sarah to the principal's office for spreading lies. When my daughter started crying and insisted she was telling the truth, Sarah came home devastated. He showed me the F grade. Missus Thompson gave her space project with a note saying, stop making up stories about NASA. My daughter had spent weeks on that project using real photos from my missions and actual NASA Data I was furious. I emailed Missus Thompson explaining who I was and attached my NASA credentials. She replied saying those could easily be faked, and threatened to report me for encouraging my daughter to lie.

He even knew I always bought strawberry Pop Tarts from the vending machine after class. Your dad sent me to get you to the hospital, he said, showing me his phone with what looks like a text from Dad's number. My hands were shaking, but I got in his beat up Honda Civic. He didn't drive toward the hospital. Instead, he got on Highway 52, going the opposite direction. When I asked where we were going, he pressed the door locks and said, change of plans, kiddo. I watched him throw my backpack out the window about 10 minutes later, including my phone. My stomach dropped when I realized what was happening. We drove for two hours. He kept the radio on some country station and occasionally offered me beef jerky from a bag on his dashboard. He wasn't mean or scary like the kidnapper movies I'd seen. He just seemed lonely and kept talking about how his daughter would have been my age if she hadn't moved away with his ex wife. Finally, he stopped at a shell station near some tiny town I'd never heard of. Bathroom break, he said, walking me inside while keeping his hand on my shoulder. The women's restroom was small and dingy. The Broken mirror and a trash can overflowing with paper towels. That's when I saw it. Taped to the back of the door was this faded poster about human trafficking. At the bottom it said, if. If you're in danger, leave a note where someone will find it. I didn't have paper, but in my jacket pocket was the receipt from the art supply store where I bought paint brushes earlier. Using a stubby pencil from the same pocket, I wrote, help kidnapped in gray Honda. Please call police. I folded it tight and dropped it behind the trash bin.

Julia seemed happy, too, but there was something off about her energy. She kept checking her phone and seemed jumpy whenever Mark got too loud with his celebrating. The delivery went smooth. Healthy baby boy. Everything normal. Mark's crying happy tears. Julia's exhausted but smiling. And I'm thinking, this is one of those perfect family moments you live for in this job. Mark immediately starts calling the baby my little champion won't stop talking about how he's gonna teach him to play baseball and fix cars. So here's where it gets messy. We do routine blood work on all newborns. Standard stuff. When the results came back, I had to double check them because something didn't add up. The baby had a B blood type. Mark was type O. Julia was type A. Now, I. I'm not a genetics expert, but I know enough to know this was basically impossible. Type O and type A parents can't have an A B baby. I rechecked Mark's records from his previous visits. Definitely type O. Confirmed multiple times. I even had the lab run the baby's blood again. Same result. My stomach started doing flips because I knew what this Meant, but I hoped maybe there was some mix up. When I handed Julia the standard paperwork that included the blood work results, her face went completely white. Like, scary white. She. I grabbed the paper, crumpled it up real quick, and shoved it in her purse. Then she grabbed my arm and whispered, please don't tell Mark about this. The desperation in her voice was intense. I had to keep working, but I couldn't stop thinking about it.

He was with a girl who couldn't have been older than 16. She wore an oversized hoodie with the hood pulled up, sleeves covering her hands completely. Something about her posture made my stomach twist. Evening, the man said cheerfully, grabbing a bag of chips and a Mountain Dew from the cooler. Beautiful night, isn't it? The girl stayed silent beside him, staring at the floor. Her shoulders were hunched inward, like she was trying to disappear. When he called her sweetie and told her to grab some candy, it sounded wrong, too forced, too careful. I rang up their items, keeping my expression neutral while my brain screamed that something was off. The girl's face was pale, almost gray, dark circles under her eyes. She looked exhausted in a way that went deeper than just being tired. That'll be 7:50, I said, extending the receipt toward the man. He reached for it, but the girl stepped forward. Can I have it? She asked quietly. Her voice was barely above a whisper. The man's jaw tightened for just a second before his smile returned. Of course, honey. As I handed her the receipt, she pulled back her sleeve slightly. That's when I saw it. Her hand was positioned strangely, fingers curled, thumb tucked underneath. Then quick, As lightning, she closed her fingers over her thumb in a subtle motion. My heart stopped. I'd seen that exact gesture on TikTok months ago, the silent signal for help, the one that was supposed to save lives. I kept my face blank, nodding as if nothing happened. Have a good night, I managed to say. The man hurried her toward the door, his hand on her lower back, guiding her movements through the window.

Sometimes my hands would tremble slightly when writing. Nothing dramatic, just enough to make me wonder. Grandmother had died from early onset alzheimer's when she was just 48. My mother at 52. I was 19 when I watched my mom forget my name for the first time. The geneticist told me I had a 50% chance of carrying the same gene mutation. I take a test and know for certain. But I refused. What was the point of knowing my expiration date? So I lived in fear. Every forgotten appointment or misplaced key became evidence of my inevitable decline. I stopped dating entirely. I'd seen what this disease does to partners. I abandoned my law school dreams. Instead, I took a mindless job where mistakes wouldn't matter. I lived frugally, saving for care I'd need someday. My friends drifted away as I didn't go anywhere and didn't try to live a life. By 30, I was essentially just waiting to die. Then came the day I knocked over my beer with food, and something in me just broke. I lost it, screamed at myself and just kept screaming. My neighbor heard and called 9 1 1. The knock came.

She told the officer she forgot I was there because she had errands to run, like I was a grocery bag she left behind. The cop looked at her weird and asked how you forget your kid. Mom just shrugged and said, kids are supposed to stay where you put them. That wasn't even the worst part. Two weeks later, she did it again at the mall. This time I waited four hours until mall security found me asleep on a food court chair. When mom finally came back, she was carrying shopping bags from stores that weren't even in that mall.

My older sister London was always the pretty one because she hit puberty first and got the good genes.

Paris, you're too young for expensive products, London said, examining her perfect complexion in the mirror. Maybe when you learn to wash your face properly. My skin was basically a minefield of cystic acne, blackheads, and scars from picking. London skin glowed like she had a filter on in real life. She made me wait outside the bathroom every morning while she did her 45 minute skincare routine, straightening already perfect hair while I stood there with toothpaste dripping down my chin. When guys came over to study, she'd parade rue in her cutest outfits, telling them about my pizza face and how I used to eat glue in kindergarten. Natural beauty can't be bought, she'd tell her parents when I complained about needing dermatology appointments. Paris needs to learn that personality matters more than looks. The worst part? She'd leave her expensive products all over the bathroom, half used bottles of retinol and vitamin C serum she'd abandoned for the next trending thing. But somehow I was the one wasting money. London loved reminding me how I'd never get asked to prom. You'll probably die a virgin, she'd laugh. Some of us are just meant to be beautiful. High School ended, London went straight to working at the mall because she wanted to get to discovered as a model. Translation she thought her looks would carry her through life. She spent every paycheck on tanning packages and highlights, living for the weekend parties. I went to community college, worked at a pharmacy where I Learned about ingredients. Saved every penny for a dermatologist. London would Snapchat me from clubs while I was studying. Why are you wasting your Friday night? She'd text. Oh, wait. Not like anyone's asking you out anyway. I'm investing in my future. I'd respond, you're just jealous you can't get into the VIP section. After two years, I

He Said I was putting his daughter's life at risk because I refused to follow simple instructions. Then Amanda got involved and tried to drag me to court to make it part of our custody agreement. The judge basically laughed them out of the courtroom. She told them they had zero right to dictate what I feed my kids in my own home. Craig wasn't even legally related to my boys.

Last night I realized it's a real murder that happens tomorrow. And he's the killer. For three years, every single night, my eight year old son, Ethan has insisted on the exact same bedtime story. Not from a book. He wants me to tell it from memory. If I change even one word, he screams until I start over. Tell me about the red door house, he always says. So I tell him. Once there was a yellow house with a red door at 47 Maple street. Inside lived Mrs. Carpenter, who made cookies every Sunday. She had three cats, muffin, buttons and snowball. One night, a little boy knocked on her red door exactly seven times. The story continues the same way. Every time. The boy asks for water, Mrs. Carpenter lets him in. He goes to her kitchen, takes a knife from the third drawer, and does something I always describe vaguely as a bad thing that made Mrs. Carpenter go to sleep forever. Then he leaves through the back door, counts to 100, and goes home. I thought I made it up. Some half asleep nonsense I created three years ago when Ethan wouldn't stop crying. But he latched onto it, demanding it word for word every night. Last night, after I finished the story, Ethan asked something new. Daddy, is 47 Maple street far from here? There is no 47 Maple street. But it's Just a story. Yes, there is. I looked it up on your phone. It's only six blocks away. My blood went cold. I grabbed my phone and searched. He was right. 47 Maple street existed six blocks from our house. A yellow house with a red door, according to the real estate listing owner, Dorothy Carpenter. I stayed up all night researching. Dorothy Carpenter was 73, lived alone, had three cats. According to her Facebook, the cat. Cats names made me drop my phone. Muffin buttons and snowball. This morning, I drove past her house. Yellow with a red door, exactly as I've been describing for three years. But I've never seen it before. We moved here only three years ago, and I never go that route. I called in sick to work and spent the day trying to rationalize this. Maybe I'd seen it subconsciously. Maybe Ethan had heard about it somewhere. But then I found something that destroyed any rational explanation. In my closet, buried in a box of old papers, I found a journal. I didn't remember keeping my handwriting, but I had no memory of writing it. The first entry was dated four years ago.

Every boyfriend who wants to keep dating my daughter has to pass a little test. I laughed nervously. What kind of test? Nothing too crazy, he said with a smile that didn't reach his eyes. Just proves you're serious about her. My girlfriend looked uncomfortable but didn't say anything. Her mom kept clearing dishes like nothing was happening. I figured it would be some harmless dad joke or maybe answering relationship questions. Her dad disappeared into the kitchen and came back with a small glass filled with dark liquid. He set it in front of me with Ceremony. Family hot sauce, he explained. Made it myself with special ingredients. Every boyfriend drinks a shot to join the Family. The smell hit me immediately. It was like someone had liquefied pure fire and mixed it with vinegar. My eyes started watering just from being near it. Dad. My girlfriend started, but he held up his hand. Tradition is tradition. Unless he's too weak to handle a little spice. I looked around the table. Everyone was watching me like this was completely normal. I picked up the glass and took the shot. The pain was instant and overwhelming. My mouth felt like it was melting. Tears streamed down my face as I tried not to show how much it hurt. But I made it through. Good. Her dad nodded. But that was just the first test.

Her apartment was tiny, one bedroom with yard sale furniture. She worked part time at a coffee shop and talked about saving money for rent. I felt bad because I made more than her, but she insisted on paying her own way. She never mentioned family much. They lived across the country and she didn't see them often. When I asked about holidays, she changed the subject. Then one day she got this phone call that changed everything. We were watching movies when her phone rang. She looked at the caller ID and went completely white. I have to take this, she said, walking into the bathroom. I could hear her talking through the door. Something about lawyers and dad. I already told you I don't want any part of this. When she came out, she looked really upset. Everything okay? I asked. Was quiet for a long time. Finally she said, my family situation is complicated. There's stuff I haven't told you. My dad wants me to come home for this business thing. He says it's important and I can't keep avoiding it.

She seemed nervous. Kept saying they were different and I shouldn't judge her. We flew first class, which seemed weird because she always acted like money was tight when I mentioned it.

By 9, I could forge their signatures perfectly and knew exactly how to calm her meltdowns. By 16, I scheduled her doctor visits and set alarms to give her medicine on time. Eve would fall asleep by the front door waiting for them to come home, rocking with her weighted blanket. And I'd carry her to bed at midnight, whispering that I'd always be there, even if they weren't. So when Stanford accepted me, I stared at the letter, knowing I couldn't leave her alone for two more years of high school. She caught me crying and grabbed my shoulders. You have to go. I don't like when you're sad, she said, rocking slightly. Parents suddenly appeared when they heard Stanford's name, actually proud for once and lecturing me about opportunities I couldn't pass up. But I told them I couldn't leave Eve alone, not when she needed someone who understood her routines and could advocate for her at school. For the first time in years, they actually look at me, and I watched something break in Mom's face. Oh, god, she whispered. You've been doing our job since second grade. All this time working to afford the best life for you two, and we haven't even been here to live it with you. Dad couldn't look at me when he finally spoke. Starting tomorrow, being here comes first. And for three beautiful months, they became the best parents. Dad Learned Eve's morning routine, mom attended parent teacher conferences, and they both showed up to her sophomore year orientation. Eve called me at Stanford listing every dinner detail they used. The smooth plates. Dad didn't mix her foods. Mom turned the TV volume to 16, not 17. They and photos of themselves at her art showcase. And Eve's smile in those pictures made the homesickness worth it. She even called one night. Very serious. I have a boyfriend, mom, and dad like him. He helps me at school. I felt grateful hearing her sound happy about normal teenage things.

Paris, you're too young for expensive products, London said, examining her perfect complexion in the mirror. Maybe when you learn to wash your face properly. My skin was basically a minefield of cystic acne, blackheads, and scars from picking. London skin glowed like she had a filter on in real life. She made me wait outside the bathroom every morning while she did her 45 minute skincare routine, straightening already perfect hair while I stood there with toothpaste dripping down my chin. When guys came over to study, she'd parade rue in her cutest outfits, telling them about my pizza face and how I used to eat glue in kindergarten. Natural beauty can't be bought, she'd tell her parents when I complained about needing dermatology appointment. Paris needs to learn that personality matters more than looks. The worst part? She'd leave her expensive products all over the bathroom. Half used bottles of retinol and vitamin C serums. She'd abandon then for the next trending thing. But somehow I was the one wasting money. London loved reminding me how I'd never get asked to prom. You'll probably die a virgin, she'd laugh. Some of us are just meant to be beautiful, High school ended, London went straight to working at the mall because she wanted to get to discovered as a model. Translation she thought her looks would carry her through life. She spent every paycheck on tanning packages and highlights, living for the weekend parties. I went to community college, worked at a pharmacy where I Learned about ingredients. Saved every penny for a dermatologist. London would Snapchat me from clubs while I was studying chemistry. Why are you wasting your Friday night? She. Oh, wait. Not like anyone's asking you out anyway. I'm investing in my future. I'd respond, you're just jealous you can't get into the VIP section. After two years, I transferred to state.

My parents got married because mom was pregnant. They stayed together for 18 years just to make each other miserable. And me? I was their favourite weapon. They never shared a bed. Dad slept on the couch from day one. Mom took the bedroom. I got a mattress on the floor of the walk in closet. They said a crib wouldn't fit anywhere else. Closet smelled like Mom's perfume and Dad's Cologne. Everything in our house had an owner. Mom's T V, Dad's coffee maker, Mom's milk, Dad's bread. They labeled everything with a label maker. The leftovers, the salt, even the ice cubes. I found labels on things you wouldn't believe. Mom's toilet paper, Dad's light bulbs. I ate cereal with water because Mom's milk was off limits and dad didn't buy any. I Learned to like black coffee at age 7 because the creamer was Mom's. I lost 12 pounds in fourth grade. The school nurse called home. They both showed up and blamed each other for starving me. Dinner would be silent. We'd sit at the same table, but they'd cook separate meals. Mom made pasta, dad made sandwiches. They'd eat at the same time, stare straight ahead. If I wanted food, I had to ask both. Usually got told no by both. Ask your mother, ask your father. Circle of rejection. Birthdays were weapons. Mom would throw a party and not tell dad. He'd Come home to strangers in the house. Next year, dad would take me to Chuck E. Cheese without telling mom. She'd call the cops reporting a kidnapping. The cops knew our address by heart. Officer Desanto brought my 10th birthday present. A journal. You're gonna need therapy, he said. I stopped wanting birthdays by age 10. Then they started communicating through me. Tell your mother I paid the water Bill. Tell your father he's three days late. I was 11 years old, delivering divorce threats across the dinner table. By 12, I was writing their hate messages down because they wanted documentation. I have three notebooks full of their messages to each other through me. When I was 13, mom started dating. She'd bring men home while dad was in the house.

When I was 12, my mom married Richard, a pediatric surgeon who seemed perfect on paper. He moved us into his massive house, bought me the latest iPhone, and always bragged about having a stepson. I remember thinking how lucky I was, especially when he take me to his hospital and let me shadow him while he worked with kids. But everything changed when my little brother Tommy was born. Richard became obsessed with making Tommy a medical prodigy. He'd force him to study anatomy flashcards instead of playing with toys. By age 4, Tommy could name every bone in the human body. But he'd never been to a playground. I started noticing bruises on Tommy's arms. When I asked, Richard said they were for surgery. He'd make Tommy practice sutures on oranges for hours, squeezing his wrist until it bruised if his stitches weren't perfect. My mom worked night shifts as a nurse, so she rarely saw what happened. When I told her, Richard convinced her I was jealous of Tommy's special education. He even showed her videos of Tommy perfectly reciting medical terms, saying, see? He loves learning. One night, I heard Tommy crying in the study. I found Richard forcing him to memorize surgical procedures, clapping his face each time he made a mistake. Tommy was shaking, holding an ice pack to his cheek. That's when I started recording everything on my phone. For three months, I gathered evidence videos of Richard screaming at Tommy for mispronouncing medical terms, photos of bruises, audio of Tommy begging not to do more training. I even caught Richard threatening to break Tommy's fingers if he didn't complete his practice sutures. The worst was when Tommy got a B+ on his kindergarten science test. Richard locked him in the basement medical lab for hours, making him practice procedures on

Last night I realized it's a real murder that happens tomorrow. And he's the killer. For three years, every single night, my eight year old son, Ethan has insisted on the exact same bedtime story. Not from a book. He wants me to tell it from memory. If I change even one word, he screams until I start over. Tell me about the red door house, he always says. So I tell him. Once there was a yellow house with a red door at 47 Maple street. Inside lived Mrs. Carpenter, who made cookies every Sunday. She had three cats, muffin, buttons and snowball. One night, a little boy knocked on her red door exactly seven times. The story continues the same way. Every time. The boy asks for water, Mrs. Carpenter lets him in. He goes to her kitchen, takes a knife from the third drawer, and does something I always describe vaguely as a bad thing that made Mrs. Carpenter go to sleep forever. Then he leaves through the back door, counts to 100, and goes home. I thought I made it up. Some half asleep nonsense I created three years ago when Ethan wouldn't stop crying. But he latched onto it, demanding it word for word every night. Last night, after I finished the story, Ethan asked something new. Daddy, is 47 Maple street far from here? There is no 47 Maple street. But it's Just a story. Yes, there is. I looked it up on your phone. It's only six blocks away. My blood went cold. I grabbed my phone and searched. He was right. 47 Maple street existed six blocks from our house. A yellow house with a red door, according to the real estate listing owner, Dorothy Carpenter. I stayed up all night researching. Dorothy Carpenter was 73, lived alone, had three cats. According to her Facebook, the cat. Cats names made me drop my phone. Muffin buttons and snowball. This morning, I drove past her house. Yellow with a red door, exactly as I've been describing for three years. But I've never seen it before. We moved here only three years ago, and I never go that route. I called in sick to work and spent the day trying to rationalize this. Maybe I'd seen it subconsciously. Maybe Ethan had heard about it somewhere.

She had perfect white teeth and that practiced airline smile. Welcome aboard, sir. Seat 14A. Right down the aisle. I found my window seat and tried to calm down. Deep breaths. The cabin filled with passengers, families, business travellers. A crying baby in row six. Normal people doing normal things. Flying was routine for them. During take off, my chest felt like it would cave in from the pressure. When the plane hit turbulence and dropped suddenly, I yelled. A kid behind me giggled before his mom shushed him. My face burned with embarrassment. But after an hour, I started to relax. The flight attendant, her name tag said Rebecca, brought me water and asked if I was okay. First time flying, she said kindly. You're doing great. I watched movies on the screen, played simple games on the remote. The fear faded into boredom. Maybe flying wasn't so terrible after all. Around hour three, they dimmed the cabin lights to blue. Most passengers tried to sleep in the cramped seats. I decided to do the same. Anything to make time pass faster. That's when I heard the whispers. Soft Voices speaking just below the hum of the engines. My drowsy mind couldn't make out the words, but something felt wrong about the rhythm. The cadence was too regular, like chanting. I fell asleep anyway. I woke up to silence. Complete, absolute silence. No engine noise, no air circulation, no passenger sounds. I rubbed my eyes and looked around the cabin. Every seat was empty. Not just empty. They look like nobody had ever sat in them. No blankets, no pillows, no personal items. The overhead bins were closed. Even the baby's car seat was gone. I stumbled into the aisle, my heart hammering. Hello? I called out. Rebecca? Anyone? My voice echoed strangely in the empty space. I checked the bathrooms, the galley, every row of seats. Nothing. I pressed my face to a window and saw we were still flying. Dark sky, stars, the faint outline of clouds far below. I was alone on a plane at 30,000 feet. I ran toward the cockpit, but the cabin just kept going. Row after row of empty seats, all identical. The blue

Most of our old photos got lost during one of the moves. I plugged the drive into my laptop and found dozens of video files organized by year. The quality was terrible, typical 90s camcorder footage. But seeing my younger self was amazing. I watched myself learning to walk, playing in various backyards, blowing out birthday candles in different houses. But something felt off in every video. We seem to be living in really nice houses with expensive furniture and big yards, way nicer than anything a construction worker could afford. I texted my dad asking about it, but he didn't respond. Then I got to the videos from 1997, when I would have been about 4 years old. The first clip showed me playing in a beautiful kitchen with marble countertops, while the woman's voice off camera encouraged Me. But it wasn't my mother's voice. Mom had died when I was two, and dad raised me alone after that. Who's that good girl? The woman said. Emma. Such a good helper. I paused the video. The woman sounded middle aged, kind. Nothing like the babysitter's dad occasionally hired. Watching and saw glimpses of her shadow moving around, but the camera never showed her face. The next video was dated three weeks later. Same kitchen, but now I was sitting at the table, crying, while Dad's voice tried to comfort me from behind the camera. It's okay, sweetheart. The nice lady had to go away. We're going to live somewhere new now. A chill ran down my spine. The timeline was adding up to something horrible. I jumped to 1998. New house, different kitchen, but the same pattern. Another woman's voice talking to me, teaching me to tie my shoes. Emma, you're getting so big. Soon you'll be starting kindergarten. Then three weeks later, the same scenario. Me crying, dad comforting me. Talk about moving again.

He texted me something terrifying before he disappeared. My brother Ethan always loved horror movies. So when Darkwood Entertainment hired him as a creature specialist at their new theme park, I wasn't surprised. The pay was incredible. Three times what he made at his old job. But the contract was weird. No photos allowed, no discussing work details, mandatory on site housing. It's just NDAs and corporate stuff, he told me over the phone after his first week. Monsters here are insane, though, Blake. Like, movie quality realistic. I can't believe they're just costume. He called me every Sunday for two months. Always excited, always raving about how authentic everything looked. Then the calls got shorter. Stranger. Blake, you know how some actors are just naturally gifted? He asked during what would be our last conversation. Like they become the character completely. Some of these guys never break character. Ever. That was three weeks ago. Yesterday. I got a text from his number at 3:00am. They're not costumes. Don't come looking for me. Tell mom I'm sorry. I drove to Darkwood Park immediately. The receptionist, a pale woman with hollow eyes, said Ethan had quit without notice, no forwarding address. When I asked to speak with management, she just stared at me until I left. But I didn't leave. I parked outside the employee housing complex behind the park and waited. At sunset, workers started trickling out. Some looked normal, tired. Carrying backpack, chatting on phones. Others moved differently, mechanical, like they were concentrating on walking upright. One of the normal workers, a girl, maybe 19, approached my car. You're looking for someone, aren't you? She whispered, glancing nervously at the other employees. Her name was Whitney. She worked there four months. Your brother trained me, she said. He was assigned to the werewolf in Midnight Forest. Big guy, seven feet tall, silver fur, beautiful craftsmanship. Except. Except what? It breathes. It has a heartbeat, and it only eats raw meat, Whitney explained to the real structure. Darkwood has 12 themed areas, each with two specialists and two creatures.

Last week, I found out the horrifying reason why. My dad has been feeding people in our basement for as long as I can remember. Every night at exactly 8:47, he would grab the leftover dinner, walk downstairs for 20 minutes, then come back up with an empty plate. I used to think this was completely normal until I realized how messed up it actually was. When I was 6, I asked my mom about the voices coming from downstairs. She just lit another cigarette and said, your father handles the basement handle upstairs. Her hands were shaking the whole time she said it. I could tell she was scared, but I didn't know why. The basement door was always locked with this huge deadbolt. I tried opening it once when I was eight, and my dad caught me. His face went completely white. He told me to never go down there because they weren't ready to meet me yet. But I could hear them. A little girl singing, A baby crying at three in the morning. Christmas was the weirdest time because my dad would bring two sets of presents. One pile for me and another armload that disappeared downstairs. I'd hear kids screaming with excitement while I opened my gifts alone upstairs. Mom would just chain smoke by the window, staring at nothing. When I turned 12, everything changed. The singing stopped. No more laughter, no more voices. Just Complete silence. But dad still brought food down every single night. He'd come back up faster, though, looking sick. Mom started drinking wine for breakfast. Convinced my best friend Trevor to sleep over that weekend. Maybe if someone else was there, dad would finally explain what was going on. But at 8:47, he grabbed the plate like always. Trevor followed me to the basement door. That's when we heard her. A woman's voice, desperate and hollow. Please let us out. Austin's getting older. He'll understand now. We've been good. We've been so good. Trevor's face went completely white. Dude, that's messed up. We should call someone. But dad was already coming back up. He saw us by the door and dropped the plate. It shattered everywhere. Boys, go to Austin's room now! That night, I heard my parents fighting for hours. Mom was sobbing, saying they couldn't keep doing this. Dad kept repeating, they need to stay down there. You know what happens if they don't. The next morning, Trevor's parents

I was expecting some romantic answer about how much she loves me or how I make her laugh or whatever normal couple stuff. She looked at me dead serious and said, because you asked. I thought she was joking, so I laughed it off, but then I pushed a little more. Okay, but, like, what made you say yes, though? And this woman, my wife of three years, looks me straight in the eye and says, because I trust your judgment. I just stared at her. What the hell does that even mean? So I asked her to explain, and she went into full professor mode. She told me love isn't enough to marry someone. That when she was in college, she was head over heels for this guy named Tyler, who was basically a walking disaster. Good looking, charming, but had no goals, no t shirts and energy drinks.

Losers get the basement. My younger brother, Marvin, pushed his food around his plate. My sister Bianca wouldn't even look up. We've been doing this for three months since we moved to this house. The basement had exposed pipes. heat. And spiders that dropped from the ceiling at night. Bianca won last month with her debate trophy. Dad continued, pulling out his notebook. So she keeps the room unless one of you beats her achievements this month. The chicken tasted like cardboard in my mouth. This is insane. Other families don't do this. Mom smile tightened. Other families raise weak children. We're raising winners. That night, Bianca came to my basement corner, where I'd hung sheets for privacy. I'm sorry, she whispered. Didn't wanna win, but sleeping down here made me sick last time. It's not your fault, I said, but the words felt hollow. Marvin had already stopped talking to both of us. The next morning, dad posted the point chart on the refrigerator. 10 points for A's, 20 for sports victories, 15 for volunteer hours, even five points for who said good morning first. I watched Marvin set his alarm for 4:00am. Just to beat us to the by week two, Bianca started hiding my homework. I found it crumpled in the trash after getting a zero. Marvin put a dead spider in my backpack during lunch, making me scream in front of everyone. We stopped eating together. Stop helping each other with assignments. Three kids living in the same house, acting like enemies. Look at that competitive spirit! Dad beamed one morning after Marvin and Bianca physically fought over who got to take out the trash for points. Mom took photos like it was something to be proud of. My grades started slipping from the stress. I couldn't sleep in the freezing basement constantly.

We didn't do a gender reveal with Connor because Jake kept changing his mind about when he wanted to find out. We ended up learning it was a boy like three weeks before I gave birth, and Jake literally cried tears of joy in the doctor's office. So two weeks ago, Jake said maybe I should just go to my appointment alone and find out without him. He said he was too nervous and would rather wait for the party.

He hasn't aged a single day. When I started teaching third grade at Rosewood Elementary, I thought I'd seen everything. But nothing prepared me for Ryan. He showed up on the second day of school clutching a class assignment sheet that said, Room 12, Mess Carter. Ryan Blackwood. I didn't remember his name on my roster, but kids get enrolled late all the time. Ryan was 8 years old. Blond hair, green eyes, small scar above his left eyebrow. Quiet kid who always sat in the back corner. Wore the same red hoodie every day. At the end of third grade, Ryan's parents apparently decided he needed to repeat the year. Academic struggles, they said. Weird, because Ryan was one of my brightest students. Fourth year of teaching, same thing. Ryan showed up again, clutching that assignment sheet. Same red hoodie, same corner seat. Still 8 years old. Fifth year, same Ryan. Same assignment sheet, same eight year old face. Sixth year, I started taking photos. Ryan in September looked identical to Ryan from five years ago. Same height, same baby teeth, same everything. Seventh year, I confronted the principal, showed her the photos. That's not the same child, she said. This year's student is Robert Blackwood, Ryan's younger brother. I looked at the photos again. Name on this year's assignment sheet had changed to Robert Blackwood in my hands. Eighth year, was Richard Blackwood. Same face, same scar. Same red hoodie that never faded. Ninth year brought Russell Blackwood. I started documenting everything. Every year, a new Blackwood boy who looked precisely like Ryan from five years ago. But in year 10, something changed. This year's assignment sheet read Ronald Blackwood. But when I looked at his face, his green eyes had no pupils, just solid green, like marbles. His skin had a waxy, artificial texture. During recess, he sat perfectly still for 30 minutes. Didn't move, didn't blink. Other kids played around him like he wasn't there. Ronald, are you okay? I asked. He turned his head toward me with a mechanical click. I'm fine, Miss Carter. His voice sounded hollow, like it was coming from inside a tunnel.

Some bridges need burning. My sister demanded I sleep with her husband to give them a baby because she was infertile. Rachel had always been the golden child, who once faked a cancer scare to steal attention at my wedding and later sued her bridesmaid for getting pregnant before her big day. She got dad's business connections and mom's jewellery collection while I scraped by with community college loans, then married rich and spent her days posting filtered photos or telling my seven year old daughter she was too fat for dance class. When I miscarried last year, she posted about it on Facebook before I could tell anyone, adding prayer hands, emojis and everything happens for reason while collecting sympathy likes. But now, after five years of her trying to conceive a baby, family suddenly meant everything to her. Her obsession with natural conception had cost them hundreds of thousands of dollars on fertility crystals and moon ceremonies. She refused IVF, calling it artificial poison, and wouldn't consider adoption because she needed to know her child's genetics. During Sunday dinner, she stared at my kids with tears streaming down her face, gripping her husband's hand until her knuckles turned white. That's when mom leaned over and whispered, you know, you have such beautiful children, and you and Rachel share the same DNA. And then two weeks later, the spa day invitation. That should have been my first warning, but I thought maybe she wanted To reconnect. Instead, I walked into her living room to find mom already there, both of them wearing matching silk robes and expectant. We have the perfect solution, Rachel announced, gesturing for me to sit between them. You're going to sleep with Dave and give us a baby naturally, the way nature intended. She said it like she was asking to borrow a cup of sugar, while mom nodded along like this was discussing vacation plan. I couldn't believe I was actually considering it. And Rachel didn't spare a second in sending me ovulation tracking apps and insisting I take fertility tests at her private clinic. She wore me down with daily phone calls and surprise visits, always with mom as backup. But then I found myself sitting in her marble bathroom letting her inject me with hormones. She had me taking supplements that made my skin crawl and my emotions swing wildly. My husband slammed doors and accused me of being insane for even considering it. I moved to his parents house. Well, I just kept hoping she come to her senses. Everything changed the day I was holding laundry and heard her on the phone with her best friend laughing about something. Dave asked for an open marriage last year, she said. My hands froze on a tiny pink shirt. This kills two birds. He gets his variety.

Three years ago, my coworker and I got married in Vegas for a work visa. The plan was brilliant. I needed to stay in the country. He needed my health insurance for his daughter's surgery. Quick courthouse wedding, two years of fooling immigration, then a quiet divorce. We high fived after signing the papers like we just pulled off a heist. We had. The first year was pure performance art. We memorized each other's birthdays, allergies, childhood pets. I Learned he takes his coffee with three sugars. He Learned I sleep on the left side. Immigration interviewed us twice. We passed by knowing things real couples probably didn't. We'd studied each other like a test. His daughter Emma called me daddy's friend even though I was at every soccer game. We had rules. No dating others for two years. Too risky. Separate bedrooms when no one was watching. Joint bank account for show. Separate finances for real. We wore our rings to work and family events. Took them off at home. Mine lived on my keychain, his in his gym bag. Year two, the lines blurred. I started making his coffee without thinking he'd already be on the left side of the couch, leaving my spot open. Emma started calling me by my name instead of daddy's friend. When she got sick. I drove them to the E R. At 3 a m. Without him asking. Stayed for seven hours. That Wasn't for immigration. We joke about our divorce party we throw in. Six months, made a Pinterest Board of freedom cakes. His mom kept asking when we'd give her grandchildren. We'd laugh and say, after the divorce, when she couldn't hear. She never knew it was fake. Still doesn't. Eight months ago, I was offered a job in London. Dream position, triple salary. I said yes immediately. The marriage was almost over anyway. That night he cooked dinner. Real dinner, not our usual takeout. So you're leaving? He said, not looking up from the cutting board.

Daddy? My teenage daughter started getting mysterious phone calls every afternoon. And I thought it was just normal teenager stuff. But then I noticed the pattern. Every day at 3:30 p m, her phone would ring with an unknown number. She'd immediately stop whatever she was doing and answer. On the first ring, her whole demeanor would change instantly. Voice dropping to a whisper, shoulders hunching forward, quickly walking to her room. When I. I asked who was calling, she'd just say, nobody important and close her door. Her behaviour started changing in other ways, too. She stopped hanging out after school. No more drama club meetings. No more study groups at the library. She'd rush home every single day, anxiously checking her phone every few minutes until that call came through. My husband thought I was being paranoid. She's 15. Girls have secrets. This is completely normal behaviour. But my mom instincts were screaming that something was seriously wrong. I started paying closer attention to these calls. She'd be on them for hours. Sometimes I could hear her through the door, speaking so quietly I couldn't make out words. But the tone was strange. Gentle, patient. Almost like she was comforting someone. No giggling like when she talked to friends. No complaining like when she talked to us. Just this soft, careful voice I'd never heard her use before. One afternoon, I was folding laundry outside her room when I heard her say something that made me freeze. I love you too, dad. See you tomorrow. Same time. My blood ran cold instantly. Her father was literally downstairs watching TV. Who was she calling? Dad? I knocked on her door immediately. She opened it, phone already hidden behind her back. Her face was red, eyes puffy, like she been crying. Everything okay, sweetie? I asked, trying to keep my voice casual. Fine, mom. Just talking to a friend about homework. But I saw her call log notification still glowing on her smartwatch. 2 hours and 43 minutes. What? Homework discussion lasted almost

I picked up my daughter Zoe from school Tuesday afternoon, and when I leaned over to kiss her forehead like I always did, she jerked away. Don't, dad. Miss Novak taught us that when you get kissed, the person's DNA stays inside you for seven years, like you're infected. She said, we're collecting other people's gross stuff and can't ever get it out. Her eyes welled up. Mom kissed me goodbye this morning. Does that mean I have her gross DNA stuck in me now? My hands tightened on the steering wheel. I teach AP biology at the high school across town. And not only was this scientifically false, it was psychologically damaging. That evening, I sent Miss Novak a polite email explaining that I was Zoe's father and a biology teacher, and that DNA from saliva breaks down within hours, not years. Her reply came quickly. Mr. Coleman, it was a simple lesson on DNA and germs. You know, how kids can traumatize things. Wouldn't worry about it. I tried to brush it off, figuring maybe she just misspoken or Zoe had misunderstood. But then Wednesday morning, Zoe refused breakfast, and when I asked why, she pushed her bowl away and said, yesterday Miss Novak was crying in class. She kept talking about this guy she used to date, like, three years ago. She said she can still feel his gross DNA inside her from when They kissed him and she called him a walking contamination or something. I nearly choked on my coffee. She's discussing her ex boyfriend with 12 year olds. Zoe nodded miserably. She was actually crying, dad. She said guys like Brad just want to infect girls with their DNA and then leave them. It was really weird. By Thursday, the parent group chat explode. Multiple children had come home terrified of physical contact. One mother wrote that her daughter wouldn't hug her uncle anymore because Miss Novak said men spread more DNA than women. Another parent said their son was dehydrated because he refused to use the water fountain after Miss Novak said drinking from it was basically like kissing everyone who used it before you, collecting years of their DNA in your mouth. First thing Friday morning, I met with Prince Vazquez alongside three other concerned parents. We presented our concerns about Miss Novak, discussing her personal dating life and teaching false science. The principal reviewed her file and found two previous complaints.

We'd stay up watching movies and she'd sneak me candy when mom said no more sugar. But she turned into a huge jerk when she came back home from her first semester of college. She start acting like a house was her personal hotel and everyone else was just in her way. First it was the TV. She changed all the streaming passwords so only she could log in. Even told our twelve year old brother to grow up when he wanted to watch cartoons on Saturday morning while she binged Love Island all day. Now, apparently, my bathroom was her territory, too. I tried to be considerate, I really did. I'd set my alarm 10 minutes earlier so I could be done before she woke up. I kept my shampoo and stuff in a basket so everything was clean and organized and she wanted to use it. And still she complained. Gwen told our parents I was hogging the bathroom every morning, even though I showered an hour before she woke up. She complained that the steam from my hot showers made the bathroom more moldy and toxic and gave her asthma. But it was summer, so I only took cold showers. Mom scolded me, telling Me to be more considerate of my sister. But that only made her lies older. She started setting her alarm for 6:00am just to me in the bathroom. Then she'd tell our parents I woke her up. So mom scolded me again, texting, be quieter next time. Your sister needs sleep. The lie that really got me into trouble was when Gwen claimed she lost her dream job at a marketing firm because I hogged the bathroom that morning. I finished my shower when I heard her phone blaring job interview today over and over. But Gwen was dead asleep. Now, I could have let her miss it, you know, especially after everything she done.

Three months after my wife died from cancer, my mother in law started going after me. She'd been staying with us to help with my nine year old daughter, Megan. And at first I was thankful, but then. And Megan came to me, twisting her hands together and said, daddy, why does grandma keep asking when we're selling the house and moving somewhere cheap? That should have been my warning sign. The real trouble began when she called CPS herself, telling them I was neglecting Megan and leaving her home alone while I slept all day from depression. The case worker, Miss Lane, showed up with her clipboard already out and her pen clicking. And two days later, my mother in law filed for emergency custody. I tried explaining I work from home, but Lane just kept her eyes on her notepad, scribbling away. And my chest got tight watching her write down whatever story she'd already decided was true. My lawyer, Tom, was the only one who believed my side of things. When I brought him the custody papers, I watched his eyebrows shoot up as he spread them across his mahogany desk, pointing to different sections where my mother in law had brought up the life insurance trust fund three times in documents that were supposed to be about Megan safety. Why would she keep mentioning money and papers about keeping Megan safe? Tom tapped the papers with his Pen and said we needed to look deeper into her motivations. That's when pieces started falling into place. Bought a leather journal and started tracking everything. After Miss UNT. Lane's second surprise visit, the pattern was obvious. Once I started writing it down. Lane would show up unannounced with her clipboard, and somehow my mother in law's silver car would appear within minutes. Every single time, she'd step out with her hand pressed over her heart. Playing the worried grandmother perfectly. Tom's investigator changed everything when he slid that Manila folder across the desk. My mother in law owed $200,000 in tax liens. The dates made my stomach drop. Filed just two months before

The kid was six feet tall with arms thicker than my legs. Meanwhile, Georgie was maybe 90 pounds, soaking wet, with these skinny arms that look like twigs. His left arm was in a homemade sling made from an old T-shirt. I stared at the money, thinking this had to be some kind of joke. Nobody in their right mind would pay someone to fight Carson.

I rejected my childhood friend for his brother, and now, 12 years later, I'm the one trying to win him back. I missed my best friend, Gavin, and I never got to tell him. Not after I heard him so badly he stopped talking to me and his own family. Why not just get him to forgive you? My mom asked, handing me Rex's wedding invitation. His brother, the guy I chose over Gavin 12 years back. F it, why not? It was there that I saw him the first time in years. Gavin, now taller, breathtaking and cold. I smiled and waved at him, but he looks right through me during the rehearsal dinner, like I was wallpaper. Just walk. Don't look at me, don't talk to me, Gavin said during the practice run. Should we at least try to pretend we're okay? He replied sharply. I've been pretending you don't exist for 12 years. One more day won't kill me. He sat far from me at dinner, left when I entered rooms, hopped over me when I tripped, and fell flat on my face. Even when Rex joked about baby brother, old crush, Gavin just yawned as if he was bored. Even thinking about me, it hurt, but all I could think was how he used to wait for me after school, carrying me on his back. When I got hurt at the wedding, my first goal was to get Near him, I switched our place cards, only to watch him switch seats. I wrote I'm sorry I called you a liar on a napkin and slipped it under his water glass. He looked at it, looked back at me, then used it to wipe up spilled champagne. Every plan failed spectacularly, but one thing did. Pick away at the ice around him. When a bridesmaid started crying, I sat on the floor with her, fixed her makeup, and made her laugh through the tears. I glanced up and Gavin was in the doorway, watching with a soft smile. I looked away, embarrassed, but when I looked back, he was gone. A lost opportunity that made me want to bang my head on the table. By eleven PM, I knew I blew it. I drank down a glass of champagne and sat in the back of the room, feeling sad and best friendless. I watched the groom, Rex, stand up to give his drunk and sloppy speech. Thank you all for coming here. And thanks also to my ex. He pointed at me. I sat up straight.

My 16 year old daughter Peyton used to be my perfect kid who played volleyball and got straight A's. Then I discovered her secret Instagram pregnancy shaming account, and everything I believed about her shattered. My hands were shaking as I scrolled through months of posts. Peyton was screenshotting girls from school after lunch or pool photos and circling their stomachs with red arrows claiming pregnancy. I felt sick reading the brutal comments calling these girls horrible names. One girl switched schools, another was on anxiety medication. My perfect daughter had 10,000 followers and was making money from ads while destroying girl girls lives over normal body changes. I couldn't believe this was my child. Three days later, Janet grabbed my arm at work with trembling hands. Her daughter had tried to end herself, leaving a note about the pregnancy shaming page. That night at dinner, Peyton's laugh made me flinch. She shoved her phone at me. Look at this girl claiming she just had a big lunch. It's so obviously a baby bump. My stomach dropped. It was Janet's daughter. I watched my child giggle at a girl who nearly died and felt something break inside me. For a whole week, I stayed up late studying how Peyton destroyed these girls. I made my own anonymous account and followed the same gossip pages she did. Every night after she went to bed, I'd scroll through her Posts learning exactly how she used those red arrows and shocked emojis. Her birthday was coming up and I knew she'd post from that Italian place she loved. When she posted birthday feast food baby that night my heart was pounding. I screenshot everything and opened the editing app. My hands trembled circling her stomach just like she'd done to dozens of girls. I typed popular volleyball player hiding pregnancy.

My daughter was invited to a classmate's birthday party at a bowling alley. The event was an all girls party, and from what I could tell, there were about 17 girls in attendance. He arrived about five minutes late and walked in at the same time as another classmate, Betty. Due to a bit of a line, it took about 10 minutes for both girls to get their bowling shoes and head toward the reserved lanes. The hostess had booked three adjacent lanes. Like most bowling setups, each pair of lanes had a shared seating area with curved benches. When we got there, I noticed that lanes one and two already had several girls names programmed. On lane three, an adult male, someone I didn't recognize, was programming names into the system. When Annie approached the group, she was told to go to lane three. I greeted a few parents and noticed Annie walk away. I asked where she was going, and she said she'd been told to go find a blue bowling ball because it was lighter. I checked and realized the ball she was heading toward was actually 14 pounds. I went to find a lighter one and brought it back to her. A parent nearby asked if I was bowling. I said, no, just helping Annie get the right ball. At that moment, the dad of another girl, Called out to Betty that her name had been added to lane 2, and the birthday girl's mom, Dana, the hostess, came over. I asked her if Annie could be added to either lane one or two, assuming that all the girls would be mixed across the three lanes. Dana told me Annie was on lane three. I was surprised, so I walked over to look. Sure enough, Annie's name was on lane three. The only people bowling there were Annie and the adult male along with

I admit it. I messed up. I had forgotten my phone was on silent, and so for two hours straight, I sweated my butt off on Smash Bros. At my friend's house and forgot to text my girlfriend Cindy back. So when I finally saw her, 15 missed calls, she was furious. I need to know you're actually where you say you are, she said. But I already sent you my location and a picture of us on the coach. It's not enough. What if there are girls hiding behind you on the couch? Or what if it's just an old picture? I'm not stupid. From now on, when you're out, we video call so I can see. Or you can wake up single the next day. She hung up, practically foaming at the mouth. The first few calls were painfully awkward. I'd have to go around the house, introduce each of my friends to her, basically give her a house tour to show it's all clear before she hang up. And randomly call again in the next hour or so to make sure I didn't change locations or invited over girls to my friend's house. After a few days like this, everyone was going crazy over her rule. My friend Jeff pulled me to the side with a concerned look. Dude, honestly, if she's gonna act crazy, you gotta do it, too. That's when it came to me. A brilliant idea. The next time I was at Jeff's house, I answered Cindy's call in my best David Attenborough voice. Here we observe the male human in his natural habitat. Approaching the buffalo wings with caution, I slowly turned the camera towards my friends, who immediately caught on and started acting like wildlife. In the background, dinner was pretending to be a gazelle and Jeff was chest beating like a gorilla. Very funny, Cindy said, rolling her eyes at us. The next Friday, we took it further. I answered the call holding a microphone, reading out a fake weather forecast, while Jeff held up a map glued to a pizza box. Currently, we're experiencing a high pressure system of Mario Kart moving through the living room area, I announced. Temperatures are rising as we travel through Rainbow Road. Now back to you, Cindy. Stop being weird.

We adopted Jalen when he was 8. His birth mom was my younger sister who overdosed when he was 6, and his dad was nowhere to be found. I was 32 at the time with no kids of my own, and my husband Mike was completely on board. We figured we'd give Jalen the stable home he deserved after bouncing between foster homes for two years. Ellen was this quiet, serious kid who'd seen way too much for his age. He'd flinch whenever we raised our voices, even if we were just calling him for dinner from the other room. It took months before he'd laugh at my terrible dad jokes or let us hug him without going stiff. But slowly, he started opening up. He'd help Mike in the garage on weekends, asked me to pack extra snacks for school, started calling us mom and dad around his 10th birthday. For years, everything was perfect. Helen made good grades, played baseball in middle school, had friends over for sleepovers. We never hid his adoption from him, but he seemed completely settled with us. When he turned 16, I taught him to drive in our old Honda Civic. Mike took him fishing every summer. We were a real family. But then his senior year, something changed. Jalen started asking more questions about his birth family. Where they lived, if he had any siblings, what happened to his dad, I tried to be honest but gentle, telling him what little I knew. His birth mom had struggled with addiction, bounced around a lot, made poor choices. His dad had left when Jalen was 3 and never came back. One day in February, Jalen came home from school acting weird. He kept checking his phone during dinner and barely touched his food.

My dad's jeans had cursed me with a body better suited for cross country than contact sports. But I didn't wanna run in circles. I wanted to play football. Coach Morris looked at me like I was roadkill when I showed up for tryouts. 30 seconds into my first drills, I heard it. Wilson, what are you doing here? The chess club meets in the library. The team erupted in laughter. Kept my mouth shut. Finish the drill. You're gonna get yourself killed out here, kid. Coach said afterward, why don't you try something else? Maybe track? I looked him straight in the eye. I wanna play. He sighed. Fine. You can be equipment manager, help with practice. Maybe in a few years, if you grow. So that's what I did. I washed jerseys, fixed helmets, set up cones and filled water bottles while the actual players got to play. After everyone left, I'd run the same drills they did. I set up tackling dummies and hit them until my shoulders ache. I studied playbooks like they were sacred tech. Junior year, I grown two inches and added 20 pounds of muscle. Still small, but solid. I tried out again. This time I didn't just run drills. I demolished them. My 40 yard dash was second fastest on the team. My route running was precise. My hands never dropped a pass. Not bad, coach admitted. But this isn't a practice drill. This is varsity football. Those guys across town would snap you like a twig. He put me on special teams. The Suicide Squad. Just bodies to throw at kick returns. First game of the season, I flew down the field on kickoff, weaving through blockers twice my size, and made a tackle that echoed through the stadium. The crowd erupted. Coach ignored it, called it lucky. Then I did it again the next game. And the next. By mid season, I forced two fumbles on kick returns. Fans started chanting will, son! Will, son! Whenever kickoff came. Except for Brandon Reeves, our star quarterback and the coach's godson. 6 foot 3, college scouts at every game. Arrogance as big as his arm. He made it his mission to.

I bought my first house last year after saving for six years. It's not fancy, but it's mine. My sister Emma is 25, dropped out of college twice, and still lives in mom's basement. Last month she announced she's pregnant with some guy named Dave, already has three kids with two different women, and works part time at a gas station. Yesterday, mom calls saying they want to stop by and see how I've decorated the place. She's never cared about my decorating before, but now she insisted on bringing Emma along. They show up at 6 p m. With measuring tape, notebooks, and Emma's carrying a folder full of paint samples. I thought maybe Emma wanted decorating tips for her own future place. Boy, was I wrong. Emma immediately starts walking through every room like she's conducting a home inspection. She's measuring doorways and windows with her phone app, taking photos of electrical outlets, and making notes about where the crib would go. And this would be perfect for a nursery. She even opens my closets and starts talking about storage space for baby clothes. Mom sitting on my couch like she's conducting a business meeting, nodding approvingly at everything Emma says. Every few minutes, she'd call out suggestions like, don't forget to measure for the changing table and check if that window gets good morning light. After 30 minutes, Of this increasingly weird behavior. I finally asked what was going on. Mom puts down her notebook and drops the nuke. We've been doing a lot of thinking about Emma's situation lately. She needs a stable environment for the baby. And honestly, you're single with all this extra space. It just makes perfect sense when you really think about it. I'm standing there confused. When she continues without missing a beat. Emma's going to move in next month with Dave, and they'll start.

My family discovered I was good with kids when I was 14 and babysat my cousin once. That single afternoon turned me into their unpaid nanny for the next 12 years. My sister would drop off her toddler for just an hour while she ran to target. One hour became three, then six, until she'd stroll back with fresh acrylic nails, a Starbucks Frappuccino, and zero apologies. I remember sitting on my bedroom floor surrounded by broken crayons and goldfish crackers, realizing I'd missed my entire shift at the local coffee shop because of her lies. Then my brother discovered the family gold mine. Midnight texts became routine. Emergency babysitting needed. The twins, regular sitter canceled. Of course, the emergency was always tickets to concerts, bar crawls, or weekend getaways with his girlfriend. I Learned to sleep with my phone on silent. College should have been my escape, but my family had other plans. My sister would show up unannounced at my dorm, sometimes driving four hours just to dump her kids on me for entire weekends. He cost me my first serious girlfriend when she called during our anniversary dinner screaming about a fake emergency. I watched her look at me across that candlelit table and say she couldn't compete with my family's chaos anymore. After graduation, things got worse. My parents, claiming they wanted to help me settle in, secretly made copies of My apartment keys and distributed them to my siblings like VIP passes. I dragged myself home from my marketing job exhausted from client presentations, only to find my living room transformed into a daycare center, toys scattered everywhere, juice boxes leaking on my white couch, and kids I hadn't even agreed to watch. My boss pulled me aside after I missed my third important presentation.

I giggled nervously. Um, yeah, why? No, no, no, no, no, she suddenly screamed while walking as far away from me as possible. I just laughed because moms can be so weird sometimes. But the next day, my daughter came home from school crying. Mommy, Leah said her mom said she can't talk to me anymore. Leah was her best friend. I immediately took out my phone and texted her mom asking if everything was okay. No response. I texted Emily's mom, one of the other girls in her trio. Still nothing. I had just managed to calm my baby girl down when the pizza arrived. Usually our delivery guy is the Apator 5,000. But tonight he just set the box on my doorstep and practically ran away. George, you forgot your tip, I yelled, waving a 20. He just kept going. The next few days were insane. At my daughter's soccer practice, Helen saw me walking towards her and held her phone to her ear. No one had even called her. Helen, what's going on? She mouth, sorry and walked faster. We used to complain about our husbands together. Parents were whispering and showing each other something on their phones. When I walked by, they'd quickly put them away. By Thursday, my daughter was refusing to go to school. They moved my desk away from everyone else. The Teacher said it was for space reasons, but there's like 10 feet between me and Leah now. I tried to bring her to the hairdresser to cheer her up, but when the woman saw me coming, she closed early. No apology. Just flipped the sign and pulled the blinds. My phone buzzed. It was my landlord. Heard what happened. So sorry, rent can wait this month. This was the same man who charged me a 50 dollar inconvenience fee when I paid rent at 12:00am instead of midnight. Then the birthday party, Emily's sleepover. My daughter found out that everyone was invited except her. She was having such a bad panic attack that I had to call a hospital. Mom, what did I do? Emily is my best friend. Enough was enough. I called the school office. Something is happening to my daughter. She's being systematically excluded and I need answers right now. The counselor called back within an hour, but her voice was off like she was choosing every word carefully. Missus Cal, Hannah, we just wanted to check in about your home environment. Is everything safe? Anyone new spending time around your daughter? What? What are you even asking me? I think it's best if we discuss this in person. Can you come in tomorrow morning? No. You'll tell me right now why my daughter is being tortured. Long pause. The principal will explain everything tomorrow. Beep. She hung up. Then at eleven PM, an email from my Gym membership terminated effective immediately. I've been going there for five years. The owner knew me by name. I was trying to figure out what to do when my daughter crawled into my bed at 2:00am sobbing, Mommy, am I ugly? It took everything in me not to burst into tears. The lunch lady wouldn't look at me today. She just pointed at my tray. I finally caved. On Saturday morning, I found myself walking towards the principal's office while being escorted by a security guard. Other parents there for Saturday sports held their kids against the walls as we passed. One mom literally shielded her son with her body like we were dangerous. In his office, the principal locked the door behind us. The click was so loud in the silence, he walked to the windows and twisted the blinds shut. My daughter grabbed my hand tighter. Please sit down. I'll stand. What is this about? He sat at his desk, fingers hovering over his keyboard, then pulled them back. Mister Griffin, you're scaring me. Missus Callahan. He was looking at his screen, not at me. When did you last speak to your ex husband? Christmas. Why? And you haven't been in contact since then? No communication at all? No. We exchange texts about pickup times maybe once a month. What does this have to do with anything? He turned his monitor slightly, then back like he was debating something. Some information has come to our attention about your Former husband, the parents. What information? What are you talking about? I need to show you something, but I want you to prepare yourself. My legs felt weak. I sat down, pulling my daughter onto my lap. It's from two weeks ago. The parents have been. He paused. I've been very concerned. He finally turned the screen toward me. Local news website. The headline hit me first, then his face, my ex husband's face in a mugshot. Full story on channel link below.

It started at Thanksgiving when my cousin wouldn't shut up about me being single. She kept asking why I never brought anyone home, making these fake concerned faces at the dinner table. So when she said I must be dating someone special, I just nodded, gave him a name right on the spot. Daniel said he was busy with work. My family ate it up. But then Christmas rolled around and my mom started asking when she could meet Daniel. My aunt kept texting about setting an extra place at dinner. I was stuck. That's when my roommate Becca suggested her co worker Daniel, who owed her big time for covering his shifts. He showed me his Instagram, tall brown hair, actually decent looking. He agreed to one dinner as a favor. The problem, he didn't just show up and fake smile through dinner. He brought flowers for my mom, asked my dad about his woodworking hobby and somehow knew my grandmother collected vintage tea cups because I'd mentioned it once when building the fake story. He even laughed at my little brother's terrible jokes about robots. My family was obsessed. After that first dinner, my mom kept inviting him back. Mr brunch, my cousin's graduation party, random Sunday dinners. Daniel never said no. He text me beforehand asking what to bring, if anyone had allergies, stuff like that. He started sending my brother updates about basketball scores, my Dad asked him to help fix our back porch. The worst part was how natural it felt. We drive to my parents house together and he'd ask about my day like we actually dated. He remembered my coffee order, knew I hated mushrooms, grab my jacket when I got cold. During family game night, he'd automatically pick me as his partner. We had inside jokes that weren't even planned. One night after my aunt's birthday party, we sat in his car outside my apartment in complete silence. Everyone had spent the whole night saying how perfect we looked together, how lucky I was. My grandmother even pulled me aside to say Daniel was a keeper. The whole car ride home, I kept stealing glances at him, wondering what he was thinking. I started rehearsing speeches in my bathroom mirror, practice bringing it up casually over coffee. But every time I opened my mouth, nothing came out. How do you tell someone you caught feelings for a fake relationship? Everything changed at Christmas dinner. My aunt announced she'd been looking at wedding venues for us, said she found the perfect place for next fall. Daniel laughed it off perfectly, made some joke about her getting ahead of herself. But later that night, he texted me, we can't keep this up forever, you know, that message hit me like a truck. I realised he was ready to end this whole thing and I wasn't, not even close. Instead of texting back or Giving him some weird speech. I invited him over for dinner at my place, cooked his favourite pasta dish, the one my mom always made when he came over, set the table with actual candles, not just the overhead light. After we finished eating, I was washing dishes and he was drying them, just like we did at my parents house. That's when I finally said it. I know this.

Nobody likes a lunch thief and I had one of the most aggressive at my office. There were rumors for a few months leading up to the inciting incident of someone going around and taking people's lunches. Just about every day someone different would complain that their lunch was missing. It even happened to me once or twice. But I figured, hey, it's a big office. A few people are probably just careless and grab the wrong lunch and are too embarrassed to bring it back. Or someone else packs their lunch and they don't know what's in there so it's not obvious they have the wrong one or whatever. Most people just brought brown bags with their names on it anyways or identical rubber made Tupperware with a little piece of label tape on the side. It was easy enough to mix it up. I had accidentally grabbed the wrong lunch once or twice, but I'd noticed before I got it open. I thought I was just more careful or even just not as busy as some other people in the building. However, other people weren't as forgiving and a quorum made complaints to HR. They were blown off. Personally at the time I thought it was all much ado about nothing. But then it began. My wife enrolled in a French cooking class online and just about every day I was Bringing fancy gourmet leftovers in for lunch, you'd think I was picking up a to go bag from a Michelin starred bistro on the way in. Each morning, she really threw herself into the coursework. There were no problems for about two weeks, maybe three, until one day my lunch went missing. Considering what delicacies I had to look forward to, I was pretty miffed. But I did it once over around the break room and didn't see anyone eating my lunch. So figured someone grabbed my bag by accident earlier, saw how good things looked and realizing it was their lucky day, didn't bring it back to the fridge. I wrote the mysterious stranger off as an asshole, but accepted the loss and looked forward to dinner that night instead. Next day, I write my name on my lunch in extra bold lettering, jam the bag into the back of the fridge and feel peace of mind. I get there come break time, nope, it's gone. I was pretty upset, but I figured it was a stroke of bad luck and left it at that. What else could I do? However, on the third day, out of an abundance of caution, I kept my lunch at my desk. A pain because I had to eat it fairly early in the day to avoid spoilage, but at least I'd know where it was. I got up to take care of some business down the hall and when I came back, Yep, my lunch was gone. Unfortunately, that didn't help me narrow it down much at all because my desk is centrally located, so everyone's constantly passing by. At that point, there was no possibility of the theft being arbitrary. So I approached HR and filed a complaint. Their response, practically verbatim was employees lunches are their personal property and the company is not responsible for lost or stolen personal item.

I had an employee who was a strict vegetarian for religious reasons. One day we were discussing the employee salad bar and he mentioned how much he loved the Caesar dressing packets they offered. I was surprised and stupidly blurted out, oh, I didn't realize you ate fish. He responded that he was vegetarian and gave me a quizzical look. I had to explain that the salad dressing contained both fish and Parmesan cheese, which is almost always cultured with animal rennet. He didn't believe me and the next day insisted on reading the ingredients on one of the packets to me to prove to me that I was wrong. Then he got to the anchovies and got quiet, too. My best friend in high school was humongous and would sweat profusely. We would come in after lunch in Texas and he would smell awful. I think he would wear his clothes without washing them after sweating. We had English after and the AC sucked, so the teacher put a fan in the window. He would sit in front of the fan and blow his funk over everyone. The class got together and voted that I should be the one to tell him. Well, I had to break it to him that for the last year, he has smelled horribly. I felt pretty bad, but he never stunk again. 3. I had to tell My friend that the online girlfriend he'd been talking to for months was actually a scammer using stolen photos. He was planning to send her money to come visit. And breaking the news to him was one of the toughest conversations I've ever had. 4. I had a friend ask me about some green sign in the distance. It was in fact a bright orange sign giving off an intense orange light, which sodium vapor is known for. I had to tell him right there that he was colorblind. He was in his mid 30s too. A lot of odd things that had happened in his past fell into place for him that day. Five, I had to tell my mom that my grandma, her mom didn't make it and had been buried a month before. My mom had been in a coma for around six weeks during that time. At one point they were actually in the ICU in beds beside each other. Neither ever knew. So yeah, that sucked. 6. I had an old friend that I lived with at the time. He'd been getting obviously catfished for years, thankfully not monetarily. Just a lonely girl looking for attention over the phone and internet. But he just refused to believe the signs. He claimed to have talked a bunch on the phone and we didn't really believe him. Eventually she asked for money for a ticket and we were all like, there it is. And he finally believed Us. He decided to put it to a test to prove it once and for all and told her that he'd bought her a ticket for the flight, assuming she'd make up an excuse to get out of it. He didn't really buy the ticket. Well, to his surprise, the day of, he got a call from her at the airport panicking because they couldn't find the ticket. He managed to play it off as a mistake and was able to get her on the flight. They dated for 5 years and she came out every summer for like 5 years before they grew apart. So guess I was wrong. Seven, I hate to break it to you, but the hardest moment was telling my best friend that their partner was for the streets. They were so in love and completely blinded by it. And when I broke the news, it shattered their world. It even strained our friendship for a while because sometimes even when you're trying to help, the truth is too painful to accept. 8, an employee confided in me that she contracted the clap and was talking about how she got it from the toilet seat at work because she is monogamous with her husband. I was like, girl, he ain't monogamous with you. 9, my wife telling me that she wants a divorce about 30 minutes ago. I sure hope that I will be okay. Later, it struck me like lightning. 10 when my ex Tried to make me choose between my dog and him.

One, how 24 hour it is. Nobody even blinks when you get up at 3:00am to meet a flight or make a deployment muster. Half the people you know are asleep at three PM their duty next week will probably be different. So you meet friends for cards or a meal at 6:00am or six PM doesn't really matter. Also the different food you eat. After a couple of decades of chow line food, Pan Global, Military Wife Pot locks and TDY and Turd World dumps, you don't even care if you have never seen that dish before in your life or if it's squirming. If the guy next to you isn't deceased, you will probably eat it too. Never leave your Tabasco bottle at home so you can get the bugs too. How non military life on a submarine is. It's already a stressful environment so nobody really wants to pile on top of that. Don't get me wrong, they do their jobs and they do them well. But this straight laced military bearing you see in movies is not really there. My command had to gently remind enlisted types not to refer to the junior officers by their first names. Under way, shaving daily was a luxury. So everyone had some sort of stubble, hair got too long, uniforms, coveralls got torn, stained and just generally jacked up, especially if you worked in the engine room. We all Wore civilian sneakers or slip ons as Navy boots made way too much noise. All that said, if there was a real or simulated emergency, everyone immediately shifted to 100% by the book. Those were some of the finest, most prepared people I've ever worked with. So if you want to see real life on a submarine, watch down. Periscope 3. I found that the idea of a chain of command really messes with the heads of those who never served in the military. 4, dependapotamus. It's something I Learned about a few years ago. Basically, the young guys are desperate to get better housing, so they get married to women who prey on young military men because they get good benefits, health, pension. The women are dependents. The potomus comes from the idea that most of them end up getting gluttonous and slothful, mooching off of their husbands who are away at war and get rather large. It's sad.

Moment one the other day my 18 year old brother in law got married to his high school sweetheart in a parking garage so that they can live off campus at college together. His now wife's mother is an ordained minister. His parents, my in laws were very upset and he couldn't understand why saying it's just a fake marriage for school. Oh no, sweet boy, you are married. I just laughed and laughed. I love him dearly but he's a moron. His wife lost her scholarship because they live off campus and became residents of the state and she no longer qualifies. 2. My dad used to be the typical boomer, always thinking I was just being lazy and not doing things right until he got injured and could no longer work in an industry he had 30+ years of experience and seniority in. It took him several months to get a new job of any kind and was shocked when he realized that he couldn't just negotiate for higher pay. He was fired on the spot when he threatened to organize a strike and was barred from the premises. When he had to move, it baffled him that he couldn't just give the landlord a few hundred bucks and move in right away but had to wait a week for his application to go through and the landlord to do a background check. Probably my Most satisfying one was when he finally decided to get into the industry. I'm in truck driving. He Learned very fast that it wasn't like it is in the movies from the 80s. Truckers don't know nor ever have given a darn about one another. Sure, some are nice to one another, but if it's a choice of you or them, don't hold your breath. Most big trucking companies in the US are only concerned about your safety because it saves them money on lawsuits. After his third trucking job ended with him getting terminated and is now living off my income, he stopped giving me crap about my problems and is still job hunting. 3. There was a young girl I used to work with a target. She was hired for the 6:00am to two thirty PM shift, but she regularly showed up between 8 to 9:00am without any good explanation. After the third time or so, our supervisor asked her if she had something to do in the morning such as getting kids ready for school that required a later shift. If so, she could be moved to the 8:00am to four thirty PM shift. Girl's response was no, I still want to leave at 2:30. I just don't want to get up that early. She was fired when she refused to acknowledge that you cannot make your own schedule. 4. My boss told me about a friend of his who told him they have a life hack She would get her bills in the mail, not pay them, and then wait a couple of months to pay. Then she would cry so the debt collectors would feel bad and waive the fees for not paying on time. That was her brilliant life. Hack. 5, a dude 18 years old in boot camp got a letter from home and I could see he was agitated being 22 and concerned for his well being. I asked him if he wanted to talk about it. I'm thinking a Dear John letter or the mom and dad divorcing letter. He told me that his younger brother got a Mercedes for his birthday and that he was upset because he only got a BMW. Can't remember what I said, but I knew boot camp was gonna do him in. It did. 6, when I was in boot camp, some kid put his letter addressed to mom with no address attached. 7. They did a study and there's a lot of people who have winning the lottery part of their retirement plan. 8. My old roommate was only paying $25 on her credit cards every month, but was putting almost every purchase on them. I felt so bad explaining to her that she was now in credit card debt. 9, girl asks me to do her shift for her. She has a doctor's appointment, okay, on payday, she asked for the money for that shift. Uh, no, it doesn't work that way.

One, 20 years ago I was standing on my back porch lighting up and talking on the phone. This cop comes out of the forest behind the house soaking wet and covered in MUD. He walked right up into my yard and I asked if he needed help. He told me to get my fat ass back into the house or he'd arrest me. I just stood there as that cop walked through my yard and away to wherever he was going. 2, About 35 years ago when I was a teenager, the house was broken into. Detectives thought I did it as an inside job. My dad had me sit down with them for questioning. After laughing at the accusation, I realized they were serious and told them no and clammed up. After I asked why my dad would put me in front of them with no warning that I was a suspect, like did he think it was me? He said, I think it could have been you. I never did anything illegal like that in my life. For him to think that definitely rocked my relationship with him. Three thirty seven years ago, I was five and had spent two years saving up $10 worth of pennies. I used to count them, 10 pennies in a pile. Ten piles is $1. I kept them in an empty coffee ground can. One day the jar was empty and we had Pizza for dinner. She made me thank her boyfriend for the pizza. 4. I was kicked out of a bar spelling B for spelling a word correctly. The word was Lilliputian like from Gulliver's Travels. I spelled it correctly. They had it without the double L. I showed them I was correct and they still wouldn't let me back in the spelling bee. This was like five years ago. I'm still super bitter. 5. In my junior year of high school, my parents purchased a car for me, but I made all the payments by working 20 hours a week at a local pizzeria. One weekend my mom asked me to take her car 10 minutes into town to the car wash and wash it. I got back about an hour later and my car was gone. They had an offer from someone my dad worked with, so they sold it right out from under me. I never got the money from the sale. 6 during the lockdown, I graduated from college. It was a huge deal. I was the first in my family. They did a zoom ceremony and the presenter accidentally skipped over my name. My family was all watching waiting for them to call my name via live stream and of course the presenter never fucking did. It was just as devastating for them as it was for me. I will never forget my mom saying, I don't understand. Our name should have been there. Our name Ours. I was graduating for us.

What's the saddest thing someone ever returned? One, I used to be a manager for a Disney store. We had a regular old man come in with his wife regularly. Super cute couple. I mean, matching outfits, holding hands, just cute as could be. We used to sell these huge stuffed animals, like ginormous. The couple came in about once a week and would just walk around, laugh and smile, buy things here and there. One night he came in on his own and bought one of these gigantic Mickey's we had. It was $300, I think. He was so excited. He told us all about how he was going to take her out to dinner and it would be sitting there on the bed to surprise her when they got home. Anyway, two days later, he walked back in carrying the gigantic Mickey Mouse plush to return it. He had bought it to surprise her for her 75th birthday. She passed away in her sleep the day before her birthday. He thanked us and said goodbye and that he would not be coming back because our store reminded him too much of his wife. We found out he passed away a week later, was just seven days from the day his wife passed. We found out all the details because one of our employees went to the same church they attended. Two customers regularly come in with large amounts of baby supplies, returns. They Get the wrong gender items or duplicates. An older woman came in with a cartload so I asked about the new baby. She slowly and through tears explained that her only child and grandbaby didn't make it during childbirth. 3. Not a return, but I worked in a jewelry store and the saddest sale we ever had was a labor. The guy had this ring on labor for 12 months but passed in a car accident. His parents came in and picked up the ring so his girlfriend could keep it. I don't think she had any idea he was going to propose. 4, I work at a store in a college town and one night some younger guy was returning a keg barrel only was still half full. I jokingly asked the guy if it was a trash party or something along those lines and he responded with, yeah, it was a party for one of our friends who passed the day of the party. Five, I was working at a large pet store in the tropical fish department. One busy weekend a very well dressed, rather snobby woman came in and bought six baby angel fish, each about the size of a dime plus the fins. The store I worked in was inside a huge high end shopping mall so we had a holding service where we would bag up fish, cash the customer out and float the fish in their bags in a warm tank until the Customer was finished all their shopping and was ready to leave for home. As a matter of course, I offered to hold this lady's baby angel fish. She said she was all good and left. Four or five hours later, she stormed back into the store demanding a manager and a refund. She was shaking the bag in our faces for emphasis, yelling that her gorgeous angels were all deceased. On close inspection, we discovered that the silly woman had put the poor fish in her car, presumably so she didn't need to carry them while she shopped for other things or returned to the store to pick them up. Unfortunately, because it was January and the temperature outside was extremely cold, the tiny babies had frozen. 6. A guy was returning baby formula and he was looking pretty down. I asked him how his day was and he said that he has been having a long day and that he's been having a long month too. I thought he just had a baby, so maybe he just got the wrong formula. I asked if he just had a baby and he said he used to have a baby. I told him I was sorry and he said it was okay. There were a few minutes of silence and he said he was a fun little guy, seen a lot of things, but that one broke my heart.

One maybe 22 years ago, I had a phone interview with a baking company. I didn't care to have my peers know what I was up to, so I took the call on my cell phone in my car. The call was crystal clear and no technical issues. At one point, they had mentioned the weather and asked how it was where I was. I told him that I was sitting in my car and I could see that it was actively snowing and what not. The interviewer asked me, are you taking this call on a cell phone? I told him I was. Then he asked me if I thought that was appropriate. I asked him what he meant by that. He said he thought it was kind of rude to take a formal call on a cell phone. I told him I would be more than happy to conclude the interview if talking on a cell phone was an issue. If he was interested, I'd be happy to continue it the next day when I'd be at a desk. He again repeated how rude he thought it was that I had called from a cell phone and that there was no need to continue the interview process. I disagreed with the first point, but did agree with the second. To this day, I wonder what in the world he was talking about and where he was. Coming from too. At my wedding we marked the vegetarian items as vegetarian. This made the one vegetarian in my wedding sister in law who hates me fly into a catatonic rage because we are singling out the vegetarian food as vegetarian and not treating it as normal food. Then how the heck are they supposed to know it's vegetarian? Guess she wanted to be able to ask so then everybody knows they're vegetarian lol. Three. I once listened to my boss try to lecture the fire marshal because he was talking about something being flame retardant. Her reasoning was you should just call it fireproof because retardant was an awful word. It was one of those times where I really should have tried to stop her, but instead I just stood off to the side making a surprise Pikachu face. Four. This guy at a Halloween party I was at was dressed in a giant bacon costume. Some girl was yelling at him for being so offensive toward those who didn't eat bacon. For various reasons. Mind you, she ate pork. One of the guys who didn't eat bacon at the party asked her what the heck she was talking about, but she didn't back down. Lol. I have no idea why people feel they need to go out of their way to be inaccurately offended on behalf of other people. 5. One time someone got offended when I put on my seatbelt. She thought I was commenting on Her ability to drive. The same thing happened to me when inside a taxi, he asked, do you wear your seatbelt when you're with your dad? I said, yes. Six. My seven month old was wearing a shirt that had a rocket ship and the NASA logo. And some middle aged woman in the shop said he shouldn't be wearing that because he's clearly not an astronaut. I was dumbfounded. 7 at school, someone didn't have a calculator and asked if anyone had one they could borrow. Someone offered them a pink calculator and they refused, saying that they were offended. They try and give them something less masculine. Clearly they didn't need a calculator that badly if they're just gonna whine about the color. Eight. I'm a nurse at a children's hospital. I was wearing Mickey Mouse Halloween scrubs, which have little dancing skeletons on it. A visitor for one of my patients complained that I was wearing scary and inappropriate scrubs. Nine. People get very offended that I don't like being touched, and this happened just last week. I work at a bank in an affluent part of Atlanta, and a woman called in to let us know she was offended by the security questions for her online banking. The security questions she set up herself. 11. Wearing a mask in public.

He was always showing up in places she would be or randomly showing up at her house with no good intentions. She asked me not to get involved, so I respected her wishes for a while. he tried to break into her home one night while everyone was asleep. He got caught, made a run for it and keyed her car on the way out. Shortly after it happened, I was informed by a witness to the events. The witness expressed to me that at that time they were scared because they knew the ex boyfriend had been physically aggressive in the past and had recently tried to do it again as well. My girlfriend called me that night also but told me it was okay now and not to worry. For the next week, I staked out her house at night in case he tried again. I also found out where he lived and hung out and his routes to such places. I observed him and tracked his schedule. I waited for him to try something again and he came back to try and break in. Added security measures prevented him and after trying other ways, he left. He rode his bike down an isolated dirt path every morning as a shortcut to work. I waited and when I saw him, I blocked off his path with my vehicle. I did what? Had to be done and destroyed his bike. I told him if he even came near her again, even by accident, he wasn't going to walk away from it. An empty threat. I would have just roughed him up more at best. I also told him I recorded him trying to break into her house and damaging her property. I also read out to him in explicit detail his schedule and routines. I told him if I even thought he was sniffing around her again, I would find him. We never heard or saw from him again. We have been together for nearly 2 decades now. Very happy, successful and much so in love still. I swear I'm not a psycho, lol. I'm not possessive or an aggressive person. Everyone calls me a big teddy bear or a big softie. I grew up in a home with that kind of behavior and have zero tolerance for any of it. 2. Every time we go into a restaurant or place of business, I make sure to identify all the exit points in case something bad were to happen. Also never have my back to the doors. 3. I pretend to be asleep when he wakes up because I love how sweetly he wakes me up. 4. That I knew he was planning to propose to me, but I still acted surprised. We've been married 14 years now, but I still haven't told him. He is so proud of the idea that He managed to surprise me. 5. That I know their Reddit account. 6. That her mom called for her the moment before she passed when her mom was passing. She was in the room with her for almost 24 hours straight and left for 30 seconds and I was there in those 30 seconds. Her mother passed, but not before calling for my wife. I don't know if it will haunt her or not, but I just don't think it's something she needs to know. 7. He does not know that he was my teenage crush since I was 12 and I wrote so many beautiful poems about him. We have been married for six years and have a child together. I don't know if I will ever have the courage to tell him that I have always loved him. 8. That I have a folder of photos on my computer called Places I Have Found My Wife Shoes that is legitimately filled with thousands of pictures of my wife shoes that are neither in the closet or shoe rack. 9. That she's my partner. We rent together, go on dates, laugh together, cook together, eat together and talk about each other's day every evening. But she doesn't want a relationship right now. Before anyone says anything, I know how it sounds and I'm slowly making my way out of the situation. 10. Out of grocery shop efficiently. I can't stand going into the grocery store with her. She makes A list and then follows the list order through the store back and forth. She visits the same aisle three to four times.

One. I once needed a pen. Figured this was a reasonable ask, went to the supply closet on my floor, which was locked. Asked the floors admin, and she told me to go to the main supply room in the basement. I went to the basement and explained my situation of needing a pen. They told me all requests for supplies must be approved by my department head. The problem is, being new, I'd never met my department head. She also worked in San Francisco. I worked in Milwaukee, so I needed to send an email both introducing myself and asking her if I had permission to get a pen from the supply closet. 2. All the extra toilet paper in the building has to stay in a single closet, where it can be overseen by the toilet paper queen. I heard her shrieking the other day when she discovered someone had hoarded one spare roll of toilet paper upstairs so the people who work upstairs wouldn't have to walk down multiple flights of stairs when the toilet paper ran out. It's the cheapest one ply toilet paper available on the giant rolls that only fit in the special dispensers. I can't imagine anyone wanting to steal it. Three. A rule that said if you have time to lean, you have time to clean. Which fairly obviously meant if there was no work, then you should be cleaning things. It Was at an aircraft servicing station that was fairly small, but we needed a crew of at least three people for larger planes. The problem was that sometimes there were just no planes, so there was no work. We would clean for a couple of hours and then just run out of stuff to clean. But according to management, that was no good. We had to be busy. It got to be that we would fight over work when it came in, because everyone was so bored. And finding pretend busy work was much harder than just working. I remember getting the crew together to pick up pebbles off the taxiway for a couple hours. There's an old joke in aviation. Go sweep the taxiway. So we actually did it. Four. I drive LA. The company handbook says you're never allowed to back up, ever. You absolutely cannot do the job without reversing. It's impossible. It's in there because of liability in our insurance policy. This way, it can always be the valet's fault if an accident occurs. Ever. The rule only exists to cover the company's rear. Five. When I was in the military, I saw a buddy of mine sitting outside crying. I went and consoled him as best as I could. Apparently, he was just unhappy. After he was feeling a bit better, I went to go and find someone to tell them what was happening. They knew. In fact, he had been crying so much lately, That they had instituted a no crying at your desk policy, which is why he was outside. 6. Empty inbox my boss was an inbox enforcer. Like if you had old emails in there he would flip and make you respond to them or delete them. Apparently you shouldn't have anything left at the end of the day. Deal with them or delete them. Jokes on him though, I just made a subfolder marked personal and everything went in there. 7. My workplace doesn't let you use the word problems. Instead we have to say challenges if something is wrong, as a problem is a negative word and challenges promotes the fact that there is room to fix said problem. 8. I used to work at a place in which my boss implemented a no more than two glasses a day water policy. I ignored this rule and complained directly to our CEO and the matter ended later that day. Nine. Can't have my hands in my pockets. 10. Business casual dress code. Even when I work at home they video call me to check. 11. No one can go to lunch between 12 and 2.

My first few months as a 9 1 1 operator were scary, but nothing could have prepared me for when I got a call late at night from a young girl. I could barely understand what she was saying through her sobbing, but she told me she had just swallowed an entire bottle of pills and just wanted someone to talk to before they did anything. I started asking her why she would do that and asked for her address. She thought I already had it. But after a few minutes, she finally told me where she lived. She said she was severely depressed and just wanted everything to end. I asked her why, just trying to keep her on the phone and she said she couldn't take the hate she was getting anymore. I knew I only had literal minutes to do something and tried talking her into throwing up. She told me no. So I asked her what kind of hate she was getting. Apparently, she just wanted people to like her and wanted to help people. She was getting a lot of hate comments on TikTok and even people in real life. Then it all clicked. I knew I recognized her voice and I actually knew who she was. After a few minutes, I asked her if she was who I thought and she was really surprised. I started to tell her how one of her Videos actually changed my life and got me out of a toxic relationship. She knew I wasn't lying because I told her all about it. I asked her one more time and she finally agreed to try and make herself throw up. She was unconscious when the paramedics got there, but because of that, she was still alive. She now has millions of followers and I'm glad to see her much happier today.

When my son was in the third grade, he was a bully. We tried everything, but he kept constantly getting in trouble and sent to the office. He was known throughout the school for tying balloons to the class rabbit and almost letting it float away. I was leaving work to go get him and as my phone rang, I already knew who it was. I had a special ringtone for his teacher because she called me so much just so I could prepare to hear what he did. She was crying when I answered and I knew it was bad. I told her I was on the way, but instead of getting upset, she started to thank me. I was really confused and she started to talk about what a sweet boy I raised. Literally nobody had ever told me that before for. And I asked what happened. Apparently another kid who didn't have a lot of friends was in his class and his mom had handed out birthday invitations to everyone the day before. Right before the bell went off, he stood up in front of everyone and asked who was coming to his party. The entire class was now silent and he just stood there looking around for someone to tell him they were going. Nobody was saying anything. And she said she could see the kids heart literally breaking in Real time. Then, as he went to sit back down in shame, my son stood up and said, I'm gonna come. I'll be there. His face lit up, and one by one, all the other boys in the class followed his lead and also started telling him they'd come, too. He was trying not to cry when we showed up that weekend.

Except one morning our entire class could hear her outside the room getting chewed out by our assistant principal for being late on grading. We also knew she had lost her sister the week before, so she was having a really rough time. A few minutes into teaching, she started explaining something about our final exam and the guys next to me were passing notes. They usually did it every time she turned around, but this time she saw them. She usually wouldn't have cared, but she thought it was something about her. So she walked over and asked to see it. Kid shook his head without saying anything. So she basically reached into his pocket to grab the note. She started reading it in front of the class and said, I left it in the garbage bin in room W12. It's all there with the. And stopped herself before reading the rest out loud. She looked down at the boy, clearly having read something bad and didn't know what to say. Her face was pale and not knowing what to do. She grabbed them both and literally yanked them out of the room. We all sat there confused for a half hour wondering what that note said. There were police at our school and they asked our whole route to come to the office. They questioned everybody about It, but nobody knew anything. And by the time they let us go, they had sent everybody home. We later found out that the note said there was a key to the office in that garbage bin along with a loaded gun. Both of them denied writing it and said they didn't know who it was for. So they decided to fire our teacher for creating a school wide panic and expelled our entire row.

A few students decided to play a senior prank on the principal by writing on his car. And it made him so mad he decided to cancel the entire prom for the year. Everyone was pissed. So at the homecoming game the week after, we were chanting to bring it back. Eventually at the end, some kid with a banana suit jumped over the bleachers and ran across the field. Everyone screamed as he was being chased by coaches and teachers, and even the players loved it. Eventually, they tackled him hard and he ended up breaking his arm and had to go to the hospital. They had to cancel the game and the staff were so mad they suspended him for the rest of the year. He was probably gonna get expelled, but the students loved him so much, they decided they were gonna do something about it. That day, free Banana Man was born and everyone started chanting it in the halls. Few guys sold t shirts that said it and they wrote it all over the walls. At our school, there were bananas everywhere. And this made our principal so mad, he banned the phrase entirely. However, he didn't just stop there. He decided to go as far as to ban the actual fruit itself and even the entire color yellow. You literally weren't allowed to wear yellow to school. And if you were caught eating A banana, you were sent home for the day. This rule made the entire student body so furious they pretty much declared a war on the administration. Hundreds of students were getting sent home because they decided to bring bananas and wear yellow. And when they tell them to take their yellow shirts off, they'd walk around shirtless to class. I even saw a guy come to school in all yellow, and when they made him take it off, he tried to go to class only in his underwear, which was also yellow. It got so crazy that one kid who literally needed to eat bananas for the potassium couldn't for the week and ended up passing out in the middle of class.

She told me to go to the nurse and on the way there, I started getting, see, I made it there, could feel myself starting to pass out. The nurse called 9 1 1 and I had to go to the hospital.

I taught 5th grade for a few years and had to stay up really late one night to grade some essays. I was exhausted, but I remember reading one of them and couldn't believe what I saw. I told my class to write about a funny story, and this girl, Kelly, wrote about how her mom had almost killed her. She said her mom woke her and her brothers up one morning yelling at them because someone ate a candy from her room. All of them denied it, so they had to stand in a corner until one of them admitted they had eaten it. After an hour, nobody said anything. So their mom stepped it up. She was determined to find who did it, so she made all of them drink an entire cup of salt water until they vomited. She said her throat hurt so much she started crying. I couldn't believe I was reading this and thought she had to have been making it up. I knew her mom and she seemed so nice. She said whoever ate it would have to sleep outside that night. And when she was about to get another glass of salt water, her brother stepped up. He said he took it and her mom was furious. She was literally moving his bed outside. But as she did, their dad came home and had no idea what was going on when He found out it was because of the candy. He told them he was the one who ate it. This was supposed to be her funny story. This girl was 9 and there was no way she was making this up. I couldn't just go to bed. So I called and woke our student advisor up and read her essay word for word over the phone. She, too, didn't believe it was real. So we asked her about it the next day at school. Apparently she just thought it was a funny story and didn't think her mom was being too mean. We had to report. But as soon as someone went out to talk to her parents, she took her daughter out of the school. I hope she's doing okay. Update. I just saw her on the news. She was arrested and put in jail last night.

At first, we tried writing backwards so if teachers or classmates tried to peek, they couldn't read it quickly. But then we realized if our notebooks ever got confiscated, it would still be easy to figure out. So we went full spy mode. We created a whole alphabet, gave each letter its own symbol, and memorized it. Suddenly, we could write full conversations in class, and no one had a clue what we were saying. Bye, high school. We didn't really use it anymore, but I still had all the symbols memorized. One day, I was in class journaling about a crush in the back of my notebook. I wasn't disrupting anyone, but my teacher noticed how into it I was and decided to call me out. He goes, what, are you writing a book over there? Clearly those aren't notes. I froze, snapped the notebook shut immediately. Thankfully, he just made a little joke and moved on. But there was no way I was about to risk my thoughts about this girl being read out loud to the whole class. So the next time I journaled, I switched back. Back to the secret language. To everyone else, it looked like I was just doodling random symbols, but to me, it was the perfect cover. Fast forward. Years later, I find those old notebooks again. And the problem. I had thrown away the Only translator we ever made. Which means all the secrets I wrote as a kid are now locked away forever. In a language even I don't understand anymore. Guys, what do I do?

So my husband Jake has this obsession with sweet tea. Not just any sweet tea, his grandmother's recipe that he makes every single Sunday in this massive gallon pitcher. He uses like 2 cups of sugar, which is disgusting if you ask me. But whatever. The man drinks it all week long and god forbid anyone else touches it. I'm talking about a grown man who literally wrote his name on the picture with a Sharpie. Now, here's where it gets weird. Jake works construction and every morning he fills up this be up old thermos with his precious tea. But here's the thing, he never actually drinks it at work, never. He just carries it around like some kind of security blanket, brings home still full every single day. I thought this was just some quirky habit until last Tuesday when I was doing laundry and found his work shirt absolutely reeking of alcohol. Not beer smell, not wine, straight up vodka. And this wasn't the first time. I've been finding these shirts for weeks. But I kept making excuses. Maybe someone spilled something on him. Maybe he walked past a bar. Stupid stuff like that. So Wednesday morning, I decided to follow him to work. I know how that sounds, but I had to know what was going on. I parked across the street from his job site and watched him for like 20 minutes. The guy pulls out. His thermos unscrews the top, pours out all the sweet tea onto the ground, and then pulls out a bottle of vodka from his lunch box and fills the whole thing up. I sat there in my car just staring. My husband of eight years was day drinking at work. You sing his grandmother's sweet tea recipe as a cover story. The same man who lectured me about having a glass of wine with dinner because someone needs to be responsible in this house. But wait, it gets worse. That night at dinner, he's going on and on about how hard work was, how his back hurts, how his boss is being unreasonable. Meanwhile, I'm looking at him knowing he spent the day sipping vodka out of a thermos while operating heavy machinery. The guy was literally putting people's lives at risk. I didn't say anything that night because I was still processing it. But Thursday morning, same thing. Friday, same thing. By this point, I'm wondering how long this has been going on and how I never noticed. Then I remembered all those times he came home exhausted and went straight to bed at like seven PM all those weekends he was too tired to do any. The man wasn't tired. He was hungover. Sunday comes around and here he is making his weekly batch of sweet tea, humming to himself like nothing's wrong. He's going on about how his grandmother would be so proud that he kept the Tradition alive, how it's the one thing that gets him through the work week. I'm standing there watching him stir in cup after cup of sugar, knowing full well that this, he is just going to end up on the ground while he fills that thermos with vodka. That's when I snapped. The second he went upstairs to shower, I grabbed that pitcher and poured every last drop down the kitchen.

Every Sunday for 15 years, my grandmother made the same announcement at family dinner. When I pass away, everything goes to whoever visits me most. She tap her cane on the floor and smile like she just revealed state secrets. This turned my entire extended family into vultures. My Aunt Rachel drove three hours every Tuesday I just to vacuum Grandma's living room. Uncle Steve called twice daily asking about her arthritis. My cousin Jennifer moved back from California and started doing Grandma's grocery shopping. They all hated each other but pretended to be saints around her. Meanwhile, I was banned from inheritance discussions. I liked guys chicken nuggets and grandma made it crystal clear that sinners don't deserve family money. She changed the subject. Whenever I entered rooms, my cousins would smirk and whisper about how I'd be working at McDonald's while they lived in luxury. But here's what none of them knew. I actually loved spending time with grandma. Not for money, she'd already told me I wasn't getting any, but because she was genuinely funny. When she wasn't performing for the Inheritance Hunters, while they argued over who deserved what, I'd sneak over on Wednesday nights to watch old movies and eat ice cream. Grandma would relax completely. When it was just us, she'd tell dinosaurs jokes from the two thousand BC and complain about how fake everyone was being. She even started Asking about my boyfriend and seemed genuinely interested in our relationship. I never mentioned these visits to anyone because I knew they'd think I was gaming. After she passed last year, the whole family gathered for the will reading. Rachel brought a calculator. Steve wore his funeral suit from 1995. Jennifer had already started planning her European vacation. They were practically drooling as the lawyer opened the envelope.

My boyfriend Jake had been the same couch potato for three years. The guy who needed me to open pickle jars was suddenly doing push UPS at 6:00am. When I asked what sparked this change, he just shrugged and said he wanted to get healthy, but something felt wrong. It start started small. He bought protein powder and left it on the kitchen counter like some kind of trophy. Then he got a gym membership to this fancy place across town instead of the Planet Fitness two blocks away. When I suggested we work out together, he got weird and said he preferred going alone to focus. The red flags kept piling up. He started showering immediately after coming home from the gym, which seemed normal until I realized he never smelled like sweat. His gym clothes were always perfectly clean, too. One day I decided to surprise him with lunch at his gym. The guy at the front desk looked confused when I asked for Jake. Turns out he hadn't been there in weeks. I confronted him that night. He got defensive and said he switched gyms because the other one was too crowded. When I asked which gym, he stuttered and said some random name I'd never heard of. That's when I knew he was lying. So I did what any suspicious girlfriend would do. I followed him the next Tuesday I watched him drive past three different gyms and pull into the parking lot of a Starbucks. Through the window I saw him sitting across from this blonde girl who definitely wasn't just a workout buddy. She was laughing at everything he said and touching his arm constantly. My heart was pounding as I watched them for 20 minutes. When she got up to leave, he grabbed her hand and kissed it. I wanted to storm in there and cause a scene, but instead I waited. He came home an hour later with this fake exhausted look, complaining about how intense his workout was. I played along for two more weeks, watching him lie to my face every single day. He even started buying workout supplements and leaving them around the apartment as props. The worst part was when he'd flex his non existent new muscles and ask if I noticed any changes and I got clever. I told him my friend Emma was looking for a new gym and asked for his recommendation. He panicked and said his gym was full and not taking new members. When I offered to call and check, he quickly said they had a waiting list and it wouldn't be worth it. That weekend Jake said he was going to a special Saturday morning workout class. Instead, I followed him to the same Starbucks. This time they were holding hands across the table and looking at something on her phone together when he Leaned over and kissed her forehead. I knew I had enough evidence, but I didn't confront him yet. I had a better plan. I went home and researched the girl on social media. Found her Instagram through the Starbucks location tag. Her name was Ashley, and according to her posts, she'd been seeing someone new for the past month. The timeline matched perfectly with Jake's and fitness obsession. Monday night, I casually mentioned

My phone buzzed at 2:00am with a text that made me sit straight up in bed. Remember that favor you owe me? I need you to be my boyfriend at my sister's wedding this Saturday. Pick me up at four PM wear navy. It was from Poppy, the girl who saved my entire college career three years ago. I hadn't spoken to her since graduation when I drunkenly promised her anything, anytime, after she spent an entire semester tutoring me through chemistry for free. Without her, I would have lost my scholarship and dropped out. Now she was calling in that favor and honestly, being someone's fake boyfriend for a day seemed like a small price to pay. Plus, if I was being honest with myself, I'd always wondered what it would have been like to actually date. When I picked her up that Saturday, Poppy answered the door looking absolutely stunning in an emerald dress that made her green eyes even brighter. But her expression was all business. She handed me a typed sheet of paper titled Our Relationship Details with bullet points about our first date, how long we've been together and my supposed favourite things about her. Eight months, she said, adjusting my tie without making eye contact. We've been dating eight months. You call me pop sometimes. We met at a coffee shop. Her voice was mechanical like she was reading a grocery list. During the drive, she explained The situation, my parents keep trying to set me up with their business partner's son at every family event. He's perfectly nice, but I'm just not interested. This will shut them up for a while. The whole ride, she was silent. Then when we arrived at the venue, she took a deep breath, grabbed my hand and suddenly transformed into a completely different person. Ready, babe, she said with a bright smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. The ceremony was beautiful. I caught Poppy wiping her eyes during the vows and without thinking, I handed her my pocket square. She looked surprised but took it, whispering thanks so quietly, I almost missed it. During the reception, I found myself forgetting this was an act. When her uncle made a toast, I instinctively put my arm around her shoulders. When the music was too loud to hear her cousin's story, I leaned down so she could whisper it in my ear, her breath warm against my neck. Her grandmother cornered us by the dessert table, pinching my cheeks and telling Poppy in a stage whisper, this one's much better than Adrian. Poppy went rigid at the name, but I squeezed her hand and smoothly changed the subject to Grandma's famous apple pie recipe. The couple's dance was when everything shifted. Poppy was stiff in my arms, counting steps under her breath like she was solving an equation. Hey, I whispered, pulling her closer. Just follow me. Stop thinking so hard. She looked up at me and for a moment, her guard completely dropped. She melted into me, her head finding that perfect spot against my shoulder. We swayed together as the song played and I found myself hoping it would never end. Then during the bouquet toss, she caught it by accident when it bounced off another girl's hands, the crowd cheered, but Poppy immediately handed it to the girl beside her, laughing it off. Just superstition anyway, she said. But I noticed her looking at the flowers longingly as the other girl walked away. Her sister pulled me aside while Poppy was in the bathroom. Thank you, she said, squeezing my arm for making her happy, if it's just for tonight. The words stuck with me. As the night wound down, I realized I wasn't acting anymore. When I looked at her laughing with her cousins, I felt a pull in my chest that had nothing to do with owing her a favor, driving her home. I couldn't keep it in anymore. Poppy, I know this was just repaying a debt, but tonight felt real to me, really real. She went completely still in the passenger seat when I pulled up to her apartment. She practically jumped out of the car. You did great. Perfect. Fake boyfriend. We're even now. The words came out rushed and cold. She was already at her building's door before I could respond. I sat there for five minutes feeling like an idiot before Driving home the next morning, Poppy's sister texted me, you left your.

My sister called me a bad mom until her kid told me the truth. When Emma asked if she could dye her hair blue for her 13th birthday, I said, sure, it's just hair, right? She'd been begging me for weeks, showing me Pinterest photos of these gorgeous ocean blue highlights. Target. We picked out some semi permanent dye that would wash out in a month. She was so excited she could barely sit still while I painted the streaks in our tiny bathroom. The next morning at breakfast, she kept flipping her hair and grinning at herself in the toaster reflection. I made her favourite blueberry pancakes and she kept saying how the blue and her hair match the berries perfectly. honestly the happiest I'd seen her since her dad moved out last year. But when we showed up at my sister Beth's house for Sunday dinner, everything went sideways fast. Beth took one look at Emma and her face just dropped. She pulled me into the kitchen while Emma was playing with her cousins and started going off about how irresponsible I was being. What kind of message does this send, she whispered harshly, gesturing toward the living room. She's going to look like some delinquent at school. I tried explaining it was just temporary hair dye, that Emma was still getting straight A's and playing violin. But Beth wouldn't hear it. She kept shaking her head and muttering about how I was clearly struggling as a single mom and needed to set better boundaries. The whole dinner was awkward after that with Beth making passive aggressive comments about certain parenting choices every time Emma's hair caught the light. When we got home that night, Emma seemed deflated. She kept touching her hair and asking if I thought it looked stupid. I reassured her it looked amazing, but I could tell Beth's reaction had gotten to her. That's when I decided to call my mom to vent about the whole thing. Mom listened patiently while I ranted about Beth being judgmental. Then she got quiet for a moment. Honey, she said carefully, there's something you should probably know about your sister's situation. Apparently, Beth had been calling.

So my brother Jake got married, like, three weeks ago, and the whole thing was basically a slap in the face. His wife Megan, decided nobody under 21 could come because they were serving alcohol and didn't want any minors getting drunk. I was 19 at the time, which apparently made me some kind of liability. The excuse was complete bullshit, and everyone knew it. I don't even drink that much. Maybe a beer here and there with friends, but I'm not some alcoholic teenager who's gonna embarrass their precious wedding. But whatever. That's what they decided, and my parents just went along with it, like always. I asked them to reconsider a few times because, honestly, it hurt. Jake and I used to be close growing up. Shared a room until I was 14, played video games together, the whole thing. But ever since he started dating Megan two years ago, she's basically been calling all the shots. She thinks she's better than everyone because her dad owns some car dealership and she went to private school. After they kept saying no, I just stopped caring. If I wasn't good enough for their wedding, then fine. I wasn't gonna beg anymore. Then last Saturday rolls around, and Jake, our family group chat, saying he wants everyone to go to some fancy steakhouse to celebrate the wedding. My parents were all Excited, talking about how nice it would be to finally celebrate as a family. But I just replied that I wasn't going. My mom called me right away asking why not? I told her the same thing I told everyone else. I didn't see the point in celebrating something I wasn't even invited to. She tried to guilt trip me, saying it would mean a lot to Jake and that my cousins Becca and Tyler were going even though they didn't get invited either. But here's the thing. Becca is 13 and Tyler is 15. Their parents literally forced them to go. They didn't have a choice. I'm 19, I pay my own phone Bill, I work at Best Buy part time, and I'm starting community college in the fall. I can make my own decisions about where I spend my Saturday night. My parents kept trying to convince me all week. My dad even offered to pay for my meal, which honestly just made it worse. Like, you couldn't fight for me to be at the actual wedding, but now you wanna throw money at me to show up to the Celebration dinner? The night of the dinner, I stayed home and ordered pizza. I was playing call of duty with my friends when my phone started blowing up. First it was Jake texting me asking where I was, and Megan sent me this long paragraph about how disappointed she was that I couldn't be mature enough to support my Brother's happiness. The funniest part is they acted all surprised that I didn't show up. I literally told them I wasn't going. What did they expect? After they got home from dinner, Jake came to my room and tried to have some

Like it was an achievement for everybody except for you. And they always say, yeah, I just never really Learned how to. Bro, you had years. What were you doing while the rest of us were outside with scraped knees and helmets too big for our heads? Like, be honest, you can't balance. It's basically walking but with handles. The bike does have to work for you. All you gotta do is not fall over. And don't give me, the bikes were never my thing. Excuse. What does that even mean? Breathing is not my thing either. But here I am doing it every day. I swear, if we ever go on a group ride and you say, I'll meet you there, I better not catch you on a rental e scooter. You trust that wobbly plank with a motor more than a bike? Be serious. You missed out on one of the best childhood feelings, that breeze hitting your face when you're speeding down a hill, feeling like you own the world. Riding a bike isn't just a skill, it's a universal experience. You skipped a childhood achievement. Yeah, but hey, it's not too late to learn. Trust me.

I bought new jeans that actually fit.

He was literally in front of his wife and kids when a bullet entered his artery through his neck. The scene was so bloody and gruesome, it's insane. A Ukrainian girl gets stabbed on a train in Charlotte. She escaped a literal war, came here to be safe and still got killed because this planet has zero peace.

It's easier that way, isn't it? People see the smile and assume everything is fine. No awkward questions, no forced explanations, no pity looks, just normal. Because explaining how you really feel, that takes energy you simply don't have. And truth be told, not everyone understands. So you wear the smile like armor, convincing the world that you're okay. But deep down, you're tired. Carrying invisible weights that no one sees, navigating battles that don't show on the surface. And still you keep smiling. Not because you're happy, but because sometimes it's the only way to make it through the day. But here's the truth. You don't always have to smile through it. It's okay to let someone in, even if it's just one person. Sometimes talking won't fix everything, but it can lighten the load. Just enough to breathe again. And that. That's a start.

When my sister Amanda decides she wants attention, she'll claw it out of someone else's skin if she has to. At family gatherings, she was the one who'd loudly announce my bad grades, failed driving test, or awkward crushes to get a cheap laugh. I always took it because that's just Amanda, but she crossed the line. Last month I woke up to 30 notifications on Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. My phone was blowing up with laughing emojis, L M A O s, and tags. Turns out Amanda dug into old photo albums and posted my most humiliating pictures. Me with braces and acne. Me dressed as a clown for Halloween at 12. Me crying at my middle school graduation because my speech went wrong. Captioned some people never grow out of being pathetic. She tagged me in every single one. At first I was mortified. I got DMs from co workers, college friends, even my boss, all seeing my sister publicly roast me like I was still a kid. I called her immediately. Delete them, I said. She laughed into the phone. Relax, it's just for fun. Everyone thinks it's hilarious. You humiliated me in front of everyone I know. Oh, come on, she sneered. You've always been the boring one. Let me have a little fun. It's not like you have a reputation to ruin. That last line hit hard and something in me snapped. Amanda has always painted herself as the golden child, but I knew things about her that she didn't want public things buried in county court records. Things her husband's family had no idea about. I opened my laptop and went digging. It didn't take long to find exactly what I was looking for. Amanda's shoplifting arrest from six years ago. She had been caught stealing makeup and jewelry from a department store. She avoided jail time, but had to pay fines and attend a petty theft class. It was all public record, just forgotten. And then there was her DUI from three years ago, the one mom begged me not to tell anyone about. Amanda had spent a night in jail, had her license suspended for a year, and attended mandatory AA meetings. Both cases public record. She wanted to play dirty. Fine. The next evening, I made a post on Facebook. Simple.

I think back to when my sister held my hand through our dad's death when we were 16. She's been there through my depression, my divorce from my first marriage, everything. She chose me as her birth partner months ago when her boyfriend bailed. My wife texts, contractions five minutes apart now. Then I'm scared, too. Then we promised We'd do this together. My wife has an anxiety disorder and she's been planning this birth for three years. Made a playlist, wrote letters to the baby. We practice breathing exercises every night. I'm driving when my breathing starts coming in faster and my hands are shaking so bad, I swerve into the other lane. A truck horn blares and I yank the wheel back, nearly going off the road. I have to pull over on the highway shoulder just so I can gasp for air. Full panic attack, head and hands on the steering wheel trying to breathe. My phone explodes with calls. I answer them one by one. My mother in law is screaming, we just got to the hospital. Where are you? How dare you leave her right now? My father in law texts, get back here now. Man up and support your family. Then my mom calls, we're getting on a plane but that's five hours away. You need to step up as her big brother. Your sister has nobody. The baby might not survive. My dad texts, blood comes first. Your wife has family, your sister has no one. I sit there for a moment longer, breathing. Then I call both hospitals. My sister's nurse says she's asking for you. She's terrified. My wife's nurse told me she's progressing fast. Where are you? My phone's at 5% battery from all the calls at this point. The last thing I hear is my mother in law. Saying, if you're not here when that baby comes, don't bother coming home. My phone dies right there in my hands, still vibrating with another call coming in. I choose to go to my sister because she's alone and at higher risk. I speed toward her hospital, crying the whole way. I run into the emergency room, asking for her delivery room. The nurse looks confused.

There's no hate about being plus size. In fact, I think everybody is beautiful no matter. some of these self centered influencers don't seem to think the same. If you know you have a plus size body, which is perfectly fine if you're healthy, you cannot go into a store like Brandy Melville, which is a store specifically made for petite sizes and teenagers. Especially since they only have one size and expect their clothes to fit you. And then you go online to tell the whole world to hate on Brandy Melville because their petite sizes couldn't fit you. And I think y'all know who I'm talking about. News flash there's different body types besides plus size that need to have accommodations to their clothes to fit them. Brandy Melville is one of the stores that provide accommodations for petite sizes. It's the same thing as a skinny woman going into a store specifically made for plus size people like Taylor or Lane Bryant and complaining on the internet that the clothes are too baggy on them. Like what did you expect? Not everything is going to accommodate to you, whether your ego believes it or not. So no, if you are not petite or close to that body type, you are most likely not going to be able to fit into petite size clothes. Which is actually pretty obvious. Oh boy, you really solved the case this time, didn't ya Sherlock? Maybe next time Enola will guide us towards the common sense. That's not even the bad part. The bad part is that the bickering has actually worked. There has been a noticeable increase of Brandy Melville's one size clothes are too big on the ones who actually need them to be small. And notice how I'm only talking about Brandy Melville. That's because it's the only store that actually has trendy and style affordable and cute clothing for petite women. The unreasonable hate is taking that away from girlies who actually need it. We need inclusivity! All bodies are beautiful. Until it's skinny women anyways. Who's a spray 6 9 O U T ho ho ho!

The daycare called me at work saying Alara had been inconsolable for two hours. This wasn't normal. Alar was the easiest baby ever. Never fussed unless something was seriously wrong. In her eight months of life, she'd only had maybe three real crying episodes. Once when she had an ear infection, once when she fell and bumped her head, and once when she had a stomach bug. Each time, I could calm her down within minutes just by holding her. But according to the daycare worker on the phone, nothing was working. They'd tried feeding her, changing her, rocking her, even putting her in the swing she usually loved. The woman sounded frazzled, almost annoyed. She's disrupting the other children, she said. Maybe you should come get her early today. I asked if I could talk to Miss Caren, the head caregiver, who Alara absolutely adored. Alara would light up every morning when she saw Miss Caren's face. But the woman said Miss Caren was busy with the other kids. Something about that phone call bothered me. The entire drive over, the daycare worker hadn't sounded concerned, just irritated. Like Alara crying was more of an inconvenience than something to worry about. I've been using Sunshine Daycare for six months, ever since I went back to work. It came highly recommended, had great reviews online, and Miss Karin seemed to genuinely care about all The kids. She'd send me photos throughout the day of Alara playing and smiling. She remembered details about Alara's routine, her favorite toys, even the face she made when she didn't like her food. I trusted this place completely. When I told my boss I had to leave for a family emergency, he didn't question. I grabbed my keys and practically ran to the parking garage. The entire 15 minute drive, I kept trying to think of what could be wrong. Maybe Alara was getting sick and I just hadn't noticed the signs this morning. Maybe she was having a growth spurt and needed more food. Maybe she missed me more than usual today. But deep down, something felt off. Alara had never been described as in consolable by anyone, ever. Even my mother in law, who had strong opinions about everything, always commented on how calm and happy Alara was. When I pulled into the daycare parking lot, I immediate we knew something was wrong. I could hear crying from the parking lot. Not just Alara, but multiple babies screaming. It sounded like chaos inside. In all the months I've been dropping Alara off and picking her up, I'd never heard anything like this. Usually there might be one child fussing here and there, but this sounded like every baby in the place was upset. I walked up to the front entrance and tried the door. Locked. Which was weird because pickup wasn't for another hour and a half. The daycare was supposed to be open until six PM and it was only 4:30. I knocked on the front door and waited. No one came. The crying was getting louder and I could definitely pick out Alara's.

My six year old nephew absolutely destroyed my sister at Thanksgiving dinner. And honestly, she deserved it. My sister Emma has always been obsessed with appearances. Perfect makeup, designer clothes, constantly taking selfies. She's the type who spends two hours getting ready just to go to target. At family dinners, she'd always make these passive aggressive comments about everyone else's life choices. So we're all sitting around the table last Thanksgiving, Emma shows up an hour late because she had to get her nails done. She's wearing this ridiculous white dress to a family dinner where we're eating gravy and cranberry sauce. Classic Emma move. She immediately starts her usual routine. Comments about how mom's stuffing has too much salt this year. Mentions how Uncle Rick should probably lay off the dinner rolls. Makes this big show of only eating tiny portions because she's watching her figure. Then she turns to my brother Jake, who just started community college. So, Jake, still taking those little classes? When are you going to get a real degree? Jake just stared at his plate. The kids working two jobs to pay for school. Emma kept going. She asked my cousin about her starter apartment and wondered when she'd get a grown up job. She even made a comment about dad's old truck in the driveway, saying it was embarrassing. The whole time, my nephew Tyler was just sitting there eating his Turkey And watching Tyler's Jake's six year old son. Super quiet kid, usually just plays with his food and doesn't say much during adult conversations. Emma was on roll. She started talking about her new boyfriend's BMW and how they're looking at condos downtown. Really laying it on thick about how successful she is compared to everyone else. Then she made her biggest mistake. She looked at Tyler and said, Tyler, sweetie, make sure you study hard in school so you don't end up like your daddy, okay? The table went dead silent. Jake's face turned red. Mom literally gasped. Dad put down his fork and just stared at Emma. But Tyler. Tyler just looked up from his mashed potatoes, blinked those big innocent eyes, and said in the sweetest voice ever, Aunt Emma, why?

Yeah, the number that every little brain rotted kid has been spamming these past few months like it's a sacred ritual to summon the meme god. Turns out this isn't just some random number. There's actually a lore behind it. It all started off with the meme No. 69 way back in 2000, 2,018 to 2,020. Just like 6, 7, kids were always pointing out the No. 69, except this was more immature and freaky. So what does this have to do with 6, 7? You guys remember why 6 is afraid of 7? It's because 7 ate 9. Yeah, after seeing 69 being in the spotlight, 7 got hungry for the same attention and literally ate 9. It then overtook 9 spot and became 6, 7. Now kids are spamming 6, 7 like they're hoping to be blessed with Seven's power. Everything literally makes perfect sense now. Or maybe I just need therapy.

It's only been 11 days and the world is completely off its fucking rocker. Charlie Kirk was killed in front of his family. David was found with a body in his car. A Ukrainian girl was stabbed on the subway. And now Elon Musk isn't even the richest man on the planet anymore. Can we chill for one second? First, Charlie Kurt got shot during a speech in Utah. He was literally in front of his wife and kids when a bullet entered his artery through his neck. The scene was so bloody and gruesome, it's insane. A Ukrainian girl gets stabbed on a train in Charlotte. She escaped a literal war, came here to be safe and still got killed because this planet has zero peace. Then D4D has a whole body in his car, like not a metaphorical one, an actual human body in a bag in his trunk. And this dude just casually performed like he didn't have a horror movie in his backseat. What the hell? And even outside all of that, Elon Musk is no longer the richest person in the world, losing his top spot to a rival tech CEO, showing how unstable everything feels right now, even at the highest levels. It's like every time I open my phone, reality speed runs another tragedy. Like, bro, it's been 11 days. September just started. I thought my only problem this month would be math class, but no, apparently it's Full blown world collapse. Society isn't just cooked, it's burnt to ash. Wakati Huo.

I don't know if anyone else feels this, but it's like I'm never really alone, but I'm never really chosen either. I'm the one people are happy to see in the group, the one they'll talk to if no one else is around, the one that's nice and easy to hang out with. But when it comes down to it, I'm never the person someone calls first. I'm not the best friend, the ride or die, the person they can't wait to text when something happens. I'm just there. Always included, never prioritized. It's such a mind fuck because technically I have friends. I'm not isolated, but I still feel invisible. I'll be standing right there laughing with everyone and still feel like an extra in my own life. Like I'm the supporting character in their story, but never the main one in mine. And yeah, it hurts. It fucking hurts watching everyone else pair off, have their person, while I'm the one left lingering in the background. I'm good enough for everyone, but not special enough for anyone.

There has been a school shooting in Denver. A girl got stabbed on the subway and no one helped her. A decomposing body found in D4V D's car. A man was beheaded at Dallas motel. Charlie Kirk getting shot and killed at a university. And all on top of that, the 9 11 was 24 years ago today. As much as I hate Charlie Kirk and his decisions, no one deserves to get killed. Imagine what his wife and kids are feeling right now. His children can't grow up with their dad. His wife is now a single parent. I genuinely hate Charlie, but I can't imagine how his family is handling this right now. And apparently they witnessed it. The way the blood came out of his neck was genuinely traumatizing. The way his body went limp immediately was horrifying. But anyways, moving on to the D4 V D situation. He's been on tour for like what, a month now? He hasn't been in LA for like a month. And the body hadn't decomposed enough for it to be in that car for so long. The body was in there for three days, and the police haven't even made him a suspect. And plus he had a concert like yesterday, I'm pretty sure. But yeah, moving on to the girl that was stabbed. She was literally minding her business before she got stabbed. And as soon as she got stabbed, everyone was So calm. Like, hello, she needs help. There was literal blood dripping on the floor. I don't have much information on the other situations, but the fact that this is all happened in a week is honestly scary. Like, this month has just started. What's going on

September just got even crazier. So it turns out that Charlie Kirk's shooter has just been identified. Life was found on Mars. Nepal actually burn down their government and the Epstein files just got released. Just days ago. Charlie Kirk was shot and killed during a speech at Utah Valley University. The shooter, 22 year old Tyler Robinson has already been identified and arrested. It turns out that his own dad turned him into the police after finding out what a disturbing thing his son has done and he's now facing many charges. Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, Nepal has erupted. Weeks of youth LED protests over corruption and broken promises turned into full blown chaos. Government buildings were torched. The prime minister was forced to resign and the one piece flag was even hung as a symbol of hope. And while all of that was happening, Mars quietly entered the conversation. NASA's rover has detected possible biosignatures, signs that there might have once been ancient life on the planet. It's the closest we've ever come to extraterrestrial life. At the same time, over 33,000 pages of the Jeffrey Epstein files were released to the public. Thousands of names and connections that people are still coming through with some of the world's most powerful figures being linked to him. It's only been 12 days and it already feels like the whole world balance is shifting.

I'm in class, stomach rumbling like a fucking baying whale, and suddenly I'm speed walking to the bathroom. Like I'm in mission impossible, but before I can even shit I gotta play stall roulette. One got a drawing of a mutilated face so detailed it belongs in the Louvre. The next one soaked in piss. Seat, floor, walls, everywhere. Third one literal shit on the seat. Last one no door, just wide open. Like I'm shitting on display at a zoo. So I finally find a stall that's barely functional and the second my cheeks hit the seat, a whole ass festival starts. Some dude walks in like hey Yo, who taking a dump? Bitch, why are you asking that? What do you want me to say? It's me. Now I'm frozen, cheeks spread, heart pounding, trying to be dead silent. Like I'm in a horror movie and the killers right outside. I'm scared to even breathe. My ass clenched harder than the great Beaver Dam. And there's always one guy who won't leave. He's doing his hair, taking mirror selfies, watching Tik Toks on full volume like this bathroom is his Fucking Studio apartment. Meanwhile, I'm in the stall holding in a stinky shirt, about to break through enemy lines when I finally drop one. It echoes through the school like an airstrike. I flush mid shit to hide the sound, but it makes It worse now. It sounds like I'm battling a demon in stall three. Then I walk out. Boom. Eye contact with someone I know. Judgment, disgust. Like I just dropped a war crime in there. And when I sit back down in class, my friend turns around like, I know you just took a massive shit. Like, damn, my bad for having a digestive system that functions, bitch. Follow if you like this video at Top Hat, Man. 32 out.

I hated group projects more than anything in college. Every single time I'd end up doing all the work while everyone else just showed up for the grade. So when Professor Williams assigned our final ethics project worth 30% of our grade, I swore things would be different this time. The professor randomly put me with three students I barely knew, Alex, Jordan and Sam. I was actually excited because maybe working with strangers would mean they'd actually care about their grades. Boy, was I wrong. I made a group chat the same day and sent detailed messages about meeting times, dividing up the work and setting deadlines. Radio silence, tried again the next day, nothing. I even walked up to Alex after class and asked if he got my messages. He just shrugged and said, yeah, we'll figure it out later. Two weeks passed. The 20 page research paper was due in 10 days and nobody had written a single word. I kept sending messages, trying to set up meetings, offering to do video calls. They left me on read every single time. I had a choice. I could let our whole group fail or I could do what I always did. So I spent the next week pulling all nighters, researching corporate ethics scandals, writing analysis after analysis, adding proper citations and references, 23 pages of solid work. I was exhausted but proud when I submitted It online. I only put my name on it, not theirs, just mine. The very next morning, the day before our presentation, my phone started buzzing like crazy. Alex was calling me over and over. When I finally picked up, he sounded panicked. Hey, Maya, we're all ready to present now. Just make sure you add our names back to the title slide before class. Okay? I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Add your names back. You guys didn't help write anything. Come on, don't be like that. We're a team. Just put us on there. I hung up. 20 minutes later, Sam was knocking on my dorm room door acting all friendly like we were best friends. Maya, hey, we just wanna make sure everything's good for tomorrow. We can all present different sections. What sections did you write? I asked. Well, we didn't technically write them, but we can present them. That's basically the same thing, right? I told her no and closed the door. That's when things got ugly. They emailed Professor Williams that same night claiming I had excluded them maliciously from the project and refused to collaborate. They said I was trying to take all the credit for work they had done. They even said I deleted their contributions from the shared document. Professor Williams replied to all of us the next morning. He said there would be a hearing after class where each person would be graded individually based on what they could Prove they contributed. When I walked into the classroom for our presentation, my three group members were already there with printed papers and fake concerned expressions. They had actually printed out what looks like rough drafts with their names on them. During the hearing, they went first. Alex claimed he had written the entire introduction, that I had deleted it and rewritten it in my own words. Jordan said he had researched all the case studies, but I had stolen his work. Sam said she had done the conclusion, but I had cut her out completely. They showed Professor Williams.

Me and my older brother, Nate, were best friends growing up. He was everything I wanted to be. Tough, protective, always getting me out of trouble when I messed up. When I broke Mrs. Wilson's window playing baseball, Nate took the blame and got grounded for two weeks. When I failed my math test, he spent hours helping me study for the retake. We shared everything. Our tiny bedroom, video games, even a fake ID when we got to college. Our parents died in a car crash when I was 15. The whole world felt like it was ending. But Nate stepped up immediately. He was only 22, barely an adult himself, but he became my legal guardian without hesitation. He dropped out of his senior year, got two jobs, working at a warehouse during the day and cleaning offices at night. I never heard him complain once. He'd come home exhausted, covered in sweat and dust, but still help me with homework. When other kids got allowances, Nate made sure I had lunch money. When I wanted new sneakers, he worked overtime to get them. He never made me feel like a burden, even though I knew I was draining every penny he earned. I graduated high school with decent grades and got into State College. Nate was so proud, he cried at my graduation. Said our parents would have been proud, too. He kept working those same two jobs to pay My tuition, living off ramen noodles and hope. I promised him someday I'd pay him back for everything. Four years later, I landed a good job at an accounting firm, finally making real money. First thing I did was try to give Nate Cash, but he refused. Said seeing me succeed was payment enough. That's just how he was. Never wanted anything for himself. Last Thanksgiving, I brought my fiance Emma, home to meet him. She'd heard all my stories about my amazing big brother who raised me. They got along great. Laughing at old photos, Nate telling embarrassing stories about when I was little. Everything felt perfect. Later that night, after Emma went to bed, Nate asked me to sit down. He looked nervous, fidgeting with his coffee cup like he used to do when we were kids. And he had something serious to tell me.

My wife Stephanie waited until we were eating dessert at Cassie and Paul's house to drop this on me. We should swap partners every Thursday, she said, and I literally watched her put her hand on Paul's thigh under the table. I saw it. Cassie saw it, too, and her face went blank. What? I asked because I honestly thought I heard her wrong. Partner swapping. We date each other's spouses. She said it like she was talking about switching cars for the weekend. Paul kept staring at his plate and wouldn't make eye contact with me. It's already decided, Stephanie said. Thursday nights, you take Cassie out, Paul takes me. I felt my chest get tight. When did they decide this without me? This is insane, I told her. Then she leaned in close and whispered, room 2:37 last Tuesday when you were at work. My whole body went numb. She was telling me she'd already cheated and now wanted my permission to keep doing it. So are you in or not? She asked louder. I looked at Cassie, and she was crying without making any sound. Fine, I said. Let's swap partners. Stephanie smiled like she just won something. But then I noticed Cassie had stopped crying completely. That should have told me something right there. When the first date night came around, Stephanie spent forever getting ready. She put on this Red dress I've never seen before that she'd been hiding in our closet. Paul's car was already running in our driveway when I left. I brought Cassie white roses because I remembered she mentioned liking them once. Her hands shook when she took them. Paul? Never. She started, then stopped. At dinner. She pushed her food around and barely ate anything. You okay? I asked. Paul's been different, she said quietly. For months, even before. Then she stopped talking again. I reached over and touched her hand. Before what? Nothing. Forget I said anything. But then her phone lit up with Stephanie's name, and she turned it face down immediately. When I got home that night, Stephanie was already there. Her hair was all messed up and her lipstick was smeared on the wrong side of her mouth. How was Cassie? Good. How was Paul? Then she started telling me everything they did. The hotel room, the balcony, what they did against the wall. Kept getting louder with each detail. Stop, I told her. Why? Don't you wanna know? No. Her face got all twisted up. Well, I'm telling you anyway. She kept going with more details while I pulled out my phone and texted Cassie, thank you for a lovely evening. Stephanie saw my screen and threw her wine glass at the wall. It shattered everywhere, and I just stood there looking at her. The next week, I had to pick Cassie up because her car broke down. Out Of nowhere. Paul was supposed to drive me, she said, looking confused. Forgot at dinner. She had way too much wine. Can I tell you something? She asked, and her eyes looked glassy. Tuesday afternoons. That's when it started. My heart started racing. What started? She covered her mouth with her hand. Nothing. Forget it. But Tuesday was when Stephanie had mentioned the hotel and we both knew what she meant. Then we had to go to Stephanie's parents house for dinner. Stephanie showed up late and I could smell Paul's Cologne all over her clothes. Her mom noticed it right away and her face changed. Is that men's Cologne? The whole table went quiet. We're sharing partners with Cassie and Paul, I said. Every week. Her dad dropped his fork and it made this

My sister Emma had been planning her wedding for two years, and I was supposed to be her maid of honor. She kept dropping hints about how all the bridesmaids needed to look cohesive in the photos and how important it was for everyone to put their best foot forward for her big day. Look, I'm not stupid. I knew what she was getting at. I gained about 40 pounds over the past few years since I started working from home. Emma never said it directly, but every time we talked about the wedding, she'd mention some diet she saw on Instagram or ask if I was getting ready for the wedding season. The breaking point came three months before the wedding, when we went dress shopping. I tried on the bridesmaid dress in my size, and Emma just stared at me in the mirror with this tight smile. She asked if maybe we should size up for comfort, and then suggested I might want to start doing some pre wedding prep with her. That weekend, she texted me a link to some fitness app and said, thought this might help with your confidence for the big day. I screenshot that text and sent it to my boyfriend Tyler, who said she was being a total bitch, but I decided I'd show her. I downloaded my Fitness Pal that night and started tracking everything. I cut out all the late night snacking, stopped. Getting coffee with extra syrup and started walking to the grocery store instead of driving. I wasn't trying to do anything extreme. I just wanted to lose enough weight that Emma couldn't make her little comments anymore. First month, I lost 12 pounds. Emma noticed right away when we met for brunch and kept asking what I was doing differently. I told her I was just eating better, and she got this weird look on her face like she didn't expect me to actually do anything about it. By month two, I was down 25 pounds and feeling amazing. I bought new jeans that actually fit.

More like we are going to a good restaurant. Nice. Anyway, my cousin hits me up saying she has to show me something. It was the picture of the dress. Heather was gonna wear this dress, Jesus Christ. It can only be described as opulent. It was long and white, strapless with sewn in crystals and golden accents. I'm pretty sure it's a wedding dress, but I can't be 100%. This made me really mad. I started texting people telling them that there had been a change of plans and instead of a casual formal, I decided to have a costume. Party. My mother's side is crazy for Halloween, so they were immediately on board. I told my father via text and asked him to relay the message to Heather and her mother, knowing full well that he would forget or leave it to the last minute. Saturday comes along and guests start showing up. Most of them are in costumes and some didn't have time to get one. We just provided them with fun hats and cheap wigs. My fiance was dressed as bubbles and I was dressed as.

Like they're casting a spell? Like, bro, I just sneezed, not summoned a demon. Why did I just get blessed by the entire student council? And it's never normal either. One kids whispering bless you like he's in a horror movie, another kids yelling from the back of the room like it's a military command. There's always that one girl who says bless you like she's singing the national anthem. And the teacher, they just pause and stare like I just committed a federal crime. Like, sorry for having a functioning immune system, Margaret. And here comes Dylan, who only speaks once every six months, saying god bless your soul, bro. Are you my priest now? Don't even think about sneezing twice. Oh no, now you've triggered the second blessing protocol. People start giggling, someone says you good! Like I just came back from war and Kyle in the corner starts clapping like I landed a plane. I still haven't recovered from the last time when they blessed me in three different languages. Someone threw a pencil like it was a ritual offering. Next time I sneeze, I'm leaving the room. Y'all not about to turn me into a classroom event again. Subscribe to this!

Like bro. A bee is a neutral good character. It's just flying around pollinating flowers, minding its own business. It's an NPC on a peaceful side quest. If you don't bother it, it won't bother you. It's just a chill guy. But a wasp. A wasp is chaotic evil. It was created by the universe for the sole purpose of causing problems. It's spawns into the world and chooses violence. It has no mission other than to ruin your day. It doesn't even have a reason. It just wants to see the world burn. And don't even get me started on the sting. A bee stings you as a last resort. A final self destruct move. It's a kamikaze. But a wasp will sting you seven times just because you looked at it wrong. It's not self defense, it's a full blown assault for no reason. A bee is a fuzzy cute little guy. A wasp looks like it was designed in a lab to be the final boss of all insects. Mean. It's mean. It's a flying needle of pure hatred. One is a productive member of society and the other is a literal winged demon. If I see a bee, I'm cool. If I see a wasp, my soul is leaving my body, I'm completely cooked.

I giggled nervously. Um, yeah. Why? No, no, no, no, no! Oh! She suddenly screamed while walking as far away from me as possible. I just laughed because moms can be so weird sometimes. But the next day, my daughter came home from school crying. Mommy! Leah said her mom said she can't talk to me anymore. Leah was her best friend. I immediately took out my phone and texted her mom, asking if everything was okay. No response. I texted Emily's mom, one of the other girls in her trio. Still nothing. I had just managed to calm my baby girl down when the pizza arrived. Usually our delivery guy is the Appatron 5,000. But tonight he just set the box on my doorstep and practically ran away. George, you forgot your tip! I yelled, waving a 20. Just kept going. The next few days were insane. At my daughter's soccer practice, Helen saw me walking towards her and held her phone to her ear. No one had even called her, Helen, what's going on? She mouths sorry and walked faster. We used to complain about our husbands together. Parents were whispering and showing each other something on their phones when I walked by. They quickly put them away. By Thursday, my daughter was refusing to go to school. They moved my desk away from everyone else. Teacher said it was for space reasons, but there's like ten feet between me and Leah now. I tried to bring her to the hairdresser to cheer her up, but when the woman saw me coming, she closed early. No apology. Just flipped the sign and pulled the blinds. My phone buzzed. It was my landlord. Heard what happened. So sorry. Rent can wait this month. This was the same man who charged me a fifty dollar inconvenience it's fee when I paid rent at 12:00am instead of midnight. Then the birthday party. Emily sleepover. My daughter found out that everyone was invited except her. She was having such a bad panic attack that I had to call a hospital. Mom, what did I do? Emily is my best friend. Enough was enough. I called the school office. Something is happening to my daughter. She's being systematically excluded and I need answers right now. The counselor called back within an hour, but her voice was off. Like she was choosing every word carefully. Missus Callahan, we just wanted to check in about your home environment. Is everything safe? Anyone new spending time around your daughter? What? What are you even asking me? I think it's best if we discuss this in person. Can you come in tomorrow morning? No. You'll tell me right now why my daughter is being tortured. Long pause. The principal will explain everything tomorrow. Beep. She hung up. Then at 11 p m. An email from My gym membership terminated effective immediately. I've been going there for 5 years. The owner knew me by name. I was trying to figure out what to do when my daughter crawled into my bed at 2:00am, sobbing, Mommy, am I ugly? It took everything in me not to burst into tears. The lunch lady wouldn't look at me today. She just pointed at my tray. I finally caved. On Saturday morning, I found myself walking towards the principal's office while being escorted by a security guard. Other parents there for Saturday sports hold their kids against the walls as we passed. One mom literally shielded her son with her body, like we were dangerous. In his office, the principal locked the door behind us. The click was so loud in the silence, he walked to the windows and twisted the blinds shut. My daughter grabbed my hand tighter. Please sit down. I'll stand. What is this about? He sat at his desk, fingers hovering over his keyboard, then pulled them back. Mister Griffin, you're scaring me. Missus Callahan. He was looking at his screen, not at me.

He sacrificed everything to give his kids a better life than he ever had. He sold his truck to pay for my sister's emergency surgery when insurance said they wouldn't cover it. He worked triple shifts for six months straight to afford my brother's rehab. He even quit his job when I was getting bullied so he could homeschool me for a year. Three weeks was all the doctors gave him after finding tumors everywhere. The 40 years of breathing factory chemicals to support us finally caught up to him. They set him up with home hospice care so he could die in his own bed. He called all of us kids together on Facetime. Since my siblings lived states away, all he wanted was at least one day with each of us before he died. Nothing complicated, he said with that raspy voice the cancer gave him. Just come sit with your old man one more time. I promised him I would be there every single day since I lived 20 minutes away. My siblings swore they would come in immediately to take their turns with him. The morning my sister was supposed to arrive, dad woke up at five in the morning to get ready. The morphine made him dizzy, but he shaved, combed his hair and put on his good flannel shirt anyway. He spent three hours making her favourite cinnamon rolls from Scratch. He had to keep sitting down to breathe, but he finished them. I got there at nine to help him set everything up. Then he sat in his recliner by the window and watched for her all morning. Around 10, he said maybe her flight was delayed, but we both knew that wasn't true. By noon, she still hadn't shown up. When he called her, it went straight to voicemail, and she left all of his texts on read. Around dinner time, she finally texted him back and said her law firm had an emergency. But two hours later, she posted photos from a beachside restaurant where she was having dinner with her friends. I held his hand while he cried for the first time since mom died. The cinnamon rolls sat on touched until I threw them away after he cried himself to sleep. My brother was supposed to come the next day. Dad had me pull out the photo albums from when we were kids. He kept touching the pictures of my brother's first day of school and telling me stories I'd heard a hundred times. My brother called that morning and said, dad, I'm definitely coming, but this client meeting got moved to noon, and it's a million dollar deal, so just give me a few more hours. Dad waited in that recliner all day, but he never showed up. That night, I saw my brother posting videos from a bar. He was doing shots with Co workers and celebrating some deal they closed. Dad asked me to put the photo albums away, looking defeated. Least I have you, he whispered. The next morning, his hospice nurse, Nancy, came for her regular visit and immediately knew something was wrong. She checked his vitals and told me he was declining much faster than expected and might only have hours left. Dad asked Nancy to call my siblings for him. I sat there holding Dad's hand while she begged them to come say goodbye to him while they still could. She put it on speaker so dad could hear everything. My sister spoke first. Oh, my god. Is he seriously doing this right now? Class like dad. He always has to make everything about him. This is just another guilt trip, and I'm not falling for it. My brother jumped in next. He chose that toxic factory job over spending time with us, and now he wants us to drop everything because he. He's dying from it. That is actually hilarious. Then my sister said the worst thing possible. Tell him, I said. Thanks for the college money, but I am not wasting my vacation days to watch him rot. Dad's entire face changed into something I had never seen before. Pure ice. After they hung up, he was silent for a full minute. Then he said, call my lawyer right now. Tell him it is an emergency. Lawyer arrived within an hour with a notary. Dad signed Everything with steady hands. And recorded a video with the lawyer's phone. My two oldest children just taught me something important, he said to the camera. They think visiting me before I die is a waste of their vacation days. So they won't get a single penny when I'm gone. Everything I spent 40 years destroying my body for will go to the two people who were here for me while I died. My nurse Nancy, held my hand through hell. And my youngest never left my side. He stared straight at the lens. I spent my whole life proving I loved you both. But you just proved you never loved me back. Congratulations. You're both orphans now. Later that night, dad died with Nancy and me beside him. The house went to me and his entire safe.

So I did exactly that and watched her world crumble. She watched me get down on one knee five times and said no every single time. Eight years together, I've been playing husband since year two, paying her car note, keeping her on my insurance, covering most of the rent while she found herself through three different careers. She had this whole routine down, tears in her eyes, hand on her heart. Then some perfectly rehearsed excuse, we're not ready. Let's wait till we're more stable. The timing isn't right. Then came proposal No. 5, and she finally showed me who she really was. I'd gone all out this time, convinced myself that maybe the problem was I hadn't made it special enough. I rented out her favourite restaurants, rooftop, hung string lights everywhere and invited all our friends and family there. The whole production cost me three months salary, but I thought it'd be worth it when she finally said yes. My girlfriend stood there in the dress I'd bought her, surrounded by everyone we knew, and she didn't even let me finish the speech. Just shook her head with this pitying smile like I was a dog that wouldn't stop bringing her the same stick. Back at our apartment that night, I finally broke, asked her straight up if she loved me. Why did she keep doing this? Her whole face changed in an instant and the mask came. Completely off. It's my choice when I accept a proposal, she said. Voice ice cold. You don't get to pressure me with your timeline. You're my boyfriend, so act like one. Stop trying to be my husband when I haven't even accepted your proposal. Know your place. Know my place. For eight years of building a life together, I was supposed to know my place. Those words rewired something in my brain. Eight years of playing husband while she kept me a boyfriend status because it was convenient for her. She wanted me to act like a boyfriend. Fine. I give her exactly what she asked for. But boyfriends don't pay their girlfriends bills. Boyfriends don't share bank accounts. Boyfriends don't sacrifice their futures for someone who won't even wear their ring. I started my new boyfriend only policy the next this morning while she was at her yoga class. First, I sold the ring to a dealer for 12 grand, enough to cover what I'd spent on her car this year alone. Then I called Verizon and removed her from my phone plan. The time she got home from yoga, I changed every password and moved my money from our joint account. She didn't even notice until lunch when her phone died mid phone call. Babe, my phone's not working, she texted from her laptop, annoyed but not worried. Call Verizon. It's being weird. An hour later, they said I'm not on the account anymore. Then the panic started. Creeping in. What did you do? I responded, I'm being your boyfriend and not.

My younger sister Ariana turned into a homewrecker the moment my husband Kevin slipped the ring on my finger and started a desperate pick me routine. If Kevin were blue, she'd show up in blue. If you mentioned liking something, she'd become an expert overnight. If he posted about a restaurant, she coincidentally appeared during our date. It started subtle, almost innocent. Even like sitting next to Kevin at every family dinner, Ariana would squeeze between us, claiming she couldn't hear from the other end. I didn't mind since family is family. But after six months, it got obvious. Kevin joined a gym near his office. Ariana got a membership there the next day, showing up during his workout times and tiny sports bras. Kevin mentioned liking astronomy once. Suddenly, Ariana was texting him NASA articles daily, asking, can you explain? Then came the fake emergencies. Her car broke down near Kevin's office. Her apartment had a gas leak when I was out of town. She needed help moving heavy boxes that turned out to be empty, Kevin always told me, immediately showing me her texts with eye rolls. She's just young and confused, he'd say. And I agreed until she officially went too far. A hard knock at 9:00am and there stood Ariana in a tiny white sundress, full makeup, hair curled like a magazine shoot. I need Kevin's Help moving furniture, she announced, pushing past me. Where is he? But we both knew she lived in a furnished apartment. I was about to tell her to leave when she added, I'm sure you have errands to run. You can go away now. She was literally trying to dismiss me from my own home. Kevin came downstairs and she immediately grabbed his arm. Oh, perfect. You're already dressed. I promise I'll return him in one piece. She actually winked at me. I felt my chest burn with rage, but then had a different thought. I headed upstairs, loudly saying, I need to take a bath. But I didn't leave or go to the bathroom. I stayed upstairs where I could hear everything through the vents. She didn't waste any time. Oh, my God, Kevin, you're so muscular, she giggled, clearly touching his arm. Do you work out every day? I bet you could lift me with one hand. Wanna try? I rolled my eyes. This girl had zero shame. I kept holding laundry, waiting for Kevin's polite deflection. Instead, I heard him say, seriously, Ariana, can I tell you something important? My heart sank. Oh, god, here we.

It's the second person that shows up when you click share. Then more. Boys will often find excuses to be around you, like asking for your help or accidentally bumping into you. 20 million people have the same birthday as you. Write yours in the comments to see who shares it. If he's always the first to view your stories or react to your posts, it's because he's keeping an eye on what you're up to. Most people's phone doesn't have this secret emoji. Just comment star in square brackets to unlock it. Boys might act more confident or try to impress you when they're around you. It's their way of catching your attention. If you wanna know more signs like this, follow now because you won't wanna miss what's next. When a guy likes you, he'll find ways to touch you, even if it's just a friendly pat on the back or a high five. If he remembers tiny details you've mentioned, like your favourite song or a story from months ago, he's definitely interested. Hit like if you've seen these signs before, and drop a comment if you think someone's been showing them to you. And here's the last one. Boys might tease or playfully annoy you, but it's just their way Of getting closer and seeing your reaction.

My high school made all the boys holding their pee because someone wrote hi on the wall in Sharpie. Monday morning we all showed up to find a sign taped to the boys bathroom door. Closed until further notice due to vandalism. The girls bathroom was still open, of course, but our school only had one bathroom for boys in the entire building because it was an old school built in the 60s when they apparently thought teenage boys never needed to pee. Principal Carpenter made an announcement during first period. Due to the disrespectful graffiti found in the boys restroom, this facility will remain locked until someone comes forward with information about who did it. The entire male population of our high school groaned at the same time. The crazy part was what the graffiti actually said. My friend Peyton had seen it Friday before they locked everything up. Someone had written HI in tiny letters on the bathroom stall. Not a curse word, not a drawing. Just HI I in black Sharpie about the size of a quarter. By lunch, the situation was getting desperate. Guys were asking teachers for hall passes to go to the nurse's office just to use that bathroom. But the school nurse caught on quick and started turning people away unless they were actually sick. Some guys tried using the staff bathroom, but got detention for that. A few desperate souls walked To the gas station across the street during lunch. But security started watching for that, too. We tried talking to Principal Carpenter. Reasonably. Group of five guys went to his office to explain that punishing 300 boys for one tiny word was insane. He sat behind his big desk with his arms crossed. Actions have consequences. When the vandal comes forward, everyone gets bathroom privileges back. By Wednesday, things were getting bad. Guys were dehydrated from not drinking water all day. The basketball team couldn't practice properly because half the players were holding it in. Parents started calling to complain. The carpenter wouldn't budge. He sent out an email saying this was a lesson in collective responsibility. That's when Dean Patterson had his brilliant idea. He was this quiet kid.

I paused, looked around, and said, I never got any money. The entire table went silent. You could hear the clinking of silverware from other tables, but at ours, dead quiet. My parents froze. My dad's fork literally clattered onto his plate, and my mom's hand started shaking as she reached for her wine glass. What do you mean you never got any money? Grandma asked, her voice getting that sharp edge I remembered from when she caught my cousins lying as kids. My mom cleared her throat nervously. Mother, we can explain this later. No! Grandma's voice cut through the air like a knife. Explain it now. I've been sending three thousand dollar checks to Monica every single month since Aubrey started college. Where is that money? My brain was spinning. Three thousand dollars a month for four years. I started doing the math in my head while everyone stared at me. That's when my little sister Savannah, who'd been scrolling through Instagram this whole time, suddenly looked up. Oh, wait. Is that where mom got the money for my BMW? If the table was quiet before, now it was like a tomb. Savannah, shut up! My mom hissed, but it was too late. And my spring break trip to Cancun last month, Savannah continued, completely oblivious to the horror spreading across everyone's faces. And that designer bag you bought me for Christmas. I felt like I was watching my life in slow motion. Four years. Four brutal years of working three jobs just to afford ramen noodles and textbooks. 60 hour work weeks while my parents took family vacations. Sleeping in a moldy basement apartment while my sister got a luxury car you stole from me. I said, my voice barely a whisper. My dad finally found his voice. Aubrey, Sweetheart, it's not what it looks like. Really? I stood up, my chair scraping against the floor. Because it looks like you watched me destroy my health. Working multiple jobs while you used my money to spoil Savannah. The restaurant felt like it was spinning. I remembered all those phone calls home, begging for help with textbooks, with rent, with groceries. All those times they said money was tight, they couldn't help. I needed to learn responsibility. How much? Grandma's voice was ice cold. I did the math out loud, my voice getting stronger with each. No. 3,000 * 12 months times four years. $144,000. My mom started crying. We were going to pay it back when you graduated. With what money? I laughed, but there was no humor in it. You don't have that kind of cash lying around. You spend it all on Savannah's lifestyle. Savannah finally looked up from her phone, realize. I think this was about her. Wait, so I have to give the car back? Are you serious? Right now. I turned to her. You're worried about keeping a car that was bought with stolen money while I've been eating peanut butter sandwiches for dinner? That's when Uncle Stewart would've been unusually quiet. Spoke up Monica

First, Charlie Kirk got shot during a speech in Utah. He was literally in front of his wife and kids when a bullet entered his artery through his neck.

Then D4D has a whole body in his car, like not a metaphorical one, an actual human body in a bag in his trunk. And this dude just casually performed like he didn't have a horror movie in his backseat. What the hell? And even outside all of that, Elon Musk is no longer the richest person in the world, losing his top spot to a rival tech CEO, showing how unstable everything feels right now, even at the highest levels. It's like every time I open my phone, reality speed runs another tragedy. Like, bro, it's been 11 days. September just started. I thought my only problem this month would be math class, but no, apparently It's full blown world collapse. Society isn't just cooked, it's burnt to ash.

Oh, honey, let me tell you about the time my daughter didn't talk to me for two whole weeks because I betrayed her trust over a damn chicken nugget. So my daughter Lila, she's 14, has the attitude of a Beverly Hills housewife and the budget of a toddler. This girl acts like she's the CEO of the household, tells me things like, mom, please don't embarrass me in front of my friends. Just stand still and blink like, ma'am, you live in my uterus rent free for nine months. Show some respect. Anyway, she decides she's going vegan. Great. I support her. I buy tofu, almond milk, overpriced plant nuggets that taste like regret, the whole shebang. Do I understand it? No. But I'm a supportive queen. But then one night it's 1:00am, I'm watching reality TV in the dark and I get hungry. I open the freezer and see those dino shaped chicken nuggets she begged for last year and never ate. So I pop like 4 in the air fryer. I'm minding my business, living my best life life. And guess what? I forget to hide the evidence. Next morning she walks into the kitchen, sniffs the air like a bloodhound and goes, did you eat meat in this house? I said, um, maybe. She gasps like I just committed war crimes. You ate dead animals while I was sleeping. I said, baby girl, they were shaped like Dinosaurs, they're barely meat. Calm down. She grabs her reusable water bottle, slams it on the counter and yells, this is why the planet's dying, mom, because of people like you who can't control their midnight cravings. I said, okay, Greta Thunberg, relax. She storms off to her room and text me from down the hall. We're not speaking. This is a betrayal. I text back, fine, more dino nuggets from. She leaves me on read y'all. Two weeks she wouldn't speak to me, not even when I stubbed my toe and screamed so loud the neighbors checked on me. She just walked past me with her Hydro flask and judgmental aura. But then get this, one day I come home early from work. I walk into the kitchen and there she is standing in front of the microwave holding a plate with three dino nuggets. She's caught midbite. We lock eyes, time freezes. She goes, they don't count if they're Dinosaur shaped. I said, excuse me. She wipes her mouth like a criminal and goes, don't tell dad. I said, oh, I'm telling everyone. She bribes me with her leftover Starbucks gift card and begs for mercy. I post the photo in our family group chat. Anyway, catch then our little activist caught mid murder. Her grandpa replied, meet runs in the family. Her uncle sent a Dinosaur emoji. Now she talks to me again, but only if I swear never to bring it up again. And in front Of her friends. So what do I do? Oh, I bring it up at every chance, especially when they start talking about saving the turtles. Because if you're gonna give me the silent treatment over dino nuggets, you better be ready for extinction level consequences.

I was valedictorian, full ride to Stanford. But all my stepfather could focus on was the empty seat where my biological father should have been sitting. After the ceremony, he pulled me aside behind the gymnasium. His face was red with that particular rage he reserved for moments when I reminded him that I wasn't his. You think you're so smart, he pissed, gripping my cap so hard the tassel snapped. Walking across that stage like you accomplished something, your real dad didn't even show up because deep down everyone knows what I know, you're worthless. Mom stood 20 feet away pretending not to see. She perfected that skill over the years. That night, drunk on wine and self importance, he left me a voicemail. I almost deleted it immediately. Instead, something made me save it. His slurred words about how college would humble me, how I'd come crawling back begging for his approval, how I'd never amount to anything without his guidance. Stanford was everything he said it wouldn't be. I thrived, made Dean's list every semester. By junior year, I was already being recruited by investment firms. During spring break of my senior year, I found my stepfather in his study surrounded by real estate magazines and architectural plans. He was obsessing over the same Victorian mansion that had been for sale in our town's historic district for Three years asking price was $2.8 million, completely beyond his reach as a middle management insurance adjuster. Someday, he told mom as I passed by, when my promotion comes through, this house represents everything I've worked for. He drive past it every weekend, slowing down to stare at the wrap around porch and turret windows. It consumed him the way some people obsess over celebrities. After graduation, I moved to New York. Within two years, I was making more money than my stepfather would see in a decade. I bought a penthouse in Manhattan, built a life he said I'd never have. But I kept thinking about that house. Last month, the Victorian was back on the market. The price had dropped to $2.4 million. I flew home that weekend and toured it with a realtor. Crown molding, original hardwood floors, a library with built in shelves reaching the ceiling. I could see why my stepfather had dreamed about it. I made an all cash offer that afternoon. The closing was scheduled for a Thursday. I drove to my mother's house afterward, the deed still warm in my hands. My stepfather was in his usual spot on the recliner watching cable news and complaining about mortgage rates. Remember that Victorian you always wanted, I asked casually. His head snapped up. The Whitmore house, what about it? I bought it today. The color drained from his face. Mom stopped folding.

Last month, I took my girlfriend Ebony to get knee surgery after she tore her ACL playing soccer. My mom insisted on coming to the hospital because she wanted to support Ebony. Ebony goes into surgery and everything goes fine. When she wakes up in recovery, she's completely loopy from the anesthesia. The nurse warns us she might be a little confused and say some strange things. My mom immediately perks up. Oh, this should be interesting. Ebony opens her eyes and sees me first. Jake, you're so handsome, like a beautiful potato. Thanks, babe. How are you feeling? I feel like I'm floating. Am I floating? Are we in space? My mom laughs. No, sweetie, you're in the hospital. Ebony turns to look at my mom and her eyes go wide. Oh, my God. It's Jake's mom. You're so pretty. You look like Jake but with better hair. My mom is eating this up. Thank you, Ebony. I have something really important to tell you, Ebony says. Seriously? What's that, honey? Ebony motions for my mom to come closer. Come here. I need to whisper something in your ear. My mom leans in, expecting some sweet anesthesia confession. Ebony cups her hands around my mom's ear like she's about to share a deep secret. And then, but it's not just any burp. It's the loudest, longest, most obnoxious burp I've ever heard. And somehow in the middle of This massive belch, Ebony manages to say, I hate you. So what my mom hears directly in her ear is burp. I hate you. My mom jumps back like she's been attacked. What? Ebony starts giggling hysterically. I got you. I got you. So good. Ebony. Did you just burp I hate you in my ear? Maybe. Did it work? I'm trying not to laugh because my mom looks horrified. Ebony, that's my mom. I know she's great. I love her. That's why I gave her my special burp. My mom is still processing. Your special burp? Yeah, it's how I show affection. Jake gets them all the time. That's that's how you show affection. Ebony nods enthusiastically. The louder the burp, the more I love you. And that was a really loud burp. My mom looks at me. Jake, is this true? I'm bright red. Ebony has a very a unique way of expressing herself. Ebony interrupts Mrs. Simon. Wanna hear my impression of a dying whale? Ebony? No, but Ebony is already making horrible groaning sounds. Oh, the nurse comes running in. Is everything okay? Ebony waves at her. Hi, I'm practicing whale sounds. Ebony starts making clicking sound. Click, click, click. I'm talking to dolphins, my mom whispers to me. Is she always like this? Only when she's heavily medicated. Ebony overhears Mrs. Simon. Did Jake tell you about the time I accidentally called his dad daddy at dinner? Ebony, what? It was funny. Your dad turned So red, my mom is trying not to laugh. You called my husband daddy. Yeah. And then I asked him if he wanted to adopt me. Ebony, can we not tell my mom every embarrassing story right now? But I have so many good ones. Like time you cried watching The Notebook. Everyone cries watching The Notebook. You cried for two hours and then you made me watch it again. My mom is definitely laughing now. Jake cried for two hours. Ebony nod. And he ate an entire pint of ice cream with his hands. His hands. He said spoons were too slow for his emotional needs. I want to disappear. Ebony, you're supposed to be resting. I am resting. I'm resting my mouth by talking. The nurse checks Ebony's vitals. How are you feeling? I feel great. I just burped in Jake's mom's ear and told her I hate her, but I really love her. The nurse looks confused. You burped what? Ebony demonstrates by making another loud burping sound like that, but with words inside. My mom shakes her head. I've never experienced anything like that. Missus Simon, want me to teach you? Ebony, please don't teach my mom how to burp words. Why not? You never know when you might need to burp. Communicate. Ebony turns back to my mom. Missus Simon, I have another secret to tell you. My mom hesitates. Are you going to burp in my ear again? No. This is a real secret. Come closer. My mom cautiously leans in. Ebony whispered, I'm going to marry your son. My mom's face lights up. Really? Yeah. But don't tell him I'm going to propose to him, Ebony. That's not how proposals usually work. Why not? I'm a modern woman. I can post my potato boyfriend. Potato boyfriend. Ebony looks at me lovingly. Yeah, he's my beautiful potato. My mom is crying from laughing. Ebony, you're delightful. Thank you. That's why I gave you my best burp. The anesthesia starts wearing off and Ebony gets sleepy. Mrs. Simon, will you visit me when I'm not high on drugs? Of course, sweetie. Good. Next time I'll teach you my burping alphabet.

It's pathetic. So I put a stop to our fake marriage. We've been married for five years and I thought I was being the perfect husband. I spent three hours cooking her favorite meal for our anniversary, set up candles, even dug out that playlist from our first date. When she walked through the door with her sister and best friend, she took one look at the setup, rolled her eyes and said loud enough for everyone to hear, stop trying to be romantic. It's pathetic. You look desperate. Then she turned to her friends. This is exactly what I was telling you about. He does this needy stuff constantly. The room went dead silent. Her sister looked uncomfortable. Her best friend stared at the floor. I stood there holding wine, watching my wife destroy our marriage with one sentence. I set the wine down, looked her straight in the eye and said, you know what, you're absolutely right. She expected me to apologize, to scramble. Instead, I started blowing out the candles. What are you doing? She asked, losing that confident edge. Stopping, I replied, gathering the flowers. Romance is pathetic when it's one sided. So I'm done being pathetic. I tossed the flowers in the trash and ordered pizza. We can eat like roommates from now on, pepperoni or cheese. That night she tried damage control, talking about bad days, overreacting. But something had shifted in me. I heard you. Perfectly, I told her. Message received. No more romantic gestures, no more pathetic behavior. She laughed it off. Maybe we both need to be more realistic about what marriage actually is. Those words would haunt her the next morning. I didn't bring her coffee in bed like I had every weekend for five years. When she came downstairs expecting her usual cup, I was finishing mine. Coffee's in the kitchen, I said. Without looking, I saw our marriage clearly for the first time. I was the one planning date nights she'd complain about. I was the one remembering anniversaries. I was the one keeping romance alive. When I stopped being romantic, I stopped with everything unnecessary. No more good morning kisses, no more asking about her day. No more caring where she went. By day 10, the cracks show. Are you going to ask me about my presentation? She said, clearly fishing. Do you want to tell me about it? Well, it went well, she said, waiting for follow up questions that never came. Good for you. I went back to my phone. She stood there for a full minute waiting for me to engage. When it became clear I wasn't playing that role anymore, she left without another word. Three weeks in, she was losing her mind. She mentioned male co workers talk about her ex reaching out, brought up how attentive other husbands were. Each comment was fishing for jealousy. Any sign I still cared. My response was Always. That's interesting. Then I'd return to whatever I was doing. I'd started hitting the gym, reading books, learn in guitar, something she'd always dismissed as a waste of time. One month in, she cracked. She was waiting at the kitchen table when I got home. Papers spread everywhere. We need to talk. You're punishing me because your feelings got hurt. My feelings got hurt. I repeated, you humiliated me in front of your friends. Called five years of romantic gesture.

Like, who decided that was enough? Two days? That's not a break, that's a prank. Like, I touch my bed on Friday, and the next thing I know, the alarms ringing and it's Monday morning. And honestly, who even invented the seven day week? Like, what if there's actually supposed to be 10 or 18 days and we all just got scammed? And why is the ratio five days of pain to two days of peace? That's like ordering a pizza and only getting two slices. Because here's the thing. The weekend is not even a real weekend. Friday night is gone in a blink, Saturday doesn't even exist. It's more like catch up on chores day, and Sunday is finish all the homework you got day. Like, why do we even get homework? Is the weekend not supposed to be the week's end? Am I not supposed to rest? Meanwhile, school takes five whole days. Five. Imagine working five shifts at a job you never applied for. And the pay. See you again on Monday. Like, bro, at least jobs give you money. School gives you stress, exams, annoying teachers, and fire drills at 8:00am when it's freezing outside. Honestly, I wish we could flip it. Two days of school, five days of weekend. That's balance. That's peace. Until then, I'll be sitting in class every Monday wondering if dropping out is a spiritual call. No.

I painted it. I was standing in front of my largest piece at the gallery opening, champagne in hand, when a man in an expensive suit approached and started explaining my own painting to me. He had no idea I was the artist because the placard said Riley Turner, who he clearly assumed was a man since he kept talking about his brilliant technique. This guy Robert looked me up and down and said, you seem young to be at an opening like this. Let me guess, looking for a rich boyfriend? Smart girl. Lots of wealthy men here. He gestured at my painting like he owned it. See, what Riley is doing here requires years of training to appreciate. You probably just think the colors are pretty. The average woman just sees decoration. I took a sip of champagne and said, interest in perspective, which I guess he took as encouragement. Robert moved closer to the painting, physically stepping in front of me, and continued his lecture. A Girl Like You probably thinks this is just nice to look at, but there's actual intelligence behind it. The artist is obviously a man because women simply don't have this kind of technical mastery. Female painters do. Flowers and feelings. This has real intellectual depth. It's biological, really. Men are just more capable of this level of abstraction. When I mentioned I was Familiar with the artist's work. Robert laughed and patted my shoulder. Following him on Instagram to look at the pretty pictures doesn't count as being familiar with art, sweetheart. You probably think you're cultured because you went to that Van Gogh light show. Real knowledge comes from decades of study, not whatever you Learned from TikTok. Robert decided to test me. Rapid firing questions. Who's Basquiat? What's Kiara Scuro? Name three Renaissance painters besides Da Vinci. When I started to answer, he cut me off. Wrong. See this? This is why galleries shouldn't have open events. You probably googled some terms before coming here to impress men, but Riley here is working in a tradition you couldn't possibly understand without a proper education. Not community college, sweetie. Real universities. He returned to my painting, now explaining it louder to draw a crowd. What Riley has achieved here would cost probably 100,000 in education to even the materials alone cost more than you'd make in a month at whatever retail job you have. He looked at my outfit with disgust. Target clearance rack, right? Someone who shops there couldn't possibly grasp the investment in this piece. He probably spent more on one brush than your entire outfit. When I suggested the artist might be self taught, Robert sneered at me. Is that how you Learned about art? Painting parties? Robert grabbed my wrist, only to another angle, his grip too tight. You're too stupid to even stand in the right spot. Riley intended for this to be viewed from exactly here. Your ignorance is actually disrespectful to his work. He kept his hand on my wrist while explaining, though. Honestly, explaining this to you is like teaching calculus to a toddler. You lack the basic foundation to understand any of it. He noticed me trying to pull away and

My mom thought men were the cause of all evil. Ever since dad left us when I was 7. But that was years ago now. At 13, I had to wear this hideous shirt to school that said no boyfriends in three pink letters. She installed tracking apps, called during every free period, and even put a ring camera pointing at my bedroom window. But a small part of me understood why she was such a helicopter parent. We lived in a sketchy neighborhood. The first time I got cat called was on my eighth birthday. I was wearing a tutu skirt and with no man walking with us to protect us. We both got harassed by men all the time. So I could kind of see why she hated the male species so much. But here's the thing. All her rules didn't stop the harassment. They just made me an easier target. A girl walking alone, obviously without a boyfriend, practically wearing a sign that said vulnerable. That's when I met him. This guy from my chemistry class who noticed me speed walking past the bad corner one day, keys between my fingers, like mom taught me. Hey! He called out, you okay? I kept walking. Stranger danger and all that, but he persisted. I lived two blocks over. We could walk together. Mom's voice echoed in my head. That's how it starts. So I said no, practically ran away. But I noticed Him after that? Always seemed to be around when I was walking home. This went on for weeks. Until the day everything changed. One day, three guys started following me. My heart hammered as I fumbled for my phone. Then chemistry boy appeared. Just walked right up and put his arm around me. Hey, babe. Sorry I'm late. The guys backed off. Immediately. After they left, he dropped his arm. You good? When I nodded, he said something that made my skin prickle. I don't like you walking alone. Sweet or possessive? I couldn't tell. But either way, I was more scared of those three guys than him. So when he offered again, I finally said yes. Walks became a secret thing. Chemistry boy knew my whole schedule. Always texted home safe if he couldn't walk with me. Started teaching me self defense moves in the park. His hands adjusting my stance, showing me how to break a grip. Every girl should know this stuff, he said. But Mom's words never left my mind. Predators like to establish control. He'd appear at weird times. Just happened to be in the area. Sure. Once I joked about him following me, and his face went serious. I noticed things like that car that's been parked outside your house. I could have run then. Instead, I kept meeting him. Mom almost caught us once. I was in the middle of showing him where I lived. But I know when my mom's car turned The corner early. He practically dove behind a dumpster. My heart pounded as mom pulled up. Who are you talking to? Nobody. Just on the phone. I thought I was being so clever, sneaking around her rules. Turns out someone else was sneaking around, too, because a few days later, our neighbor, Mrs. Doyle, got robbed in broad daylight by someone who knew exactly when she'd be alone. The cop said mom went nuclear. It's always someone they trusted, someone who Learned their routine. She stared at me hard. You haven't been talking to any boys, right? I lied through my teeth while my phone buzzed. Another home safe text. Mystery Boy texted a lot. Like, a lot. Always asking where I was, who I was with. Once I didn't respond for an hour, and he showed up at the library looking panicked. Just worried, he said. Well, three weeks and two more neighborhood break ins later, I decided having him around was better than being alone. On days when my mom worked later, he'd sit in my closet doing homework while I kept watch. This is insane. Yeah, no kidding. Everything came crashing down on a Thursday. Mom came home early with a migraine. I barely got him in the closet before she walked in. Just gonna lie down, she said, heading to her room. He was trapped. My phone lit up with his text. Still in here? No sheet, Sherlock. That's when I heard it. Glass breaking downstairs. My whole body went ice cold. Mom appeared in my doorway, face white. Did you hear that? We froze as footsteps creaked on the stairs. Heavy, deliberate. Mom's eyes went wide. She mouth 9 1 1, but her phone was downstairs in her purse. Mine was dead. The foot steps got closer. My 4 eleven. Mom pushed me behind her, grabbing my field hockey stick. The door swung open. A man in a ski mask stood there, knife glinting. Mom swung the stick, but he caught it, yanked it away, shoved her heart into the wall. I screamed. The closet door exploded open. Chemistry boy launched himself at the intruder using those same moves he taught me. They crashed into the hallway. Call 9 1 1! He yelled.

How has it gone for you? When my wife Rachel and I adopted Devon at six years old, they told us she had mild trust issues. What they didn't tell us was that she'd been returned by three families already. Devon showed up at our house with one tiny suitcase and a backpack that first night. I watched her through the doorway as she carefully laid out all her clothes on the bed. She folded each piece perfectly, put it back in the suitcase, and zipped it up. Then she slept on top of the covers, fully dressed. I thought maybe she was just nervous, but weeks went by, and that suitcase never got unpacked. We take out one outfit each morning, wear it all day, then fold it back up at night. Her closet stayed completely empty. Rachel tried everything. New sheets with unicorns on them, a night light shaped like a butterfly. We even let her pick out paint for her room walls. He chose white. Just plain white like before. One morning, I found her in the kitchen at 5 a m. Making her own breakfast. Toast with no butter. Just dry bread. When I asked why she was up so early, she said, I didn't want to bother you guys. Sometimes people get mad when kids wake them up. That broke my heart. Rachel and I had been trying for years to have kids. We dreamed About Saturday morning pancakes and bedtime stories. But Devin acted like she was living in a hotel, not a home. The real wake up call came three months later. I got home from work and heard crying upstairs. I found Devon sitting on her bed, holding that stupid suitcase in her lap. What's wrong, sweetheart? She looked up at me with these huge brown eyes and said, I heard you and Rachel fighting last night about money. I know kids cost a lot. I can go back to Miss Janet tomorrow if you want. Miss Janet was her social worker. My throat got tight. Rachel and I had been arguing about our car payment. Nothing to do with Devon at all. Devon, we weren't fighting about you. We love having you here. She just shrugged. That's what the Johnson said, too. And the Millers. They all said I was special. Until I wasn't anymore. That night, Rachel and I sat up talking until 3 a m. We realized Devon wasn't just scared of us leaving her. She was waiting for us to leave her. She'd been through this routine before. Nice family, happy faces. Then back to foster care. When things got tough the next day, I had an idea. I went to the hardware store and bought the biggest picture frame they had, like three feet wide. Then Rachel and I spent the whole weekend taking photos. Devon at breakfast, Devon watching TV, Devon playing with our dog, Charlie. Just normal, boring family stuff. We printed out all the pictures and arranged them in the frame. Beach trips we took her on. Movie nights on the couch. Devon's first day at her new school. Even the bad pictures where someone was making a weird face. When Devon got home from school Monday, we called her into the living room.

It's 7:00am. I'm still half asleep with coffee when my daughter bust into the bathroom like the FBI. She's holding her underwear up like a bloody flag and screaming, mom, I'm leaking from the wrong end! I'm gonna die! I nearly spit coffee everywhere. I say, sweetheart, calm down. That's just your period. She freezes, squints at me and yells, you liar! I knew you made that story up few months ago. I actually explained this whole thing Saturday down. Gave her the talk, showed her pictures. She rolled her eyes and said, nice prank, mom. You really think I'm that dumb? Now she's standing here like I faked the whole biology system just to mess with her. She stomps her foot. So you mean to tell me women eat every month and just go to target like nothing happened? She's pacing, yelling, you could have stopped this! You're my mom, not my enemy! I hand her a pad. She picks it up with two fingers like it's radioactive. This is a diaper. You want me to wear a diaper to school? Kids already bully me for my Lunchables. If I sound like a Doritos bag when I walk, I'm done. She sticks it on, takes two steps. Crunch, crunch! She stops, dead serious. Perfect. Now I'm Miss Fritos. Then she whispers, wait, does dad get this, too? I almost choked on my coffee. No, baby, only girls! She screams. Figures. Men don't do anything. They just fart and watch football while we bleed like stabbed pumpkins. She comes home from school later, furious. Mom, you didn't warn me the pad sticks to your leg hair. I was in that stall fighting for my life. People thought I was wrestling a raccoon. Then she adds, and when I sneezed in math, I thought my kidney fell out. Thanks, mom. Now they call me Leaky Lindsay. That night, she's on the couch, blanket eating pad, hot Cheetos in her lap, looking like a soldier who saw combat. She points at her brother and yells, enjoy your balls, loser! My. This is literally trying to kill me. He cried into his Pop Tarts. Next morning, she tries to get out of chores. Mom, I can't clean. My uterus is in critical condition. I say, nope. She glares at me, wow, you're a woman, too? And you still betrayed me. You're basically a war criminal. At dinner, my husband's carving chicken. It's calm. Suddenly, she stands up, bangs her glass with a fork, and goes, ladies and gentlemen, I am now a woman. My uterus has joined the group chat. Please clap. My husband choked on a drumstick. My son screamed, gross! And ran upstairs. And the grand finale. She whips out a Sharpie, lifts her shirt, and across her stomach she's written in giant letters, congrats, dad! You're next! I nearly passed out laughing. My husband dropped his fork like he saw a Ghost! My son slammed his door, and my daughter, she just sat back down, grabbed mashed potatoes with her hands, and goes.

My mom thought men were the cause of all evil. Ever since dad left us when I was 7. But that was years ago now. At 13, I had to wear this hideous shirt to school that said no boyfriends in three pink letters. She installed tracking apps, called during every free period, and even put a ring camera pointing at my bedroom window. But a small part of me understood why she was such a helicopter parent. We lived in a sketchy neighborhood. The first time I got cat called was on my eighth birthday. I was wearing a tutu skirt and with no man walking with us to protect us. We both got harassed by men all the time. So I could kind of see why she hated the male species so much. But here's the thing. All her rules didn't stop the harassment. They just made me an easier target. A girl walking alone, obviously without a boyfriend, practically wearing a sign that said vulnerable. That's when I met him. This guy from my chemistry class who noticed me speed walking past the bad corner one day, keys between my fingers, like mom taught me. Hey! He called out, you okay? I kept walking. Stranger danger and all that, but he persisted. I lived two blocks over. We could walk together. Mom's voice echoed in my head. That's how it starts. So I said no, practically ran away. But I noticed Him after that? Always seemed to be around when I was walking home. This went on for weeks. Until the day everything changed. One day, three guys started following me. My heart hammered as I fumbled for my phone. Then chemistry boy appeared. Just walked right up and put his arm around me. Hey, babe. Sorry I'm late. The guys backed off. Immediately. After they left, he dropped his arm. You good? When I nodded, he said something that made my skin prickle. I don't like you walking alone. Sweet or possessive? I couldn't tell. But either way, I was more scared of those three guys than him. So when he offered again, I finally said yes. Walks became a secret thing. Chemistry boy knew my whole schedule. Always texted home safe if he couldn't walk with me. Started teaching me self defense moves in the park. His hands adjusting my stance, showing me how to break a grip. Every girl should know this stuff, he said. But Mom's words never left my mind. Predators like to establish control. He'd appear at weird times. Just happened to be in the area. Sure. Once I joked about him following me, and his face went serious. I noticed things like that car that's been parked outside your house. I could have run then. Instead, I kept meeting him. Mom almost caught us once. I was in the middle of showing him where I lived. But I know when my mom's car turned The corner early. He practically dove behind a dumpster. My heart pounded as mom pulled up. Who are you talking to? Nobody. Just on the phone. I thought I was being so clever, sneaking around her rules. Turns out someone else was sneaking around, too, because a few days later, our neighbor, Mrs. Doyle, got robbed in broad daylight by someone who knew exactly when she'd be alone. The cop said mom went nuclear. It's always someone they trusted, someone who Learned their routine. She stared at me hard. You haven't been talking to any boys, right? I lied through my teeth while my phone buzzed. Another home safe text. Mystery Boy texted a lot. Like, a lot. Always asking where I was, who I was with. Once I didn't respond for an hour, and he showed up at the library looking panicked. Just worried, he said. Well, three weeks and two more neighborhood break ins later, I decided having him around was better than being alone. On days when my mom worked later, he'd sit in my closet doing homework while I kept watch. This is insane. Yeah, no kidding. Everything came crashing down on a Thursday. Mom came home early with a migraine. I barely got him in the closet before she walked in. Just gonna lie down, she said, heading to her room. He was trapped. My phone lit up with his text. Still in here? No sheet, Sherlock. That's when I heard it. Glass breaking downstairs. My whole body went ice cold. Mom appeared in my doorway, face white. Did you hear that? We froze as footsteps creaked on the stairs. Heavy, deliberate. Mom's eyes went wide. She mouth 9 1 1, but her phone was downstairs in her purse. Mine was dead. The foot steps got closer. My 4:11. Mom pushed me behind her, grabbing my field hockey stick. The door swung open. A man in a ski mask stood there, knife glinting. Mom swung the stick, but he caught it, yanked it away, shoved her heart into the wall. I screamed. The closet door exploded open. Chemistry boy launched himself at the intruder using those same moves he taught me. They crashed into the hallway. Call 9 1 1! He yelled.

It started when my sister Chloe came home crying because her boyfriend Jake dumped her. She's 25 and I'm 17, but she always acts like she's the victim in every situation. This time was different, though. She kept saying Jake was horrible and cruel. But when I asked what happened, she got all shifty. He said he broke up with her out of nowhere and kicked her out of his apartment. But then she mentioned she still had keys to his place because she forgot to give them back. The next day, she left early in the morning and came back with this huge golden retriever. I recognized him immediately. It was Buster, Jake's dog. Love that dog more than anything. When his grandpa died last year, Buster was the only thing that helped him through it. I asked Chloe why she had Buster, and she got this weird smile on her face. She said Jake didn't deserve to keep him since he broke her heart. Then she said something that made my stomach drop. She told me she was going to take Buster to the vet tomorrow to put him down as payback for what Jake did to her. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. This dog was completely healthy and happy, just confused about being in a new place. Buster kept looking around for Jake and whining by the door. It was heartbreaking. I Told Chloe she was being insane and she couldn't just kill someone's dog because she was upset. She laughed and said Jake should have thought about that before he decided to hurt her. Then she said if I told anyone, she'd make sure I regretted it. That night I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about Buster and how scared he must be. Around 2:00am, I heard Chloe on the phone with someone, probably making the vet appointment. I knew I had to do something. Then next morning, Chloe left for work and told mom she was taking Buster for a walk later. Mom didn't know the whole story. Chloe just said Jake asked her to watch his dog for a few days. As soon as both then were gone, I called Jake. He picked up on the first ring and sounded terrible. I told him Chloe had Buster and was planning to put him down today. He went completely silent for like 10 seconds, then started freaking out. He said he'd been looking everywhere for Buster and thought maybe he got out somehow. I told Jake to come over now while Chloe was at work. He was at our house in 15 minutes. When he saw Buster, he literally started crying. Buster went crazy with excitement, jumping all over him and licking his face. I opened the door and Jake carried his dog out to his car. Before he left, Jake told me what really happened with Chloe. She didn't Just get dumped. She cheated on him with his best friend, Marcus. When Jake found out, he broke up with her and told her to move out. She stole Buster on her way out and left Jake's spare key on the counter so he thought she was being mature about the breakup. A few hours later, Chloe came home and went straight to look for Buster. When she couldn't find him, she started screaming my name. She found me in my room and absolutely lost it. She called me a traitor and said I had no right to interfere in her business. Then mom came home and asked what all the yelling was about. Chloe told her I let some guy steal her dog. She made it sound like I just gave away her pet to a random stranger. Mom looked

My 6 year old nephew absolutely destroyed my sister at Thanksgiving dinner. And honestly, she deserved it. My sister Emma has always been obsessed with appearances, perfect makeup, designer clothes, constantly taking selfies. She's the type who spends two hours getting ready just to go to target. At family dinners, she'd always make these passive aggressive comments about everyone else's life choices. So we're all sitting around the table Last Thanksgiving. Emma shows up an hour late because she had to get her nails done. She's wearing this ridiculous white dress to a family dinner where we're eating gravy and cranberry sauce. Classic Emma move. She immediately starts her usual routine, comments about how Mom's stuffing has too much salt this year, mentions how Uncle Rick should probably lay off the dinner rolls, makes this big show of only eating tiny portions because she's watching her figure. Then she turns to my brother Jake, who just started community college. So Jake, still taking those little classes. When are you going to get a real degree? Jake just stared at his plate. The kids working two jobs to pay for school. Emma kept going. She asked my cousin about her starter apartment and wondered when she'd get a grown up job. She even made a comment about dad's old truck in the driveway saying it was embarrassing. The whole time my nephew Tyler was just sitting there eating his Turkey. And watching Tyler's, Jake's 6 year old son, super quiet kid, usually just plays with his food and doesn't say much during adult conversations. Emma was on a roll. She started talking about her new boyfriend's BMW and how they're looking at condos downtown, really laying it on thick about how successful she is compared to everyone else. Then she made her biggest mistake. She looked at Tyler and said, Tyler, sweetie, make sure you study hard in school so you don't end up like your daddy. Okay? The table went dead silent. Jake's face turned red. Mom literally gasped. Dad put down his fork and just stared at Emma. But Tyler. Tyler just looked up from his mashed potatoes, blinked those big innocent eyes and said in the sweetest voice ever, Aunt Emma, why?

I want him to offer like a normal human. So I start dropping hints. A McDonald's commercial comes on and I'm like, dang, a Mcchicken would go crazy right now. Then I get up to grab a glass of water and stare into the fridge like I'm touring an art museum. I even ask, yo, do you guys ever do pizza rolls here or. Nah. He just shrugs and says, I'm not really hungry. Oh, ask about you. But then when he finally picks up on the hint, instead of having his mom make us a snack, he just leans toward the kitchen and yells, mom dog is hungry. Can you make him something? Like, bro, oh, why would you say it like that? Now she either thinks my parents don't feed me at home or I'm a big back here to clear out her fridge. Yeah, do I secretly want to inhale all the food in their house? Yes, but that's beside the point. Subscribe.

Congratulations, that's called being a human. Look, I get it. Mental health awareness is hella important. It's amazing that people are talking about it more openly now. But here's the problem scrolling through hashtags at 2:00am is not the same thing as a professional evaluation. Google is not your therapist. ID Labs tests are not your psychiatrist. And that one influencer who talks about their symptoms in a story time? Definitely not a doctor. When everyone just casually slaps a label on themselves, it waters down the real struggles people actually face. Like someone living with legit OCD is out here battling life every day and then some dude is like oh my god I'm so OCD I color code my closet. No, you're not OCD. You're just organized my guy.

V6 or V8, turbo charged, manual or automatic bro, I don't know. It was red. He'll look at a car for 0.2 seconds and go, yeah, that's a 2012 Audi S4B 8.5 with the DSG transmission and optional Black optics package. I'm sorry how you didn't even blink and they're always judging you pull up in your normal car and they're like, front wheel drive, that's crazy. Like bro, I'm just trying to get to Tesco. You can't enjoy life around this guy. You'll see a Lamborghini drive past and go, yo, that's sick. He's like, actually that's the Hurricane Evo, not the performante fake exhaust sound mid bro, shut up, it looks cool and it goes V room. Even in traffic, he's different. You're sitting there like a normal person, bored. He's sitting there like, yo, is that an E92 M3 on the other lane that in line six sings bro, I swear he's gonna propose to an engine one day and don't even ask him for car advice. He'll be like, yeah bro, just get a 2007 BMW 3:35. I trust me. Reliable, fun, daily driver. That thing breaks down if the weather sneezes. Then he acts shocked when your Engine explodes after a week. Did you warm it up properly? No, I turned it on. It's a car, not a baby. Like bro chill. Not everything is a race. I just need something that gets me from point a to point B without catching fire. But no, to him, it's all about horsepower, torque, Rev matching downshifts, the never bring lap time. Meanwhile. I just want AC and Bluetooth. Stop it. Get help. You're not Vin Diesel. You're just my mate who gets emotionally attached to vehicles.

Ten people fighting over the last slice of pizza like it's a custody battle. Someone sneaking chips at 4:00am and the crinkle of the bag might as well be a fire alarm. When morning comes, everyone wakes up looking like they've survived a natural disaster. Hair's a mess, someone's missing a sock and the kid who slept on the floor can't walk straight anymore.

Our cafeteria had this weird echo problem in the back corner where the ceiling tiles were loose. If you whispered there during lunch, it would amplify and carry across the entire room like a ghost voice. I discovered this by accident when I was hiding back there, eating alone, complaining under my breath about Mister Rodriguez's impossible math test. Suddenly, half the cafeteria turned around looking confused. That's when the idea hit me. I started small, whispering random stuff during lunch to test the range. Someone left their car lights on or free pizza in the gym, just enough to watch heads turn and people look around confused. The acoustics were perfect. My voice would bounce off the loose tiles, get amplified by the weird ceiling cavity, then float across the room like some supernatural announce. It sounded nothing like my normal voice, more like a distant radio transmission or a voice from another dimension. But then I overheard the drama that would change everything. Jessica Chen was bragging to her friends about how she'd been anonymously reporting kids to administration for vaping. I've gotten like 12 people suspended, he laughed. They have no idea it's me. I just sent anonymous tips to Principal Walsh's email. She was proud of it, genuinely proud of ruining people's lives for a few extra points on her college applications. Perfect. Target acquired. The next day during lunch, I positioned myself in the Echo corner. I Waited until Jessica was surrounded by her usual crowd, then whispered just loud enough. Jessica Chen is the vaping snitch, the whisper.

I've been popping melatonin gummies like they were fruit snacks, man, and they haven't done shit. And guys, when I mean that, I've tried literally every single tactic I could. I mean that shit. I set 4 alarms. I slept through every single one. I was so desperate I asked my stepdad, hey, when you're getting ready for work, wake me up too. This dude really told me that. My stupid ass woke up, shook his head, and then fell back asleep. Who the fuck does that? And the crazy thing about it too is that I don't even remember any of these things happening, and all I remember is waking up at 2 p. M. With one sock on my right foot. Like, what the hell just happened? And what makes this shit even worse is that I have to open up Snapchat and Instagram. I gotta see these chocolate at my school talking about some bullshit. Like guys, I'm actually excited to start school again. And who's in my class? Shut the fuck up talking about I Miss school so much. How you already pre glazing the teachers? You haven't even met him yet. Man. Can't wait to get back into academia and pursue my academic prowess. Like god damn bro zip it up when you're done.

Fam, I'm the exact same motherfucker who they saw get sent to OAC. Nothing changed about me. I actually can't do this anymore man. There's no way. School starting in two days bro. I'm so fucked.

I gotta say this because it's been sitting on my chest. Nobody, and I mean nobody, should be celebrating Charlie Kirk's death. And before anybody gets mad at me, hear me out. I don't care if you hated what he stood for. I don't care if you never agreed with a single thing that came out of his mouth. There's a difference between disagreeing with someone and actually cheering when they're gone. Like, do you realize how weird that is? A man just lost his life, and the first instinct some people have is to make jokes, memes, clap, emojis, little he deserved it comments, bro. That's not activism. That's not standing for what you believe in. That's just heartless. And let's not forget, behind all the politics, behind all the headlines, there's a real family sitting there grieving. There's a wife who just lost her husband. There's kids who just lost their dad. Imagine being them, scrolling online and seeing people laugh about it. That doesn't make you powerful. It doesn't make you woke. It makes you cold. Here's the bigger picture. When you start normalizing this energy, when you start clapping every time somebody you don't like goes down, you're not actually winning anything. You're just feeding into the same negativity you claim to be against. You're lowering the bar of empathy until there's nothing left. And what happens then? Everyone's just waiting for the next tragedy to entertain them. That's not society. That's just chaos. You can hate his views, you can call out his words, you can spend your whole life disagreeing with the man. That's fine. That's human. But death is bigger than politics. Death is bigger than arguments. And if we really want the world to be a better place, maybe it starts with not cheering when someone's gone. So, yeah, nobody should be celebrating Charlie Kirk's death. You don't gotta like him, but at least respect life. Because if you lose that, if you can't even respect the finality of death, then, honestly, what does that say about you?

When I tried to correct my stepdaughter, I just smiled and said, alright. I'm Brandon, 38 and married to Samantha for three years. She has twin 12 year olds from her first marriage, Charlotte and Aiden. Their dad sends birthday cards twice a year if we're lucky. Last Tuesday, I caught Charlotte stealing 20 bucks from Samantha's purse. When I confronted her, she rolled her eyes and said, you're not my real dad. You can't tell me what to do. I calmly told Samantha what happened. Instead of addressing the theft, she got defensive. Don't lecture my kids about money. If you want a parent so badly, get your own children. That's dumb. But I just smiled and said, alright. See, what Samantha didn't know was that I've been covering their car insurance, phone bills and school supplies for months. While she struggled with debt, I'd also been quietly setting aside college funds for both kids, $400 a month each in the savings accounts they didn't even know existed. The next morning, I canceled everything. Car insurance, gone. Phone plan, terminated. The college accounts I'd open, closed and transferred to my personal savings. I also stopped buying groceries. No more weekly 200 dollar trips to keep the pantry stocked. No more paying for their Netflix, Spotify or Charlotte's dance classes that cost me $150 a month. Aiden soccer registration fees, not my problem anymore. I even canceled the family gym. Membership and stopped paying for their school lunches. Every subscription, every monthly payment, every little expense I've been quietly handling, all of it gone. When Charlotte's phone got shut off at school and she couldn't call her friends, she came home furious. Why isn't my phone working? Ask your mom, I said, not looking up from my laptop. Aiden couldn't get picked up from soccer practice because the car insurance had lapsed and Samantha's registration was expired. She had to leave work early, costing her overtime pay she desperately needed. That evening, Samantha panicked when she opened the fridge to find it nearly empty. The pantry was bare except for some stale crackers and a can of beans. Where's all the food? What happened to everything? She demanded, hands shaking as she looked at the empty shelf.

When I messed up, when I broke Mrs. Wilson's window playing baseball, Nate took the blame and got grounded for two weeks. When I failed my math test, spent hours helping me study for the retake. We shared everything, our tiny bedroom, video games, even a fake ID when we got to college, our parents died in a car crash when I was 15. The whole world felt like it was ending. But Nate stepped up immediately. He was only 22, barely an adult himself, but he became my legal guardian without hesitation. He dropped out of his senior year, got two jobs, working at a warehouse during the day and cleaning offices at night. I never heard him complain once. He'd come home exhausted, covered in sweat and dust, but still help me with homework. When other kids got allowances, Nate made sure I had lunch money. When I wanted new sneakers, he worked overtime to get them. He never made me feel like a burden, even though I knew I was draining every penny he earned. I graduated high school with decent grades and got into State College. Nate was so proud. He cried at my graduation, said our parents would have been proud, too. He kept working those same two jobs to pay my Tuition, living off ramen noodles and hope. I promised him someday I'd pay him back for everything. Four years later, I landed a good job at an accounting firm, finally making real money. First thing I did was try to give Nate cash, but he refused, said seeing me succeed was payment enough. That's just how he was, never wanted anything for himself. Last Thanksgiving, I brought my fiance, Emma, home to meet him. She'd heard all my stories about my amazing big brother who raised me. They got along great, laughing at old photos, Nate telling embarrassing stories about when I was little. Everything felt perfect. Later that night, after Emma went to bed, Nate asked me to sit down. He looked nervous, fidgeting with his coffee cup like he used to do when we were kids. And he had something serious to tell me.

I slammed on the brakes and jumped out of my car. Nora, baby, what are you doing out here? She was shivering violently and just her school clothes, no coat, tears frozen on her little cheeks. Daddy locked me out, he said. I can't come back until you get home from work. My heart dropped. It was nine PM on a Friday. Jonathan knew I always worked late on Fridays. This wasn't an accident. How long have you been out here since you left this morning, she whispered. I scooped her up feeling how ice cold her little body was and carried her toward our front door. It was locked. I used my key, Fury building with every step. I found Jonathan exactly where I expected, sprawled on the couch in his boxers and T-shirt, controller in hand, playing call of duty. The heat was cranked up to 75 degrees. Empty beer cans littered the coffee table. Why was our daughter outside for 12 hours? I tried to keep my voice calm. He didn't even pause his game. She spilled grape juice on my new controller this morning. I told her actions have consequences. I stared at him in disbelief. She's 6 years old, Jonathan. She spilled juice accidentally and you left her outside to freeze? Maybe next time she'll be more careful around my stuff. That's when I noticed Nora's Pink backpack sitting by the front door. It was stuffed, bulging at the seams. Her favorite stuffed bunny was sticking out the top. What's this? I pointed at the bag. Jonathan finally paused his game and turned to look at me. There was something cold in his eyes I never seen before. I've been doing a lot of thinking today. While she was outside, he said slowly, this whole family thing isn't working out for me, nor is too much work, too expensive, too loud. And honestly, I never wanted kids in the first place. The room started spinning. What are you talking about? I'm talking about you taking her and leaving tonight. I already had the locks changed while you were at work. You just got lucky I hadn't switched them out yet. I felt like I was in a nightmare. You're abandoning your own daughter. Nora was still clinging to me, her wet clothes soaking through my work blazer. She was listening to every word, her big brown eyes darting between us. Here's the thing. Jonathan stood up, stretching like this was all perfectly normal. She's not really mine anyway. I mean, yeah, biologically, whatever, but I never signed up for this dad life. You can have her. The casual cruelty in his voice made me sick. This was the man I've been married to for eight years, the man who used to read Nora bedtime stories. Jonathan, she's your daughter. You can't just watch me. He picked Up phone. I already talked to my buddy Steven, who's a lawyer. Apparently, if I just voluntarily give up my parental rights, I don't have to pay child support either. Win, win. My hands started shaking, but not from fear, from rage. I pulled out my phone and speed dialed a number I'd hoped I'd never have to use. Hi, Christine. It's Caroline. Remember that emergency custody documentation we discussed six months ago? File everything tonight. Jonathan's controller slipped from his hands. What are you doing? What you should have expected when you decided to mess with my.

After the video exposing my bullies went viral, my principal randomly called me into his office saying he wanted to talk. So I'm thinking, finally, those girls are about to get punished for the public humiliation they caused me. But I couldn't have been more wrong. I walk in the room and see the two girls already sitting there with my video playing on the principal's laptop. And I'm just standing there getting ready for the pure satisfaction of watching their punishment unfold. But instead, he suddenly turns to me, slams his hand on his desk, and goes, do you know how much harassment you've caused for these girls, bro? These girls bullied me for days, but you're telling me I'm the one getting punished for it? And if that wasn't bad enough, that's when he gave me the decision.

My life has been a living hell since they found my channel and it's getting worse every day, all because of one group of girls. Like it started with hate comments and putting pictures in my locker, but the final straw was when they came into school and handed me a T-shirt of my channel asking if I could sign it since I'm so famous. And bro, her friends acted like this was the funniest thing they'd ever seen. But I wasn't gonna just let this slide now.

We're done being your servants, mom announced, slapping a contract on the kitchen table I'd scrubbed an hour ago. This says that you will do exactly 50% of all household chores. Sign it. She started recording on her phone while dad stood behind her, arms crossed. We're exhausted from carrying you. The irony was incredible. I been doing way more than 50% of everything for two years. While they couldn't even tell you where we kept the laundry detergent. Mom hadn't cooked since 2022. Dad hadn't touched a vacuum in forever. Yet they genuinely believe they were doing most of the housework. 50% or find somewhere else to live, dad added, wearing the shirt I'd ironed that morning. I looked at the contract, then at their smug faces, then I signed it with a smile. You're absolutely right, 50% starting tomorrow. I promise I'll never do more than my exact share again. They actually high five each other like they'd just won a free slave in the lottery, realising their problems were about to skyrocket. The next morning, mom was on the phone with her sister at 6:00am, bragging about their breakthrough in parenting. We finally taught him responsibility, she gloated. Kids these days need firm boundaries, dad chimed in from the bathroom. Should have done this years ago. Watch how smooth everything runs now that he knows we mean business. They moved through their morning routine with the confidence of people who never had to think about clean clothes magically appearing in their closets or lunches mysteriously packing themselves. That's when I decided to follow exactly what the contract said. Twenty minutes later, I started the laundry and pulled my clothes out mid cycle, leaving the machine full of soapy water. Dad discovered his work shirts floating in cold gray water at 7:00am, his confident whistling dying mid note as he started screaming from the laundry room. He he missed his critical client meeting trying to dry a shirt with Mom's hair dryer still damp, patches visible during his afternoon presentation. Mom fared no better. She'd assumed her presentation outfit would be clean as always, only to find it buried under a week of their dirty clothes. She did her zoom presentation to corporate in a wrinkled gym shirt, her credibility evaporating as quickly as her promotion chances. By Wednesday, the house reeked, taking out exactly one trash bag, mine, leaving theirs to ferment in the summer heat. When Mom's book club arrived, I watched from my spotless half of the living room as her best friend's face contorted at the smell. We're doing exactly fifty. Fifty now, I explained cheerfully, showing them Mom's recorded contract. She was very insistent about fairness. The women exchanged glances before suddenly remembering other commitments. Mom's smile cracked like old paint. Real collapse came Friday when Dad's boss arrived for dinner. I'd vacuumed exactly Half of each room, leaving a perfect line down the middle like a bizarre art installation. The dining table was set only on my side, where I sat eating takeout while dad frantically tried to explain why half their home looked abandoned. Where's the food? Dad hissed in the kitchen. I only bought my half of groceries. Cooking for others would exceed my share, I called out loud enough for his boss to hear. The man left after 15 minutes muttering about family issues. When they realized they'd messed up, they attempted gaslighting me into going back to how things were. You're being deliberately difficult, mom accused during another family meeting. This isn't what we meant, and you know it. I pulled out my phone, playing back her video from the first meeting. You said, and I quote, exactly 50% of all household chores. No more free rides. I have spreadsheets showing I'm doing precisely 50%. Dad tried a different angle. You're supposed to be mature enough to understand what we really meant. Oh, so you meant I should read your minds instead of following the written contract you made me sign. They went silent, awkwardly avoiding my eyes. They couldn't exactly scold me about doing exactly what they wanted me to do, but their friends started joking about the 50% house. At social gatherings, they cracked. Please just go back to how things were before, mom begged. We didn't realize you were doing so much, dad nodded frantically. We'll Rip up the contract. Just please clean the bathroom properly. My boss is coming for dinner tomorrow. I leaned back in my chair, savoring the moment. Actually, I'm really enjoying this new system. It's given me so much more time for studying, and my grades have never been better. Plus, you were right, 50% is much fairer than what I was doing before. The panic in their eyes was palpable.

I was in Mr Aneta's history class when the announcement came over the intercom. Code Red. Code red. This is not a drill. Everyone froze. We practiced this 100 times. Lock the door. Turn off the lights. Hide in the corner. Mr Grenada immediately jumped up and reached for the door lock. Then Vice Principal Medina's voice boomed through the speaker. False alarm, everyone. Some pranksters called in a fake threat. Continue with your lessons. Do not lock your doors. I repeat, do not initiate lockdown procedures. Mr Grenada hesitated with his hand on the lock. My friend Maddie whispered from her desk. I said, Code Red, that's the real signal. Mr Aneta looked confused. The VP says it's fake, though. Then we heard it, footsteps running down the hallway, not walking, running hard and fast like someone was being chased. Mr Medina's voice came back on. Teachers, I said, continue teaching. Any classroom that locks their door will have their teacher written up for insubordination. Mr Arneta slowly backed away from the door. He looked scared but sat back at it desk. Everyone stay calm. Let's continue with the lesson. Sweat was dripping from his forehead and nobody could focus. The running footsteps kept happening, first on our floor, then above us and back again. pulled out my phone and opened our school's parent Facebook group. My mom had posted that police were surrounding the School. They told us someone called about a weapon. She spammed my phone saying she loves me. My hands started shaking. I showed Maddie the post. Her face went white. She raised her hand. Mr Aneta, my mom says the police are outside. Mr Aneta walked to the window and peeked through the blinds. He gasped loudly. There were six police cars in the parking lot. Mr Medina came on again. Students ignore any social media posts. This is a routine false alarm. Any student caught on their phone will receive immediate suspension. Any teacher who initiates lockdown will be terminated. I saw Mr Aneta's jaw clench. We could hear doors slamming somewhere in the building, not closing, slamming like someone was checking rooms. Then we heard something that made everyone freeze. The fire exit at the end of our hallway opened and slammed shut. Someone was on our floor. Maddie grabbed my arm so tight it hurt. The footsteps were getting closer, classroom by classroom. Mr Grenada stood up and walked toward the door again, but he stopped. He looked at us and at the door and back at us. The footsteps stopped right outside our room. That's when Pete, the quiet kid who never talked, stood up. He grabbed his desk and started dragging it toward the door. Mr Anetta, help me now. Mr Anetta snapped out of it. What are you doing? Pete didn't stop. My dad's a cop, he said. If we ever hear Code Red, We lock down no matter what anyone says, even the principal. The door knob started to turn. Everyone moved at once. Kids grabbed desks and chairs and shoved them against the door. Mr Anetta finally joined us. Lights, someone get the lights. Maddie hit the switch. We pushed everything we could find against that door. The person outside pushed hard. The door opened a crack, but hit our barricade. They put harder. Mr Medina's voice screamed through the intercom, which classroom is refusing to follow directions? You will all be expelled. But we didn't care about his threats anymore. The person outside kicked the door. The whole barricade shook. Some girls started crying. Pete pointed to the back.

Then TikTok picks a song for me and it's Adele's Someone Like You. I was like, wait, what? I literally just woke up, was feeling cute, and TikTok's out here making it seem like I'm going through a breakup or something. So of course I had to try again. This time I took a pic of my cat just sleeping, all peaceful and cozy. Guess what song TikTok gave me? Megan, thee Stallion. Savage. Now my cat's out here being a whole bad bitch. Like what's going on TikTok? My friend tried it too. She took a pic of her breakfast, some toast and eggs, all cute and simple, and TikTok gave her unholy. At this point I'm seriously wondering if this app has psychic powers. It's not just matching songs to photos, it's like reading right through your soul. Now every morning I'm like, okay, what moods TikTok gonna give me today? I snap a pic and wait for the app to tell me how I'm feeling with a song. Y'all gotta try this. Take any pic, let TikTok pick your vibe. Then Come back and tell me what song it gave you. Because honestly, I need to know if I'm the only one getting mind read by TikTok

I stared in shock. What basement? I'm giving birth at the hospital. Oh, honey, Agnes said, reaching across the table to pat my hand. women have been delivering babies at home for five generations. I delivered Brent and his sisters right here in this house. My husband Brent squeezed my shoulder. Mom's delivered over 20 babies for our family. She knows what she's doing. The baby kicked hard against my ribs like it was trying to escape this conversation. We've been living in Brent's childhood home while our house underwent renovations. Not once had anyone mentioned this family tradition. I already have an OB, I said, my voice shaking. We've been planning a hospital birth. I'm high risk because of my blood pressure. Agnes waved her hand dismissively. Hospitals are where people go to die. Your own mother died giving birth in one of those places. The words hit me like a physical blow. My mother had died from complications, my birth. Brad followed me to our bedroom later that night. I was shoving clothes into my overnight bag when he grabbed my wrist. You're overreacting, he said. This is how my family does things. I'm not giving birth in some basement room with your mother playing doctor. His face hardened in a way I've never seen before. If you can't respect our traditions, Then maybe this marriage was a mistake. I froze. You're threatening divorce because I want actual medical care. He showed me our prenup clause 15. In case of divorce due to irreconcilable differences about family values, you forfeit custody rights. My legs went weak. I sank onto the bed. I had no money of my own, no family since my father died last year. Without Brent, I'd lose everything, including my baby. The next weeks became a waking nightmare. Agnes started her preparations, which included drinking foul smelling teas and attending birthing circles with other women from their community. During one session, a woman named Carol pulled me aside. My sister died during one of Agnes's home births five years ago, she whispered. They said it was God's will, but she bled out while Agnes refused to call an ambulance. My blood turned to ice that night. I searched online for anything about the Mitchell family. Three women had died during home births in this county over the past 15 years. Agnes's name was never mentioned, but the address. This were all in this neighborhood. The headache started the following week. My vision blurred and my feet swelled so badly I couldn't wear shoes, classic signs of preclampsia. When I told Agnes, she gave me more herbs and said hospital monitoring would just stress them, baby. She took my phone the next day, said I was reading too many scary stories online. Brent agreed it was for the best. I Waited until Agnes left for her weekly grocery run and snuck to the neighbor's house. I called my old colleague who worked as a labor and delivery nurse. You need to get to a hospital now, she said, after I described my symptoms. You could have a stroke or seizure. The baby could die. I can't, I sobbed. I'll lose custody if I leave. You'll lose your life if you stay. That night at dinner, I showed Brent the information she had texted. For the first time, I saw doubt cross his face. Maybe we should just get you checked, he said quietly, just to be safe. Agnes slammed her hand on the table. Absolutely not. Doubt is what kills mothers and babies. Faith is what saves them. But Brent held firm. We'll go tomorrow morning just for a quick check up. I never made it to morning. The contraction started at 2:00am, five weeks early. Brent ran for his keys, but Agnes had already taken them. She locked the doors from the inside with keys only she had. This is meant to be, she said, only as I doubled over in pain. The baby knows when it's time. Brent pounded on the doors, tried to break windows, but Agnes had prepared for this. Security bars on everything. No phones, no landline in our room. She LED me to the basement where her birthing room waited. Ancient equipment that belonged in a museum, stained sheets, the smell of old blood. Poorly masked by incense. As the contractions intensified, I heard Agnes on an old rotary phone in the corner. Yes, the policy is.

And suddenly it's like musical chairs, but your chair disappeared. Like it's instant. People don't even wait. They already sliding across the room, locking in with their besties, acting like they rehearsed it. And me, I'm just sitting there fake smiling, pretending I'm not slowly panicking inside. You try to play it cool, looking around casually, acting like you're just taking your time. Deep down you're screaming, please, somebody make eye contact with me. And somehow everyone just knows how to avoid you. Like your whole class became trained professionals and not seeing you. It's like they went blind with precision. You shift in your seat a little, do that awkward cough like, hey, I'm still here. Nothing. Then the teacher hits you with the, oh, looks like you don't have a partner. Thanks for announcing it to the entire room, Mrs. Ava. Why not just put me under a spotlight and cue the sad violin while you're at it? And the worst part, the teacher sees it, oh, you don't have a partner. Hmm. Okay, just join that group over there, bro. That group already teamed up, planned the project, probably already gave each other nicknames and now I gotta slide in like the substitute friend. It's always the quiet group too. So now we're all just awkwardly pretending to be okay while not saying a single word at that point. I'm like, you know what, I'll work alone. I'll suffer in silence. At least I don't gotta ask someone if I can use their glue stick. And don't even get me started on when the teacher just assigns you to the one person in class you don't get along with. Now y'all gotta pretend to be civil for 5 minutes while exchanging half hearted ideas and silently judging each other's handwriting.

So I did exactly that and watched her world crumble. She watched me get down on one knee five times and said no every single time. Eight years together. I've been playing husband since year 2. Paying her car note, keeping her on my insurance, covering most of the rent while she found herself through three different careers. She had this whole routine down. Tears in her eyes, hand on her heart. Then some perfectly rehearsed excuse. We're not ready, let's wait till we're more stable. The timing isn't right. Then came proposal No. 5. And she finally showed me who she really was. I'd gone all out this time. I'm convinced myself that maybe the problem was I hadn't made it special enough. I rented out her favorite restaurants, rooftop, hung string lights everywhere, and invited all our friends and family there. The whole production cost me three months salary, but I thought it'd be worth it. When she finally said yes. My girlfriend stood there in the dress I'd bought her, surrounded by everyone we knew. And she didn't even let me finish the speech. Just shook her head with this pitying smile. Like I was a dog that wouldn't stop bringing her the same stick. Back at our apartment that night, I finally broke. Asked her straight up if she loved me. Why did she keep doing this? Her whole face changed in an instant. And the Mask came completely off. It's my choice when I accept a proposal, she said, voice ice cold. You don't get to pressure me with your timeline. You're my boyfriend, so act like one. Stop trying to be my husband when I haven't even accepted your proposal. Know your place. Know my place? After eight years of building a life together, I was supposed to know my place? Those words rewired something in my brain. Eight years of playing husband while she kept me a boyfriend status because it was convenient for her. She wanted me to act like a boyfriend. Fine. I give her exactly what she asked for. But boyfriends don't pay their girlfriends bills. Boyfriends don't share bank accounts. Boyfriends don't sacrifice their futures for someone who won't even wear their ring. I started my new boyfriend only policy the next morning while she was at her yoga class. First, I sold the ring to a dealer for 12 grand, enough to cover what I'd spent on her car this year alone. Then I called Verizon and removed her from my phone plan. By the time she got home from yoga, I changed every password and moved my money from our joint account. Didn't even notice until lunch when her phone died mid phone call. Babe, my phone's not working. She texted from her laptop, annoyed but not worried. Call Verizon. It's being weird. An hour later, they said, I'm not on the account anymore. Then the panic Started creeping in. What did you do? I responded, I'm being your boyfriend and not your husband, just like you said. She actually laughed at first, thinking it was some kind of joke. She came home that night, acting extra sweet. Made my favorite dinner and tried to cuddle on the couch. Okay, you made your point, she said, kissing my neck. I'll think about what you said. Now fix my phone. I moved to the guest bedroom instead. The next morning, she couldn't log into Netflix. Then Hulu died.

Aunt Patricia watched my plate like a hawk. Sweetie, are you sure you need the mashed potatoes and the rice? Then came the clothing comments. That's a brave choice wearing horizontal stripes. You know, dark colors are more slimming. I tried everything. I asked her privately to please stop focusing on my body. I told her it hurt my feelings. I even brought articles about body positivity. She patted my hand and say she was just looking out for me because she loved me. That opened the flood gates. Patricia has a point about portion control. My cousin Jennifer chimed in at Thanksgiving. Have you tried intermittent fasting? I could send you some links. Uncle Rob began his helpful gym advice. You know, muscle burns more calories. My 12 year old nephew started asking if I really needed dessert. Even grandma, sweet grandma, started saying things like, you have such a pretty face. If only my birthday dinner last month was when they took it too far. As I reached for a second slice of my own birthday cake, the entire table collectively sucked in their breath. Aunt Diane actually moved the cake. Go away from me. We're doing this because we love you, she said. Fifteen relatives nodded an agreement. The next family dinner, I came prepared. Aunt Patricia reached for the bread and I gasped. Patricia, carbs after six? That's brave. She froze, hand midair. I kept.

Every Thursday for three years, I told my wife Becca the same thing. I'm going to hang with the boys tonight. Be back around midnight. Truth is, I was driving to the cinema to watch movies alone because I just needed some me time. But then two months ago, my movie ended abruptly, and I came home two hours earlier than planned. When I turned onto our street, there was a black Infinity in our driveway. My heart stopped as I watched back all the footage from our doorbell camera and saw a man getting out of the car and walk. Hang up like he'd done it before. Becca opened. Before he could ring, they kissed. The kind where her hand went to his neck. My stomach dropped. I wanted to burst through that door and confront them, but I decided on the spot that that would be too kind. I need. Needed to do something else. Something that would destroy her. So I drove around until 12:30 and walked in with a story about Tony getting drunk. Becca was showering. Hey, babe. How was your night? Good. You know how it is. Then next two Thursdays, I kept my routine, but park down the street at 8:30 to watch. At the same time, the same car pulled up. I zoomed in on the ring footage, and that's when it hit me. The man was Mark. Mark, who supposedly moved to Seattle. Two years ago, my knees were shaking, but I took screenshots and sent them to my lawyer to further build my case. When I was confident enough that I had everything basically set up, I dropped the bomb. Becca was going on about her fake plans for when I left for Boys Night, when I randomly blurted out, you know who I miss? Mark. That guy and I used to have so much fun before he moved to Seattle. Her fork stopped halfway to her mouth just for a second. Yeah, Mark was great. You guys still text, though, right? Sometimes. The next morning, she woke up different, with this nervous energy. She made some phone calls behind closed doors, and since it was Thursday, during lunch, she texted, what time are you heading out tonight? She never asked before, so I knew. The comment about Mark got her. Probably 7:30. Why? Just wondering. The guys doing anything special? Same old. After work. She was cooking in full makeup. You look nice, I said. Just felt like making an effort for you to come home to. But she kept checking her phone and setting it down, then pick getting it back up at 7:15. She practically pushed me out. Don't want you to be late. Tell everyone I say hi. I drove to my regular spot down the street where I watched them, but this time, there was no car that showed up. And at 9:15, Becca's own car pulled Out. I followed her. First stop, O'malley Sports Bar, where she thought I'd be. She walked in confidently, then came out five minutes later looking confused, checking her phone, scanning the parking lot. Then she got back in her car. Her second stop, the dugout, another sports bar. Through the windows, I watched her walk the entire place, moving table to table, even checking the bathroom entrance area. She showed her phone to a waitress, who shrugged. Back to the car, more frantic phone checking. Third stop, Buffalo Wild Wings. She stayed longer this time, 15 minutes. I could see her at the bar talking to the manager, showing him something on her phone. Probably my pic. He shook his head, pointed to their mostly empty tables. Thursday wasn't exactly Prime Sports Bar night. Fourth stop, the dive bar where Tony actually used to drag us. She went straight to the bartender. I slipped in through the side door, ducked into the hallway by the bathrooms. Heard her say, every Thursday night, group of guys, probably five or six of them, loud. One of them looks like this. The bartender studied her phone. Thursday's our slowest night. I definitely remember a regular group. Sorry. She left looking frustrated, sat in her car for five minutes typing furiously. Then she drove to the A M C. Theater. I gave her a 10 minute head start, then walked in through the side entrance. She was at the concession stand talking to the Teenage manager showed her phone again. He pointed toward the theaters. She went to check each one. Open doors, scanning the sparse Thursday night crowds. I went back to my car. Twenty minutes later, she emerged, looking defeated. Sat in her car for another 10 minutes. Through her rear window, I could see her on the phone, gesturing with her free hand. Probably calling Mark. Probably saying she couldn't find me anywhere. That maybe I knew that Thursday nights might not be safe anymore. She even drove by two more bars on the way home. Quick stops, desperate checks. When I got home at my your time, she was on the couch with wine, trying to look casual, but her leg was bouncing. How was your night? Studying. Guys go. Oh, Malley's. Why? Her jaw clenched. No reason. Just curious. Was it busy? Pretty dead, actually. Who all was there? Haven't heard their names in a while. The usual.

Another kid is making shadow puppets on the wall like it's a Broadway show. And there's always that one kid who forgets to bring anything. No pillow, no blanket, just vibes. He's over there sleeping on the carpet using a hoodie as a mattress. And there's the group that swears they're staying up all night. Big talk at midnight. But by 12:30, half of them are knocked out brutally and the other half are wide awake arguing if aliens are real. And the food situation, wild. You got 10 people fighting over the last slice of pizza like it's a custody battle. Someone's sneaking chips at 4:00am and the crinkle of the bag might as well be a fire alarm. When morning comes, everyone wakes up looking like they've survived a natural disaster. Hair's a mess, someone's missing a sock and the kid who slept on the floor can't walk straight anymore. Best part, parents roll in. Like, so did you guys get some rest? Yeah, sure. If by rest you mean four minutes of sleep and permanent brain damage.

I don't know if anyone else feels this, but it's like I'm never really alone, but I'm never really chosen either. I'm the one people are happy to see in the group, the one they'll talk to if no one else is around, the one that's nice and easy to hang out with. But when it comes down to it, I'm never the person someone calls first. I'm not the best friend, the ride or die, the person they can't wait to text when something happens. I'm just there, always included, never prioritized. It's such a mind fuck because technically I have friends, I'm not isolated, but I still feel invisible. I'll be standing right there laughing with everyone and still feel like an extra in my own life. Like I'm the supporting character in their story, but never the main one in mine. And yeah, it hurts.

Like I don't even think historians are gonna know how to write this down. We literally got two new seasons in one month. An immortal person casually existing, a priest who went to hell and actually threw hands with Satan, radioactive nuclear spiders and then somehow the UK decided to spawn human sized rat. Oh, and the Black Plague made a comeback in 2025. But wait, it gets worse. Aliens are apparently landing in November. Citra out here building a 10 foot tall Terminator, animatronic, the Boo Boo dolls confirmed to be affiliated with the Devil. Ice cream trucks mysteriously appearing again like it's 2006. The iPhone 17 straight up leak. And then Roblox. Bro, Roblox was on another level of insanity. They said he sent an assist letter to SLEP which backfired so hard that SLEP actually clapped back. Roblox stock tanked by $12 billion. He dropped an AI generated apology. Chris Hanson pulled up, law by Mike pulled up and even the state of Louisiana started suing Roblox. Then out of nowhere, the US congressman gets involved. Roblox starts getting banned in countries like Qatar and Indonesia. And both the US and UK governments are now investigating Roblox for safety issues. While all this chaos is happening, creators like kreekraft are leaving the star program. And the best news of all, I got nearly 80,000 people to subscribe to my channel this month. Bro, August wasn't a month, it was An entire Netflix series.

She returned 6 years later to find I'd divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2 3 years, max. Change the locks. She left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation. To our eight year olds, that first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home, and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decision. It's no more walking on eggshells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curveball. Our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year two brought unexpected changes. Without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I've been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd forgotten how to enjoy My children. Year three changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partner ship could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually, she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her bonus mom. Their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes, and tucked them in at night. Year five was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and be being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year six, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward. After three Years of zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from the living room. Through the window, we watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she own

I responded, bros before hoes, but moms before all. And everyone cracked up. Jason didn't smile, though. His face drained of color like I just confessed to murder. He grabbed all his stuff and moved 3 rows up the school bus without a word. Jason, what's wrong? I was just kidding. I called after him, but he wouldn't turn around. That's when I heard it stay. Casey, my girlfriend's best friend, was crying her eyes out in the back row. When I turned to look, her friend whispered urgently in her ear and she glanced at me before crying harder. Okay, hey, that was definitely weird. I started to wonder whether my joke was really that offensive. That's when my phone buzzed. Three missed calls from dad, but there was no signal. And at the red light, I caught the bus driver wiping his eyes in the rearview mirror. In my three years of knowing him, the most emotion he'd shown was mild annoyance when kids left trash on the seats. A cold feeling crept into my stomach. I got up to go talk to Jason, but Missus Unfitzharris blocked the aisle. Sit down. We're moving. I just need to sit down. I'd never heard her voice like that. I sat. But the second we got to the destination, I cornered Jason. Dude, what is going On he backed away. Nothing. I just, I need space, bruh. I was just kidding. I don't know if I'd pick my mom or my girlfriend. Why did you have to tell everyone what I said? Sid appeared out of nowhere and pulled me aside. Our team captain who never said more.

Every Thursday for three years, I told my wife Becca the same thing. I'm going to hang with the boys tonight, be back around midnight. Truth is, I was driving to the cinema to watch movies alone because I just needed some me time. But then two months ago, my movie ended abruptly and I came home two hours earlier than planned. When I turned onto our street, there was a black infinity in our driveway. My heart stopped as I watched back all the footage from our doorbell camera and saw a man getting out of the car and walk hang up like he done it before. Becca opened, before he could ring, they kissed the kind where her hand went to his neck. My stomach dropped. I wanted to burst through that door and confront them, but I decided on the spot that that would be too kind. I need did to do something else, something that would destroy her. So I drove around until 12:30 and walked in with a story about Tony getting drunk. Becca was showering. Hey, babe, how was your night? Good. You know how it is. Then next two Thursdays, I kept my routine but park down the street at 8:30 to watch. At the same time, the same car pulled up. I zoomed in on the ring footage and that's when it hit me. The man was Mark. Mark who supposedly moved to Seattle. Two years ago, my knees were shaking, but I took screenshots and sent them to my lawyer to further build my case. When I was confident enough that I had everything basically set up, I dropped a bomb. Becca was going on about her fake plans for when I left for boys night when I randomly blurted out, you know who I miss? Mark. That guy and I used to have so much fun before he moved to Seattle. Her fork stopped halfway to her mouth just for a second. Yeah, Mark was great. You guys still text though, right? Sometimes. The next morning she woke up different with this nervous energy. She made some phone calls behind closed doors. And since it was Thursday during lunch, she texted, what time are you heading out tonight? She never asked before, so I knew the comment about Mark got her probably 7:30. Why? Just wondering. The guys doing anything special? Same old after work. She was cooking in full makeup. You look nice, I said. Just felt like making an effort for you to come home to. But she kept checking her phone and setting it down, then pick getting it back up at 7:15. She practically pushed me out. Don't want you to be late. Tell everyone I say hi. I drove to my regular spot down the street where I watched them, but this time there was no car that showed up. And at 9:15, Becca's own car pulled Out I followed her. First stop, O'malley Sports Bar, where she thought I'd be. She walked in confidently, then came out five minutes later looking confused, checking her phone, scanning the parking lot. Then she got back in her car. Her second stop, the dugout, another sports bar. Through the windows, I watched her walk the entire place, moving table to table, even checking the bathroom entrance area. She showed her phone to a waitress who shrugged. Back to the car, more frantic phone checking. Third stop, Buffalo Wild Wings. She stayed longer, this time, 15 minutes. I could see her at the bar talking to the manager, showing him something on her phone, probably my pic. He shook his head, pointed to their mostly empty tables. Thursday wasn't exactly prime sports bar night. Fourth stop, the dive bar where Tony actually used to drag us. She went straight to the bartender. I slipped in through the side door, ducked into the hallway by the bathrooms, heard her say every Thursday night, group of guys, probably five or six of them loud. One of them looks like this. The bartender studied her phone. Thursday's our slowest night. I definitely remember a regular group. Sorry. She left looking frustrated, sat in her car for five minutes typing furiously. Then she drove to the a m. C theater. I gave her a 10 minute head start, then walked in through the side entrance. She was at the concession stand talking to the Teenage manager showed her phone again. He pointed toward the theaters. She went to check each one. Open doors, scanning the sparse Thursday night crowds. I went back to my car. 20 minutes later, she emerged looking defeated, sat in her car for another 10 minutes. Through her rear window, I could see her on the phone gesturing with her free hand, probably calling Mark, probably saying she couldn't find me anywhere. That maybe I knew that Thursday nights might not be safe anymore. She even drove by two more bars on the way home. Quick stops, desperate checks. When I got home at my U full time, she was on the couch with wine, trying to look casual, but her leg was bouncing. How was your night? Studying my face. Good. Same as always. Yeah. Where exactly did you guys go? Oh, Malley's. Why? Her jaw clenched. No reason. Just curious. Was it busy? Pretty dead, actually. Who all was there? Haven't heard their names in a while. The usual.

It started when my sister Chloe came home crying because her boyfriend Jake dumped her. She's 25 and I'm 17, but she always acts like she's the victim in every situation. This time was different, though. She kept saying Jake was horrible and cruel. But when I asked what happened, she got all shifty. He said he broke up with her out of nowhere and kicked her out of his apartment. But then she mentioned she still had keys to his place because she forgot to give them back the next day. She left early in the morning and came back with this huge golden retriever. I recognized him immediately. It was Buster, Jake's dog. Jake love that dog more than anything. When his grandpa died last year, Buster was the only thing that helped him through it. I asked Chloe why she had Buster and she got this weird smile on her face. She said Jake didn't deserve to keep him since he broke her heart. Then she said something that made my stomach drop. She told me she was going to take Buster to the vet tomorrow to put him down as payback for what Jake did to her. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. This dog was completely healthy and happy, just confused about being in a new place. Buster kept looking around for Jake and whining by the door. It was heartbreaking. I told Chloe she was being insane and she couldn't just kill someone's dog because she was upset. She laughed and said Jake should have thought about that before he decided to hurt her. Then she said if I told anyone, she'd make sure I regretted it. That night I couldn't sleep, kept thinking about Buster and how scared he must be. Around 2:00am, I heard Chloe on the phone with someone probably making the vet appointment. I knew I had to do something. The next morning, Chloe left for work and told mom she was taking Buster for a walk later. Mom didn't know the whole story. Chloe just said Jake asked her to watch his dog for a few days. As soon as both of them were gone, I called Jake. He picked up on the first ring and sounded terrible. I told him Chloe had Buster and was planning to put him down today. He went completely silent for like 10 seconds, then started freaking out. He said he'd been looking everywhere for Buster and thought maybe he got out somehow. I told Jake to come over now while Chloe was at work. He was at our house in 15 minutes. When he saw Buster, he literally started crying. Buster went crazy with excitement, jumping all over him and licking his face. I opened the door and Jake carried his dog out to his car. Before he left, Jake told me what really happened with Chloe. She Didn't just get dumped. She cheated on him with his best friend, Marcus. When Jake found out, he broke up with her and told her to move out. She stole Buster on her way out and left Jake's spare key on the counter so he thought she was being mature about the breakup. A few hours later, Chloe came home and went straight to look for Buster when she couldn't find him. She started screaming my name. She found me in my room and absolutely lost it. She called me a traitor and said I had no right to interfere in her business. Then mom came home and asked what all the yelling was about. Chloe told her I let some guy steal her dog. She made it sound like I just gave away her pet to a random stranger. Mom looked.

Mom, dad, and my brother. Landon Harper's got that new job, dad was saying. Making good money now. We'll just tell her it's for Mom's surgery. Mom nodded. She gave us 12,000 for the roof last year, no questions asked. My stomach dropped. There was no roof repair. I'd seen the receipts myself. They'd used my money for Landon's gambling debts. How much this time? Mom asked. 50,000, Landon said casually, maybe 60 if we play it right. Tell her the cancer came back. Cancer? They were going to fake cancer to steal from me. I backed away slowly, my mind racing. The cancer scare from two years ago, the one that made me liquidate my retirement fund to pay for experimental. Had that been fake, too? I thought about all the times I'd helped. A car accident that wasn't covered by insurance. Landon's business that needed startup capital. Mom's dental work, Dad's back surgery. $57,000 over five years. All because I thought I was being a good daughter. Every family gathering, they raised me for being so generous. Behind my back, they were laughing at how easy I was to manipulate. I got in my Car and drove straight to the bank. I'd like to close all my accounts, I told the teller. All of them. Miss every single one. And I need cashiers checks for the full amount. documentation of every transaction I've made to these three people over the past five years.

The man was gunned down in front of his wife and daughter. And instead of taking a second to acknowledge how horrifying that is, people are online making memes and throwing around cheap punch lines like his life was entertaining. He wasn't just a political figure on a stage. He was a husband and a father. And his daughter literally watched her dad collapse in front of her. Imagine being that kid one day, scrolling online and seeing thousands of strangers laughing about the worst moment of your life. You don't have to agree with his politics. You don't have to support anything he stood for. But celebrating a man's murder in front of his family isn't some clever protest. It's cruelty. Everyone talks about empathy and compassion until it's someone they disagree with. Then suddenly all that moral high ground disappears and death becomes a punchline. That's not justice. That's just heartlessness disguised as politics. Snoopy.

So I showed her what life looks like when I stop owing her love, effort, and commitment. We've been married eight years. Eight years of working overtime for our house, down payment, canceling plans when she needed me home, spending weekends fixing things to make her life easier. I thought I was being considerate, spirit, offering to set aside work and distractions to focus on us instead of appreciation. I got a sharp, dismissive response. Her tone was cold, almost rehearsed. I don't owe you intimacy, she said, arms crossed, eyes locked on me like she was daring me to challenge her. At first I thought I'd misheard. What does that even mean? I asked, half laughing, half nervous. She didn't flinch. It means exactly what it sounds like. I'm tired of you acting like it's some kind of obligation. Just because we're married doesn't mean I owe you anything. I felt like the ground had been ripped out from under me. Eight years of sacrifices and working myself to exhaustion, and now she was telling me my feelings and needs didn't matter. That the foundation of our marriage, trust in timidity partnership, was apparently optional. The fight didn't last much longer. She walked out, leaving me standing there with my thoughts racing. By morning, my frustration had turned into resolve. If she didn't owe me intimacy, then maybe I didn't owe her the endless sacrifices I've been making.

I showed up in a nice dress, hair done, feeling good about myself. Katie took one look at me and said, oh, honey, you really should have told me you weren't doing makeup. I would have brought my kit. She said it loud enough for everyone to hear, including her fiance's family, who I was meeting for the first time. I felt my face turn red. Her mom even chimed in saying, Katie's right, dear. A little color would really brighten you up. I spent the whole night feeling like everyone was staring at my bare face. Katie kept introducing me as her natural friend with this fake sweet smile. That night I texted my sister about it. She was furious and said Katie was being a total jerk. Then she offered to do my makeup for the wedding since she works at Sephora. I told her no at first because I didn't want to be petty. But she convinced me that looking good wasn't About Katie. It was about me feeling confident. So two weeks before the wedding, my sister and I went shopping. We got everything, foundation, concealer, eyeshadow, palettes, the works. She taught me how to do a full glam look that made my eyes pop and my skin look flawless. We practiced three times until I could do it myself. Morning of Katie's wedding, I woke up at 6:00am to start getting ready. I did my makeup exactly like my sister taught me, then put on this stunning blue dress I've been saving for a special occasion. When I looked in the mirror, I barely recognized myself. I looked amazing. I got to the church early and found my seat.

My husband's friend Kate always had to be the main character in every situation. When someone else had good news, Kate suddenly had better news. At group dinners, she'd hijack any conversation within five minutes. I couldn't stand her, but I put up with it because she and Zach had been friends since college. After my husband and I announced our pregnancy at 12 weeks, things with Kate got really weird. Suddenly, Kate was everywhere we went sporting a small baby bump. She showed up at our favorite brunch spot rubbing her belly. She enrolled in our exact prenatal yoga class. She even switched to our OB practice. Nobody questioned it because these things happen, and women get pregnant at the same time, she posted weekly bump photos on Instagram, and everyone congratulated her just like they did me. Three months in, one of our friends mentioned something strange at a girl's night. She said Kate's belly looked bigger the previous Tuesday at book club than it did at Saturday's barbecue. When she brought it up, Kate burst into tears about how cruel it was to comment on a pregnant woman's body. She went on about water retention and bloating and how pregnant women deal with enough judgment without their friends piling on. Our friend felt terrible and apologized foolishly while the rest of us comforted Kate. After that night, nobody dared mention anything about her appearance again, even though I started noticing her bump size seemed to fluctuate, too. That's when things got uncomfortable. Kate started making comments about how wild it was that we got pregnant around the same time. She'd joke about our babies being best friends, or maybe even more than friends someday. Then the jokes got stranger, like when she said pregnancy Brain made her forget exactly when she conceived and wasn't it funny how close our due dates were? She started showing up at every single appointment Zach and I had, always in the waiting room when we arrived, claiming her appointment was right before or after hours. During our maternity photo shoot at the park, she appeared with her own photographer, saying what a coincidence that she booked the same spot. The photographer later told me Kate had called asking what time we'd be there. Everything exploded at my baby shower. My. My sister threw this beautiful garden party with all our family and friends there to celebrate. Halfway through opening gifts, Kate stood up and clinked her glass to make an announcement. With tears streaming down her face, she placed her hand on her belly and said, I have the most wonderful news to share with everyone. Zack and I are having a baby together! The entire party gasped, and she continued with a huge smile, I know this is unconventional, but isn't it beautiful that our babies will be siblings?

So I just put on a white T-shirt, red pants and pair of sneaker and boom, there you go. Jeff the killer you can get from Shein. Like, bro, nobody is using this crap. I need something scary, not basic and cute. Like bro, how about if I wanna be Iron Man? You're gonna suggest me a plain red T-shirt and call it a day? Like, where's the creativity? Did it just ran away? I remember back then there was costume makeup and a lot of creativity is put into it. But this year is just plain shirt and Jean. Like bro, you ain't giving out outfit ideas, you're giving out what to wear on a regular day. Like bro, when Halloween comes, I better see someone with a costume that is just perfection, not a plain shirt and jeans or at least use makeup. Damn it, did we just enter an era where we turn cute instead of being scary or act like a psychopath so you can get candy? Like, come on, I better not see anyone using this basic idea or I'm going to start questioning about our creativity.

Logan had been complaining for weeks that I hovered too much. When we went out at his company's holiday party, he pulled me aside near the coat check. Listen. Tonight, can you just not be so attached to me? My coworkers think it's weird how you're always by my side. Just mingle on your own. For once, I smiled sweetly. Of course, babe, I'll give you tons of space. Really? You're not upset? Not at all. You want independence at parties? You got it. The party was at this upscale rooftop venue, open bar, DJ, the Works. Logan immediately ditched me to bro out with his work buddies, leaving me by the entrance. Perfect. I walked straight to the bar where his boss, Thomas, was getting drinks. Emily, where's Logan? Oh, he wanted space. Tonight, I'm flying solo. Thomas looked confused at his own company party. He says I'm too clingy, didn't want me cramping his style. Thomas's wife, Diane overheard. He left you alone. How rude. No worries. I'll just entertain myself. And I did. I ended up in a fascinating conversation with the CFO about cryptocurrency. Then the head of HR pulled me into their group to settle a debate about true crime podcasts. I was having a genuinely great time. An hour in, I caught Logan's eye across the room. He was with his bros but kept glancing over As I laughed with his supervisors, then the DJ started playing salsa music. This gorgeous guy from accounting, Javier, asked if I could dance. I'd love to. We tore up that dance floor. Turns out Javier was a semi professional dancer. He spun me, dipped me the whole nine yards. Proud form to watch. Logan appeared suddenly. Hey, maybe we should, oh, am I being too clingy? I asked mid spin. No, I just, great. Then you won't mind if I keep dancing. Javier dipped me dramatically. The crowd cheered. Logan retreated to the bar Downing whiskey with his confused buddies. Later, the CEO's wife pulled me aside. You're Logan's girlfriend. We need to talk. She dragged me to her table full of executives wives. They immediately adopted me, pouring champagne and gossiping about everyone. Logan usually brags about you non stop. One said, where is he? He needed guy time. Apparently I hover. They exchanged looks. Men are idiots, the CEO's wife declared, raising her glass. Toasted to that. Logan kept trying to approach, but every time he got close, someone else would pull me into conversation. His female co workers wanted workout tips. The it guys needed restaurant recommendations. Even the janitor asked for relationship advice. Everyone loved me except Logan who looked increasingly miserable. Then came the speeches. CEO grabbed the mic thanking everyone for their hard work. Special shout out to Emily for bringing such amazing energy tonight. Logan, you're a lucky man. Everyone clapped looking Around for Logan. He was sulking by the bathroom. Where's Logan? The CEO asked into the mic. He wanted space. So when yelled laughter erupted, the CEO's wife grabbed the mic. Well, his loss. Emily's been the life of the party. More cheering. Logan's face went red. Around midnight, the party was winding down. I was.

So my dad has this mouth like a sailor. Every other word out of his mouth is some form of curse word. He drops F bombs at breakfast, calls drivers idiots when we're in the car, and basically swears more than anyone I know. It's been like this my whole life. Last week I'm in the kitchen making a sandwich and I dropped the Mayo jar. It smashes everywhere and I go, oh, shit, not again. Pretty normal reaction. Action, right? Wrong. My dad comes storming in like I just committed murder. Watch your language, young lady. I don't want to hear that garbage coming out of your mouth again. I just stared at him. This is the same guy who stubbed his toe yesterday and yelled son of a bitch, bastard, piece of shit table loud enough for the neighbors to hear. But somehow me saying shit once is crossing the line. Are you serious right now, dad? Dead serious. You're better than that. That's when I got the idea. If you wanted to please my language, fine. But fair is fair. Okay, dad, you're right. Swearing is bad. So let's all stop starting now. Anyone who swears in this house pays $5 into a jar. Family swear tax. He laughed like it was a joke. Sure, honey, whatever makes you happy. I grabbed an empty pickle jar from the recycling and Wrote swear jar on it with a Sharpie, put it right on the kitchen counter where everyone could see it. Day one was amazing. Dad walks into the kitchen that morning, sees the coffee pot is empty.

Every Thursday for three years, I told my wife Becca the same thing. I'm going to hang with the boys tonight. Be back around midnight. Truth is, I was driving to the cinema to watch movies alone because I just needed some me time. But then two months ago, my movie ended abruptly and I came home two hours earlier than planned. When I turned onto our street, there was a black Infinity in our driveway. My heart stopped as I watched back all the footage from our doorbell camera and saw a man getting out of the car and walk. Hang up like he done it before. Becca opened. Before he could ring, they kissed. The kind where her hand went to his neck. My stomach dropped. I wanted to burst through that door and confront them, but I decided on the spot that that would be too kind. Needed to do something else. Something that would destroy her. So I drove around until 12:30 and walked in with a story about Tony getting drunk. Becca was showering. Hey, babe. How was your night? Good. You know how it is. Next two Thursdays, I kept my routine, but park down the street at 8:30 to watch. At the same time, the same car pulled up. I zoomed in on the ring footage, and that's when it hit me. The man was Mark. Mark, who supposedly moved to Seattle two years Ago, my knees were shaking, but I took screenshots and sent them to my lawyer to further build my case. When I was confident enough that I had everything basically set up, I dropped the bomb. Becca was going on about her fake plans for when I left for Boys Night, when I randomly blurted out, you know who I miss? Mark. That guy and I used to have so much fun before he moved to Seattle. Her fork stopped halfway to her mouth just for a second. Yeah, Mark was great. You guys still text, though, right? Sometimes. The next morning, she woke up different, with this nervous energy. She made some phone calls behind closed doors. And since it was Thursday, during lunch, she texted, what time are you heading out tonight? She never asked before, so I knew. The comment about Mark got her. Probably 7:30. Why? Just wondering. The guys doing anything special? Same old. After work. She was cooking in full makeup. You look nice, I said. Just felt like making an effort for you to come home to. But she kept checking her phone and setting it down, then picking it back up. At 7:15, she practically. He pushed me out. Don't want you to be late. Tell everyone I say hi. I drove to my regular spot down the street where I watched them, but this time, there was no car that showed up. And at nine fifteen, becca's own car pulled out. I followed her. First stop, o'malley's sports bar, where she thought i'd be. She walked in confidently, then came out five minutes later looking confused, checking her phone, scanning the parking lot. Then she got back in her car. Her second stop, the dugout, another sports bar. Through the windows, I watched her walk the entire place, moving table to table, even checking the bathroom entrance area. She showed her phone to a waitress, who shrugged. Back to the car, more frantic phone checking. Third stop, Buffalo Wild Wings. She stayed longer this time, 15 minutes. I could see her at the bar talking to the manager, showing him something on her phone, probably my picture. He shook his head, pointed to their mostly empty tables. Thursday wasn't exactly Prime Sports Bar night. Fourth stop, the dive bar where Tony actually used to drag us. She went straight to the bartender. I slipped in through the side door, ducked into the hallway by the bathrooms, heard her say, every Thursday night, group of guys, probably five or six of them, loud. One of them looks like this. The bartender studied her phone. Thursday is our slowest night. I definitely remember a regular group. Sorry. She left looking frustrated, sat in her car for five minutes typing furiously. Then she drove to the AMC theater. I gave her a 10 minute head start, then walk in through the side entrance. She was at the concession stand talking to the teenage manager. Showed her phone again. He pointed toward the theaters. She went to check each one, opening doors, scanning the sparse Thursday night crowds. I went back to my car. Twenty minutes later, she emerged, looking defeated. Sat in her car for another 10 minutes. Through her rear window, I could see her on the phone, gesturing with her free hand. Probably calling Mark. Probably saying she couldn't find me anywhere. That maybe I knew that Thursday nights might not be safe anymore. She even drove by two more bar on the way home. Quick stops, desperate checks. When I got home at my usual time, she was on the couch with. As always. Yeah. Where exactly did you guys go? Oh, Malley's. Why? Her jaw clenched. No reason. Just curious. Was it busy? Pretty dead, actually. Who all was there? Haven't heard their names in a while. The usual.

She returned 6 years later to find I divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years Max. Change the locks. She left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation to our 8 year olds. That first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decision missions. No more walking on eggshells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curve ball our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year 2 brought unexpected changes without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I've been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd forgotten how to Enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partner ship could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught sky to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her Bonus Mom, their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes and tucked them in at night. Year 5 was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. Their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year 6, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward after three years. Of zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp in the living room. Through the window, we watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck, pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she owned the place. Eleanor was packing the twins lunches for.

I was halfway through Saturday morning spin at Cycle Soul Clenching to keep my tampon inside of me when I noticed the blonde girl in front of me facetiming my boyfriend of four years. Can't wait to see you tonight, beautiful, he whispered. I vomited in my mouth. I can't believe we've been dating for three months already. She responded like, hello, Britney. Our instructor who always wore the cutest sets saw me crying and immediately cut her playlist. Hey, hon, are you doing okay? That's my man. I pointed at the screen where Blake was now shirtless making breakfast. The entire studio went silent, 25 girls in coordinating workout sets just staring. The blonde girl immediately hung up and turned around. Wait, girl, I'm so sorry. I swear I didn't know. Every single girl started climbing off their bikes. Someone handed me a liquid IV. Someone else had tissues, the good ones with lotion. Another girl was already fixing my mascara with her emergency makeup kit. Four years, Natalie shrieked. This absolute trash man has been with her for four years. The blonde Isabella looked like she was gonna throw up her green juice. I met him on Bumble and he said he just got out of something casual. Casual. The entire room erupted. They found his Instagram and followed in seconds. The most recent photo was literally a picture of us holding hands by the beach with the caption L O m L this absolute queen with sleeve tattoos and perfect and liner just said call his sister speaker now my hands were shaking as I found Ellie's contact. She spoke first hey babe how's been? Did you try that new protein smoothie place? After Ellie my voice voice cracked Blake's facetiming another girl they've been together for three months the silence was louder than when a boy starts showing you his camera roll on the first date girl, don't play are you being effing for real right now? I turned on Facetime and showed myself crying my eyes out and that's when she started shouting I'm getting my mom and we're coming right now don't effing move she hung up and I just stared at my phone like okay, Ellie kind of ate oh, this is about to be good someone whispered Isabella and I were clutching each other's hands neither of us blaming each other the entire class was hyping me up and telling me I deserve better teenager in the corner came up to me and said girl even while crying your skin is glowing let that crusty man go back to picking girls who are actually in his league the class leader Bethany shouted your hot girl era starts now now even the quiet girl said girl you were really gonna give that receding hairline your best years that one made me laugh and y'all when that door flew open it was like Real Housewives Met Crazy Rich Asians. Ellie strutted in with her Balenciaga bag. Mrs. A. Leek in her Saturday costar fit but make it fashion. Her Aunt Linda, who I didn't even know was coming, had her Cartier sunglasses on indoors. Where is she? Mrs. Leek's voice could have cut diamonds. She saw me, saw Isabella. I watched her perfectly microbladed brows go through the five stages of grief in real time. Ellie, call your brother now, mom. Maybe we should now. The way Ellie's acrylics clicked on her phone screen was aggressive. What? Blake's annoyed voice came through the speaker. Get your butt down to cycle soul.

When I turned 15, my mom went from strict to straight up paranoid. One night after dinner, she plopped down next to me with this weird smile and said she was installing a family safety app on my phone. I watched her tap away, giving herself access to everything. My location, photos, texts, even my drafts on social media. It's just to keep you safe, honey, she said, handing my phone back like nothing had changed. But everything had changed. It felt like having a stalker who lived in my house. At first I tried to be cool about it. Maybe it would calm her down, right? Wrong. Things got insane fast. She text me in the middle of conversations asking who I was with. Comment on memes I haven't even posted yet because she was reading my drafts. The worst part? She started replying to my friends pretending to be me. My buddy Jake texted asking if I wanted to hang out, and my mom replied, sure. Sure thing, buddy! With way too many exclamation points. Jake called me laughing, asking why I was texting like a soccer mom. I had no idea what he meant until I checked my messages. Then came the day that broke me. I was in history class when Mrs. Wilson pulled me aside. Looked uncomfortable as hell. Liam, your mother called the school. She's concerned about some message you sent about Me. My stomach dropped. I knew exactly what she meant. I texted my best friend Kyle the night before, joking about how our history teacher's haircut looked like she stuck her finger in an electrical socket. It was just good friend stuff, not meant for anyone else. But my mom had read it and called the school to complain about my private joke. I wanted to disappear into the floor. By lunch, Kyle wasn't talking to me. Neither was Jake. Word got around that my mom was reading everything, and suddenly nobody wanted to text me anymore. Some kids even blocked me. It was like my social life had a disease. And the disease was my mom. That night, I stared at my phone, feeling trapped. But then I noticed something. The tracking app worked both ways. It log every time someone access the account. I spent hours studying those logs, and what I found made my skin crawl. My mom wasn't just checking my phone during the day. She was logging in 1 a m, 2 a m, even 3 a m. She was forwarding my messages to her laptop. She was screenshotting my photos. She was living inside my phone 24 7. So I came up with a plan. I created a fake friend named Daniel, made up this whole persona, gave him a backstory. Even found some random photos online to use as his profile pic on a group chat with myself.

Logan had been complaining for weeks that I hovered too much. When we went out at his company's holiday party, he pulled me aside near the coat check. Listen. Tonight, can you just not be so attached to me? My coworkers think it's weird how you're always by my side. Just mingle on your own. For once, I smiled sweetly. Of course, babe, I'll give you tons of space. Really? You're not upset? Not at all. You want independence at parties? You got it. The party was at this upscale rooftop venue, open bar, DJ, the Works. Logan immediately ditched me to bro out with his work buddies, leaving me by the entrance. Perfect. I walked straight to the bar where his boss, Thomas, was getting drinks. Emily, where's Logan? Oh, he wanted space. Tonight, I'm flying solo. Thomas looked confused at his own company party. He says I'm too clingy, didn't want me cramping his style. Thomas's wife, Diane overheard. He left you alone. How rude. No worries. I'll just entertain myself. And I did. I ended up in a fascinating conversation with the CFO about cryptocurrency. Then the head of HR pulled me into their group to settle a debate about true crime podcasts. I was having a genuinely great time. An hour in, I caught Logan's eye across the room. He was with his bros but kept glancing over As I laughed with his supervisors, then the DJ started playing salsa music. This gorgeous guy from accounting, Javier, asked if I could dance. I'd love to. We tore up that dance floor. Turns out Javier was a semi professional dancer. He spun me, dipped me the whole nine yards. Proud form to watch. Logan appeared suddenly. Hey, maybe we should, oh, am I being too clingy? I asked mid spin. No, I just, great. Then you won't mind if I keep dancing. Javier dipped me dramatically. The crowd cheered. Logan retreated to the bar Downing whiskey with his confused buddies. Later, the CEO's wife pulled me aside. You're Logan's girlfriend. We need to talk. She dragged me to her table full of executives wives. They immediately adopted me, pouring champagne and gossiping about everyone. Logan usually brags about you non stop. One said, where is he? He needed guy time. Apparently I hover. They exchanged looks. Men are idiots, the CEO's wife declared, raising her glass. Toasted to that. Logan kept trying to approach, but every time he got close, someone else would pull me into conversation. His female co workers wanted workout tips. The it guys needed restaurant recommendations. Even the janitor asked for relationship advice. Everyone loved me except Logan who looked increasingly miserable. Then came the speeches. CEO grabbed the mic thanking everyone for their hard work. Special shout out to Emily for bringing such amazing energy tonight. Logan, you're a lucky man. Everyone clapped looking Around for Logan. He was sulking by the bathroom. Where's Logan? The CEO asked into the mic. He wanted space. So when yelled laughter erupted, the CEO's wife grabbed the mic. Well, his loss. Emily's been the life of the party. More cheering. Logan's face went red. Around midnight, the party was winding down. I was.

The school just outside of Denver had more than 100 police officers rushed to the scene after reports of violence broke out on campus. Right now, three students in, including the suspect, are in critical condition at the hospital. What's even more shocking is that officials aren't even sure if the suspect was old enough to drive. One student who was just eating his lunch outside said the only thought that ran through his head was, no way this is happening. This feels one in a million. It's such a heartbreaking situation.

There has been a school shooting in Denver. A girl got stabbed on the subway and no one helped her. A decomposing body found in D4V D's car. A man was beheaded at Dallas motel. Charlie Kirk getting shot and killed at a university. And all on top of that, the 9 11 was 24 years ago today. As much as I hate Charlie Kirk and his decisions, no one deserves to get killed. Imagine what his wife and kids are feeling right now. His children can't grow up with their dad. His wife is now a single parent. I genuinely hate Charlie, but I can't imagine how his family is handling this right now. And apparently they witnessed it. The way the blood came out of his neck was genuinely traumatizing. The way his body went limp immediately was horrifying. But anyways, moving on to the D4 V D situation. He's been on tour for like what, a month now? He hasn't been in LA for like a month. And the body hadn't decomposed enough for it to be in that car for so long. The body was in there for three days, and the police haven't even made him a suspect. And plus he had a concert like yesterday, I'm pretty sure. But yeah, moving on to the girl that was stabbed. She was literally minding her business before she got stabbed. And as soon as she got stabbed, everyone was So calm. Like, hello, she needs help. There was literal blood dripping on the floor. I don't have much information on the other situations, but the fact that this is all happened in a week is honestly scary. Like, this month has just started. What's going on

It started when my sister Chloe came home crying because her boyfriend Jake dumped her. She's 25 and I'm 17, but she always acts like she's the victim in every situation. This time was different, though. She kept saying Jake was horrible and cruel. But when I asked what happened, she got all shifty. He said he broke up with her out of nowhere and kicked her out of his apartment. But then she mentioned she still had keys to his place because she forgot to give them back the next day. She left early in the morning and came back with this huge golden retriever. I recognized him immediately. It was Buster, Jake's dog. Jake love that dog more than anything. When his grandpa died last year, Buster was the only thing that helped him through it. I asked Chloe why she had Buster and she got this weird smile on her face. She said Jake didn't deserve to keep him since he broke her heart. Then she said something that made my stomach drop. She told me she was going to take Buster to the vet tomorrow to put him down as payback for what Jake did to her. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. This dog was completely healthy and happy, just confused about being in a new place. Buster kept looking around for Jake and whining by the door. It was heartbreaking. I told Chloe she was being insane and she couldn't just kill someone's dog because she was upset. She laughed and said Jake should have thought about that before he decided to hurt her. Then she said if I told anyone, she'd make sure I regretted it. That night I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about Buster and how scared he must be. Around 2:00am, I heard Chloe on the phone with someone probably making the vet appointment. I knew I had to do something. Then next morning, Chloe left for work and told mom she was taking Buster for a walk later. Mom didn't know the whole story. Chloe just said Jake asked her to watch his dog for a few days. As soon as both then were gone, I called Jake. He picked up on the first ring and sounded terrible. I told him Chloe had Buster and was planning to put him down today. He went completely silent for like 10 seconds, then started freaking out. He said he'd been looking everywhere for Buster and thought maybe he got out somehow. I told Jake to come over now while Chloe was at work. He was at our house in 15 minutes. When he saw Buster, he literally started crying. Buster went crazy with excitement, jumping all over him and licking his face. I opened the door and Jake carried his dog out to his car. Before he left, Jake told me what really happened with Chloe. She Didn't just get dumped. She cheated on him with his best friend, Marcus. When Jake found out, he broke up with her and told her to move out. She stole Buster on her way out and left Jake's spare key on the counter so he thought she was being mature about the breakup. A few hours later, Chloe came home and went straight to look for Buster when she couldn't find him. She started screaming my name. She found me in my room and absolutely lost it. She called me a traitor and said I had no right to interfere in her business. Then mom came home and asked what all the yelling was about. Chloe told her I let some guy steal her dog. She made it sound like I just gave away her pet to a random stranger. Mom looked.

So I did exactly that and watched her world crumble. She watched me get down on one knee five times and said no every single time. Eight years together, I've been playing husband since year two, paying her car note, keeping her on my insurance, covering most of the rent while she found herself through three different careers. She had this whole routine down, tears in her eyes, hand on her heart, then some perfectly rehearsed excuse, we're not ready. Let's wait till we're more stable. Timing isn't right. Then came proposal No. 5, and she finally showed me who she really was. I'd gone all out this time, convinced myself that maybe the problem was I hadn't made it special enough. I rented out her favorite restaurants, rooftop, hung string lights everywhere and invited all our friends and family there. The whole production cost me three months salary, but I thought it'd be worth it when she finally said yes. My girlfriend stood there in the dress I'd bought her, surrounded by everyone we knew, and she didn't even let me finish the speech, just shook her head with this pitying smile like I was a dog that wouldn't stop bringing her the same stick. Back at our apartment that night, I finally broke, asked her straight up if she loved me. Why did she keep doing this? Her whole face changed in an instant and the mask came. Completely off. It's my choice when I accept a proposal, she said. Voice ice cold. You don't get to pressure me with your timeline. You're my boyfriend, so act like one. Stop trying to be my husband when I haven't even accepted your proposal. Know your place. No, my place. After eight years of building a life together, I was supposed to know my place. Those words rewired something in my brain. Eight years of playing husband while she kept me a boyfriend status because it was convenient for her. She wanted me to act like a boyfriend. Fine. I give her exactly what she asked for. But boyfriends don't pay their girlfriends bills. Boyfriends don't share bank accounts. Boyfriends don't sacrifice their futures for someone who won't even wear their ring. I started my new boyfriend only poly see the next morning while she was at her yoga class. First, I sold the ring to a dealer for 12 grand, enough to cover what I spent on her car this year alone. Then I called Verizon and removed her from my phone plan. By the time she got home from yoga, I changed every password and moved my money from our joint account. She didn't even notice until lunch when her phone died mid phone call. Babe, my phone's not working, she texted from her laptop, annoyed but not worried. Call Verizon. It's being weird. An hour later, they said I'm not on the account anymore. Then the panic. Started creeping in. What did you do? I responded, I'm being your boyfriend and not your husband, just like you said. She actually laughed at first, thinking it was some kind of joke. She came home that night acting extra sweet. Made my favorite dinner and tried to cuddle on the couch. Okay, you made your point, she said. Kissing my neck. I'll think about what you said. Now fix my phone. I moved to the guest bedroom instead. The next morning, she couldn't log into Netflix. Then Hulu died.

It was 2:00am on a Tuesday and I had work in the morning. But this kid next door had been screaming for three straight hours. Not just normal baby crying, but these gut wrenching wails that made my skin crawl. I tried putting pillows over my head, closing all my windows, even playing loud music through my headphones. Nothing worked. Never met my neighbours properly. They'd moved in about six months ago. This young couple with a baby. The guy seemed okay, always nodded when he saw me getting my mail. The woman looked exhausted every time I saw her, which honestly didn't seem that weird since new parents always look like zombies. But this crying was different. It wasn't stopping and it was getting worse. Around 2:00am, I heard what sounded like furniture being moved around violently. Then a woman's voice shouting something I couldn't make out. That's when I started getting worried. I walked to my window that faced their apartment and tried to see what was going on. Their blinds were mostly closed. I could see shadows moving around frantically. The baby was still screaming, but now it sounded muffled, like someone had closed a door or something. I debated for like 20 minutes whether to call the cops. I mean, what if it was nothing? What if they were just having a rough night and I was being that annoying neighbour Who calls the police over everything? But something felt really wrong. The way the woman had screamed, the furniture noises. Now the baby sounded different, more desperate. So I called 9 1 1. The operator asked me what my emergency was, and I felt stupid saying it, but I told her I thought something might be wrong next door because a baby had been crying for hours and I heard what sounded like a fight. She said they'd send someone to do a welfare check. I figured they'd knock on the door, see that everything was fine, and I'd probably never make eye contact with my neighbors again out of embarrassment.

He brought flowers for my mom, asked my dad about his woodworking hobby, and somehow knew my grandmother collected vintage tea cups because I'd mentioned it once when building the fake story.

How do you tell someone you caught feelings for a fake relationship? Everything changed at Christmas dinner. My aunt announced she'd been looking at wedding venues for us, that she found the perfect place for next fall. Daniel laughed it off perfectly, made some joke about her getting ahead of herself. But later that night, he texted me. We can't keep this up forever, you know? That message hit me like a truck. I realized he was ready to end this whole thing. And I wasn't. Not even close. Instead of texting back or Giving him some weird speech. I invited him over for dinner at my place. Cooked his favorite pasta dish. The one my mom always made. When he came over the table with actual candles, not just the overhead light. After we finished eating, I was washing dishes and he was drying them. Just like we did at my parents house. That's when I finally said it. I know this.

But every time I opened my mouth, nothing came out. How do you tell someone you caught feelings for a fake relationship? Everything changed at Christmas dinner. My aunt announced she'd been looking at wedding venues for us, that she found the perfect place for next fall. Daniel laughed it off perfectly, made some joke about her getting ahead of herself. But later that night, he texted me, we can't keep this up forever. You know, that message hit me like a truck. I realized he was ready to end this whole thing and I wasn't, not even close. Instead of texting back or Giving him some weird speech. I invited him over for dinner at my place, cooked his favorite pasta dish, the one my mom always made when he came over the table with actual candles, not just the overhead light. After we finished eating, I was washing dishes and he was drying them, just like we did at my parents house. That's when I finally said it. I know this.

It was 2:00am on a Tuesday and I had work in the morning. But this kid next door had been screaming for three straight hours. Not just normal baby crying, but these gut wrenching wails that made my skin crawl. I tried putting pillows over my head, closing all my windows, even playing loud music through my headphones. Nothing worked. Never met my neighbours properly. They'd moved in about six months ago. This young couple with a baby. The guy seemed okay, always nodded when he saw me getting my mail. The woman looked exhausted every time I saw her, which honestly didn't seem that weird since new parents always look like zombies. But this crying was different. It wasn't stopping and it was getting worse. Around 2:00am, I heard what sounded like furniture being moved around violently. Then a woman's voice shouting something I couldn't make out. That's when I started getting worried. I walked to my window that faced their apartment and tried to see what was going on. Their blinds were mostly closed. I could see shadows moving around frantically. The baby was still screaming, but now it sounded muffled, like someone had closed a door or something. I debated for like 20 minutes whether to call the cops. I mean, what if it was nothing? What if they were just having a rough night and I was being that annoying neighbour Who calls the police over everything? But something felt really wrong. The way the woman had screamed, the furniture noises. Now the baby sounded different, more desperate. So I called 9 1 1. The operator asked me what my emergency was, and I felt stupid saying it, but I told her I thought something might be wrong next door because a baby had been crying for hours and I heard what sounded like a fight. She said they'd send someone to do a welfare check. I figured they'd knock on the door, see that everything was fine, and I'd probably never make eye contact with my neighbors again out of embarrassment.

I mean, in just Virginia alone, over 80 kids have been kidnapped in just the past two weeks. I mean, that comes out to about six or seven kidnappings per day. What the fuck is going on? I mean, more importantly, who the fuck is kidnapping all these kids? I mean, fuck, they must have turned the flash into a child predator. And it's not even just the flash. I mean, this motherfucker had to have teamed up with fucking bad, man. Like, there's no way these kids are disappearing this fast and without a trace. Now, a growing theory right now is that ice cream trucks are being used to kidnap these kids. Now if you just look it up in the TikTok search bar or just online in general, you'll see a bunch of videos of ice cream trucks recently being just a no, too suspicious. I mean, there's videos surfacing right now of ice cream trucks being out as late as eleven PM. An ice cream truck at night? Yeah, uh, no thanks. I choose life. I'm gonna be honest though, if ice cream trucks are actually being used to kidnap these children, I mean, it's just natural fucking selection at this point. I mean, we are in the big 2025. I mean, who in their right fucking mind is still going up to ice Cream trucks, especially at night time. It's like, come on, buddy, is your fucking brain located in your fucking ass? I will say, though, I was driving to my friend's house the other night, and I saw a suspicious ice cream truck on the way there, and, you know, I didn't. I didn't really think anything of it. Then on the drive home around 10 p m, I saw another, and I still didn't really think anything of it. Then I saw another, and I was like, okay, what in the true crime documentary is going on right here? Let me know what you guys think is happening in the comment section and if you think the ice cream trucks are actually the ones taking these kids.

She returned 6 years later to find I divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years Max. Don't change the locks. He left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation to our 8 year olds. That first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decisions. No more walking on eggs shells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curve ball in our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year 2 brought unexpected changes without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I've been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd forgotten How to enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake cookies and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her Bonus Mom, their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes and tuck them in at night. Year 5 was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year 6, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward after Three years of zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from the living room. Through the window, we watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck, pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she owned the plate.

I slammed on the brakes and jumped out of my car. Nora, baby, what are you doing out here? She was shivering violently and just her school clothes, no coat, tears frozen on her little cheeks. Daddy locked me out. He said. I can't come back until you get home from work. My heart dropped. It was 9 p. M. On a Friday. Jonathan knew I always worked late on Fridays. This wasn't an accident. How long have you been out here? Since you left this morning, she whispered. I scooped her up feeling how ice cold her little body was and carried her toward our front door. It was locked. I used my key, Fury building with every step. I found Jonathan exactly where I expected, sprawled on the couch in his boxers and T-shirt, controller in hand, playing call of duty. The heat was cranked up to 75 degrees. Empty beer cans littered the coffee table. Why was our daughter outside for 12 hours? I tried to keep my voice calm. He didn't even pause his game. She spilled grape juice on my new controller this morning. I told her actions have consequences. I stared at him in disbelief. She's 6 years old, Jonathan. She spilled juice accidentally and you left her outside to freeze? Maybe next time she'll be more careful around my stuff. That's when I noticed Nora's pink backpack sitting by the front door. It was stuffed full, bulging at the seams. Her favorite stuffed bunny was sticking out the top. What's this? I pointed at the bag. Jonathan finally paused his game and turned to look at me. There was something cold in his eyes I'd never seen before. I've been doing a lot of thinking today. While she was outside, he said slowly, this whole family thing isn't working out for me, nor is too much work, too expensive, too loud. And honestly, I never wanted kids in the first place. The room started spinning. What are you talking about? I'm talking about you taking her and leaving tonight. I already had the locks changed while you were at work. You just got lucky I hadn't switched them out yet. I felt like I was in a nightmare. You're abandoning your own daughter. Nora was still clinging to me, her wet clothes soaking through my work blazer. She was listening to every word, her big brown eyes darting between us. Here's the thing. Jonathan stood up thing like this was all perfectly normal. She's not really mine anyway. I mean, yeah, biologically, whatever, but I never signed up for this dad life. You can have her. The casual cruelty in his voice made me sick. This was the man I've been married to for eight years, the man who used to read Nora bedtime stories. Jonathan, she's your daughter. You can't just watch me. He picked up phone. I already talked to my buddy Steven, who's a lawyer. Apparently if I just voluntarily give up my parental rights, I don't have to pay child support either. Win, win. My hands started shaking, but not from fear, from rage. I pulled out my phone and speed dialed a number I'd hoped I'd never have to use. Hi, Christine. It's Caroline. Remember that emergency custody documentation we discussed months ago? File everything Tonight. Jonathan's controller slipped from his hands. What are you doing? What you should have expected when you decided to mess with my daughter. I hit another number.

My ex boyfriend kept harassing me for months after we broke up, showing up at my work and following me home. I filed restraining orders, changed my locks, even moved apartments, but nothing worked. The police said they couldn't do much unless he actually hurt me. I was terrified and felt completely helpless. My friends kept telling me to get a security system, but I was already broke from moving apartments twice. I was working double shifts just to afford the new place. And I thought maybe he'd finally give up and leave me alone. Free car that drove by made my heart race. He would leave flowers on my car with creepy notes about how we belong together. Sometimes I'd find him sitting in the parking lot of my apartment complex just watching my windows. Started using different routes to work and shopping at stores across town. But he always seemed to find me somehow. My co workers had to walk me to my car every night. One night around 2 a. M. I heard someone trying to break into my new apartment. I grabbed my phone and hid in my closet. Heart racing through the crack in the door. I could see it was him. He was drunk and stumbling around, knocking over furniture and screaming my name. I was shaking so bad I could barely dial 9, 1 1. He was saying the most horrible things about what he was Going to do to me. I could smell the alcohol from across the room and he kept bumping into walls like he could barely stand up. I remember thinking this was it. He was finally drunk enough to actually hurt me and there was nowhere left to run. I could hear him breaking picture frames and throwing things around. While I was whispering to the dispatcher, I heard him in my kitchen going through my drawers. I was slamming them open and closed looking for something. Then I heard the worst sound possible. He found my knife set. He started yelling about how if he couldn't have me, nobody could. I thought I was going to die in that closet. The 9 1 1 operator told me to stay hidden and keep the line open. She kept asking if I had another way out. But my apartment was on the third floor. I could hear him getting closer to my bedroom and I was praying the police would get there in time. Then suddenly everything went quiet. No footsteps, no yelling, nothing. I thought maybe he was trying to trick me into coming out. This silence was almost worse than the screaming because I had no idea where he was or what he was planning. I held my breath and pressed my ear to the closet door trying to hear anything. My hands were cramping from gripping my phone so tight. After what felt like forever, I heard him screaming. And.

I spent 3 hours cooking her favorite meal for our anniversary, set up candles, even dug out that playlist from our first date. When she walked through the door with her sister and best friend, she took one look at the setup, rolled her eyes and said loud enough for everyone to hear, stop trying to be romantic. It's pathetic. Pathetic. You look desperate. Then she turned to her friends. This is exactly what I was telling you about. He does this needy stuff constantly. The room went dead silent. Her sister looked uncomfortable. Her best friend stared at the floor. I stood there holding wine, watching my wife destroy our marriage with one sentence. I at the wine down, looked her straight in the eye and said, you know what, you're absolutely right. She expected me to apologize, to scramble. Instead, I started blowing out the candles. What are you doing? She asked, losing that confident edge. Stopping, I replied, gathering the flowers. Romance is pathetic when it's one sided. So I'm done being pathetic. I tossed the flowers in the trash and ordered pizza. We can eat like roommates from now on, pepperoni or cheese. That night she tried damage control, talking about bad days, overreacting. But something had shifted in me. I heard You perfectly, I told her. Message received. No more romantic gestures, no more pathetic be behavior. She laughed it off. Maybe we both need to be more realistic about what marriage actually is. Those words would haunt her the next.

My parents hung metal bars across our bedroom ceilings when I was 9 and made us wrap our legs around them to sleep upside down like bats because they believed gravity was poisoning our brains. Mom and dad had joined this group that taught gravity pulled toxins into your skull while you slept normally. The leader said humans were meant to hang like our ancestors who lived in trees. They came home from the first meeting with construction equipment and spent all night installing bars strong enough to hold our weight. Dad tested each one by hanging from it himself, timing how long before his face turned purple. The first night was torture. They showed us how to hook our knees over the bars and cross our ankles for security. My little brother cried until he threw up, which looked terrifying coming out upside down. Mom just cleaned it up and rehung him. She said our bodies needed time to remember their natural position. Blood rushed to my head until I thought my eyes would explode. But they padlocked our door and removed the regular bed, so we had no choice. After a week, we Learned to sleep in short bursts before the headaches got too bad. Then mom decided we weren't hanging long enough. She installed timer locks on our knee hooks that wouldn't release for eight hours if we needed the bathroom too bad. She gave us adult diapers and Said our ancestors didn't climb down from trees for every little thing. My sister developed constant nosebleeds from the pressure, but dad said that was just toxins leaving her brain. School was impossible when we kept falling asleep at our desks from exhaustion. The nurse called home about the rope burns on our legs and the burst blood vessels in our eyes. Mom withdrew us for homeschooling, saying traditional education was poisoning us with right side up thinking. She hung bars in every room so we could practice proper positioning all day. Even meals happened upside down with special straws and tubes so we could eat without choking. I tried sleeping on the floor one night, but dad had installed motion sensors alarms screamed until they found me and rehung me with zip ties instead of the timer locks as punishment. The ties cut off circulation and my feet turned blue. They only cut me down when I started convulsing. Mom said I was having a gravity detox seizure and hung me right back up with looser ties. My brother figured out he could unhook one leg at a time and rotate to prevent the worst pain. But mom caught him and decided he needed stronger treatment. She ordered special boots that locked onto the bars and couldn't be removed without a key. The boots were so heavy, they stretched our knee joints backwards. He screamed for hours until his voice gave out. Then they got boots for all of Us. The group leader visited to check our progress and said we weren't inverting young enough. He had a Newborn daughter who'd been hanging since birth and never experienced gravity poisoning. Mom got pregnant immediately just to prove she could raise a properly inverted baby. She hung upside down her entire pregnancy. When my new sister was born, they hung a tiny bar in her crib with special harnesses. She never Learned to crawl normally, just swung bar to bar like they wanted. Then I found Dad's laptop open to the group's private forum. The leader was selling our progress photos to medical fetish sites. Hundreds of pictures of us hanging, unconscious, bleeding, crying. Members paid extra for video of our detox seizures. The leader used the money to build a compound where families could live fully inverted. Dad had already put down a deposit. I printed everything and

My girlfriend, Molly, put her hand under my desk. And please, Mrs. Dodson, you have to legally let us go. Mrs. High Dodson was crying now with mascara running down her cheeks. I'm sorry, but if I let you all run out of the class, the gunman might get you. We need to wait. I looked at Molly and tried to keep my voice steady. Don't worry, babe, I'm going to figure out a way out of this. Missus Dodson had kept our entire class trapped in the room. She's been acting strange all week, but today she locked the door during last period because she sensed a warning. Missus Dodson suddenly screamed and pointed at the door there. Did you hear those gunshots? Everyone get down. We all looked at each other confused, but Missus Dodson was shaking and clutching a rosary to her chest. She heard it all 20 of us to the back corner of the room furthest from the windows. She started praying in Latin while we huddled together. Some kids were crying. Others were texting their parents frantically. The school had probably already called wondering where we were. Basketball practice had started two hours ago. Drama rehearsal was happening without half the cast. Missus Dotson, I have an idea, I said, interrupting her prayer. How about you let us out through the window since we're only on the First floor and we can all escape and get help. She shook her head violently. No, the government has friends outside. They'll shoot all of you the second you climb out. I won't let you leave. He started going around hugging each student and telling them she loved them. Kids were flinching away from her touch. This woman who usually graded papers with perfect posture was now wild eyed and sweating through her cardigan. Bradley was a class troublemaker who usually slept through lessons. He stood up and crossed his arms. Missus Dodson, you're so insane that you make me want to actually do my homework. Let us out, you crazy witch. School dismissal was four hours ago. Her face twisted into something ugly. The only dismissal you're going to have is straight to hell. I should let you out of the classroom and let the gunman unload on you. Fine, then let's do it. Bradley walked toward the door. Missus Dodson immediately crumbled. I'm sorry, sweetie. You know I can't let you leave here. I have to keep the door locked so I can protect you all. While she was focused on Bradley and trying to pull him back to the group, I saw my chance. Keys were hanging from her belt loop. I carefully reached over and unclip them, trying not to jingle the metal. Molly saw what I was doing and created more distraction by fake crying loudly. I crawled toward the door, staying low like we Were actually in danger. I didn't realize till later that we really were. My hands were shaking as I found the right key. Lock clicked open and I yanked the door handle. Run, I shouted. All 20 students rushed for the door at once. Missus Dodson screamed and tried to grab people, but we pushed past her. We ran down the hallway and burst through the front entrance into the parking lot where police cars were everywhere. The cops had their hands on their weapons until they saw it was just a bunch of terrified teenagers. They immediately asked us what happened. Our teacher went insane and trapped us in there for four hours. I told the nearest officer. He nodded grimly. We're sorry we took so long. We just got the call about you guys. After we searched in Missus Dodson's house, you won't believe what we found, the officer pulled out a small notebook from his chest pocket and his face got even more serious than before. He started writing something down while shaking his head slowly. And I could see other cops behind him talking into their radios about something urgent. My legs were still shaking from running out of the building, this cop was making it worse with whatever he wasn't telling us yet. He looked up from his note.

Okay, is this true, Robert? Is this girl using you? I mean, no, I don't think so, bro. How much money has she borrowed from you in the past three months? I mean, no, no, no. Forget that. How much is in the past week? Has she even paid you back? Dude, she's my girlfriend. I'm gonna spend money on her, you know? I mean, I'm gonna take her shopping and stuff. Yeah. Is that all that this is about, Jason? Is he spends too much money on her? Uh, no. I understand that you're gonna take your girlfriend out to dinner and shopping and things like that, but, uh, I mean, first of all, he shouldn't be paying her rent. And second of all, she shouldn't be cheating on you. She shouldn't be cheating on you. No, exactly. That's really what we're calling to find out, is if she's cheating on him. You know, if she's loyal to him and he feels like spending all his money on her, what are you gonna do? That's. That's his prerogative. Right, but if she's cheating on him, at least Jason hopes this will open Robert's eyes a little bit. So we are about to call Steph, okay, the girlfriend, and we are going to play this stupid voice Scotty of the balls. Silly voice of the naked game. I love it! I love it. Good, then give me some dialing music. I'd ask you all to please be quiet until we begin the naked game here on Scotty the ball. Hello? Hey, good morning. Is this Steph? I'm sorry, what? I said. I said, is this Steph? Yes, who is this? Steph, this is Scotty and the buzz from 98.6 FM. Scotty and the Buzz Morning Show. How are you today? Sounds like we just woke you up. Yeah, you did. Well, listen, though, there's a reason we called you. We have a young man on our contest line who is playing the naked game. And he swears that if we ask you the question, who was the last person to see you naked, you'll say his name. Now, if you do, you'll both win a round trip flight to a very romantic tropical location of your choice. So the question is, Steph, who was the last person besides yourself to see you naked? Does she meet naked? Yes. Hey, baby. Baby.

I've been dating Yuki for six months. When she finally invited me to Sunday dinner with her family, my hands were sweating because this girl meant everything to me and family approval was her world. Just warning you, she said, gripping the steering wheel. They can be protective and they speak Japanese at home, so don't take it personally if they seem cold. I nodded, my stomach in knots. But she didn't know Japanese was my first language. Half Japanese through my mom, but I inherited every single one of my Irish dad's genes. Pale skin, light eyes, the works. People see me and assume white guy. And honestly, sometimes it's been easier to let them. Tanaka House hit me like a warm hug. Keco's cooking filled the air. Multiple generations chatted everywhere. Yuki's mom greeted me with a polite bow and formal smile. Nice to meet you, she said in careful English. The pleasure is mine. Tanakasan. That's when I caught it. The second I turned to her dad, I heard Keiko whisper to Yuki's aunt Kogai, when I got to, when I did, so you, this foreigner won't last long. Game on. For the next hour, I smiled politely while they served me passive aggression, English to my face, Japanese when they thought I couldn't understand and they were brutal me. Te Kogai, Yuki's grandmother said, passing rice. Look at this. Foreigner, so pale and weak looking. Karare washashitsukaina, her uncle muttered. He can't even hold chopsticks properly. No manners. Tommy enjoying the food, Yuki's cousin asked sweet, then whispered, he probably doesn't know what he's eating. I gritted my teeth but stayed quiet. Be polite. Don't cause a scene, Kiko said, refilling my tea. This person is so rude, doesn't even try to learn our customs, the aunt added. He's probably making fun of Japanese culture. Every comment was a small cut, but I kept my mouth shut. Yuki tried including me, switching languages, looking frustrated as conversations kept drifting to rapid Japanese that shut me out. Then her dad talked to Yuki's brother like I was invisible, he said, this is what happens when daughters go to universities. They bring home gaijin who will never understand us. Yuki WA hontoni bakada, the brother replied. Yuki is truly being stupid dating someone who doesn't speak our language. How can there be real love without communication? My jaw clenched. Canno jabun nojise WA munaishi iro keco added, she's wasting her life on someone who can't even talk to her family. My chest burned. I taken insults about my appearance, my manners, my culture. But calling Yuki stupid for loving someone, that crossed every line. Then.

No, she did not say that on the first day. Are you kidding me? You're lying. You're lying about that, Danny. That cannot be real. I swear to God. And she, what was that term again? What was that term again? Oh, man. She said I have to honk out a dirt snake. Was she being funny or was like, this is legit?

Like she had to have had a smile or been laughing. Yes, she had a smile and she patted her belly and she said, she said, it looks like someone dropped the kids off at the pool. She's so good. Oh my gosh. Was your face red? I didn't know what to say. And she just jumped right back into her meal. And after a few minutes, she noticed and she thought I didn't like it. She asked me if I didn't like the food. And I said, I just pretended I was feeling sick. I would, dude, I would have been so gross that like I'm with my girlfriend like a year and a half now and I don't even know that she does that still. And I don't ever plan on knowing that she does that. So. Alright, Danny, I can understand why that would be a turn off for you. Yeah, that's why I shook her hand. I just, I needed to get out of there. Alright, Danny, thank you very much for being honest. I'm sorry you had to endure that date. Yeah, thanks. I mean, I'm sorry too. Like That is that all you that you guys needed today or? Yeah, that's just about everything.

We were talking about future plans, her sister's wedding next summer, where I was supposed to be her plus one. Then on a random Thursday evening, she sat me down for the talk. I love you, but I'm not in love with you anymore. She. I think we should transition to being friends. We get along so well, have the same friend group. We'd make amazing friends. But not amazing partners. Here's what killed me. She said all this while already having packed a bag. Her friend Marissa was picking her up in an hour. She planned this whole thing down to having somewhere to stay, already got an exit strategy. I said, we're adults. We're friends. We can make this work. I sat there processing. Two years living together, talking about kids someday. Now she wants to be buddies? Okay. I said, yeah, let's be friends. She actually smiled, relieved, like I just agreed to her perfect plan where she gets to dump me but keep all the benefits of having me in her life. The next morning, I did exactly what Tara asked. Treated her like a friend. That's when I Learned she had a very different definition of friendship than I did. First text came at 7:00am. Could you drop Off my work laptop? Sure. I'll leave it at the front desk of your office Monday. Can't you bring it by Marissa's? I need it for the weekend. I've got plans. Monday works better. She didn't like that.

My dad showed up at my apartment with flowers for me like I was his girlfriend. And my fiance had to tell him he was my father, not my husband. I always knew my dad was weird about me. When my parents divorced when I was 9, my mom moved on pretty quick, found herself a nice guy named Paul who treated me like a normal stepdaughter. But my dad, he never dated anyone, ever. He'd always say I was his whole world and he didn't need anyone else. At first, it felt special. He'd pick me up from school with my favourite candy. He'd take me shopping and let me get whatever I wanted. He called our Saturday Hangouts daddy daughter dates, which seemed normal enough when I was 10. But things got weird as I got older. When I started wearing makeup in eighth grade, he threw it all away and said I was too beautiful to need that garbage. When I got my first phone, he demanded all my passwords because he needed to protect me from predators. He'd scroll through my texts every night at dinner. High school was worse. He hated all my friends, especially the guys. If I hung out with anyone he didn't approve of, he'd give me the silent treatment for days, just sit at dinner staring at his plate, acting like I didn't exist until I Apologized. The worst was when I told him I was dating Trevor when I was 17. We were driving to target and I casually mentioned I had a boyfriend. He pulled into the parking lot and just started crying, like ugly sobbing. He said I was throwing away everything we had together for some stupid boy who didn't really know me. I felt so guilty. I broke up with Trevor the next week. College gave me some space, but he'd call me three times a day. If I didn't answer, he'd drive the two hours to campus to make sure I was okay. My roommate thought it was sweet at first until she saw him show up at 1:00am because I'd fallen asleep without texting him good night. After graduation, I moved to my own apartment and met Malik at my job. He was calm.

Is Daisy Williams present in school today? My teacher, Missus Harrah, clicked the intercom button. Yes, the principal's voice echoed. Lockdown now. This is not a drill. The way he said it made my blood freeze. Missus Harrah shrieked under the desks. Lights off. Move, move, move. Nobody said anything, but everyone was thinking the same thing. There was a shooter. I couldn't help but think he was after me. A few minutes later, we heard sirens and then screaming. Missus Harrah tried to calm us down and told us it might be a misunderstanding, but her hands were shaking. She kept refreshing the email on her laptop like it was giving her live updates. The screaming got louder and it wasn't just one voice anymore. Multiple people in different parts of the building. Then we heard a loud pop from the hallway, like a metal slamming or something crashing hard. People started crying and whispering that the shooter was right outside and I believed them. Pia grabbed my hand and her palms were soaked with sweat. I could see Mister Kids class across the hall through our door window. Lights already off, no movement, just darkness where 20 kids should have been. I looked at our teacher and for the first time in my life, I saw her cry. She sat with us, hugged the younger kids and told us it would be okay. But after a while, She got up again and walked back to her laptop. Then we heard it, footsteps running past our door. Thud, thud, thud. I couldn't help myself. I had to look. Two paramedics were sprinting down the hall, pushing a wheeled stretcher, the kind you see on medical shows when someone's heart stops away from the door. Daisy, Missus Harrah whispered, voice shaking. She was scared, too. I sat down and immediately texted everyone what I had seen. Even Missus Harrah stood up slowly and crept to the door to check the window before opening it. That's when it flung open. The principal stood there with an actual cop who had his hand resting on his gun. You, Daisy, come with us. Immediately, my worst fear confirmed. The shooter had sent them or maybe they thought I was involved somehow. Missus Harra looked between them and me, confused. Get your things, honey, Missus Harra said. And that scared me more than anything because in three years of chemistry class, she'd never called me honey. Every single person was staring at me as I grabbed my backpack with shaking hands. The hallway was complete chaos. More cops than I'd ever seen in one place. I heard a paramedic shout, we're losing him. Move as he flew past us. My classmates were pressed against the door windows in every room watching me get us.

I pointed it out and he got so flustered, mumbling something about laundry. Then he looked at me totally serious and said, are you gonna cancel the date now? Like a nervous middle schooler, I fell for him right there, socks and all. Two, we were at the arcade and he got way too invested in the claw machine, not for himself, but because he saw a stuffed turtle. He said, look like me when I'm cranky. It took him six tries, 20 bucks and some serious trash talk to the machine, but he got it when he handed it to me. He said, now you can hold me when I'm not around. That turtle's still on my bed. 3, he doesn't know how to cook at all. But one night I was sick and he showed up with instant noodles, gummy bears and a handwritten get well card drawn in blue pen. He spelled fever wrong, but he also drew me as a superhero, complete with a cape and a little speech bubble that said, I got this. I swear I got better instantly. He made me a playlist titled Songs That Remind Me of You and forgot to check the shuffle setting. First song was Shrek 2 soundtrack. I asked if it was a joke. He panicked and said, no, it's romantic. He really loved her. Five, he tied my shoelace because it came undone and said, safety first, princess, like he was a knight or something. I giggled and he turned red. 6, I caught him flexing in the mirror when he thought I wasn't looking. He whispered, she likes strong arms to himself. I had to pretend I didn't hear so he wouldn't die of embarrassment. 7, we walked past a Lego store and he stopped mid sentence, gasped and said, can we please go in just for a minute? Thirty minutes later, he was building a tiny pirate ship and explaining the lore of each mini figure. Eight, he named a raccoon that lives near his apartment. Captain bites and leaves snacks for it. Every time it shows up, he waves like it's a neighbor. First time I saw it, he said, look, he came.

You mean the emergency backup onesie my baby wore after she had a poop explosion? Yes, it was pastel. It was against the rules. She is 7 months old. I'm pretty sure she doesn't know what dress code means. I specifically said dark colors for everyone. Are you suggesting my baby purposely sabotaged your wedding theme? I don't know, but the fact is she was wearing a light color during my moment. It was pink, not white, not sparkling, not covered in Swarovski crystals. Just pink. And she's shaped like a potato. A very noticeable potato. She can't walk, she can't talk, she can't even sit properly. She literally just drools and occasionally screams at ceiling fans. You could have brought a spare dress. I'm pregnant. I was too busy waddling, throwing up, and not passing out to double check a 7 month old's goth outfit rotation. Your husband could have done it. He packed the pink dress. He thought a baby wasn't part of the sacred white colour only threat protocol. Well, he was wrong. This was my day and that was her diaper explosion. We all suffered. You're missing the point. The photos. She was in the frame during my vows wearing pink. She was asleep. Her face was mashed into my chest. The only thing visible in the photo is the top of her fuzzy head and one baby sock. I saw the pink. Guests saw the pink. People will think I allowed pink. People will talk about what? The baby's fashion crimes. Breaking infant disrespectfully fails to read invite. Don't be sarcastic. This was the biggest day of my life, and my baby pooped in honor of it. Sincerely? Repeatedly. You should feel flattered. I just can't believe you'd let this happen. I feel so disrespected. She can't even hold a spoon. But okay, sure. She's a white dress wearing sabatour from the toddler underworld. I'm serious. I might crop her out of every picture. She would. Thank you. She didn't even want to be there. She's a baby. She wanted to eat her own foot and nap in peace. You owe me an apology. I'll send it in glittery pink from her.

The bell rang for 10 minutes before going silent. I broke through the dirt wall. Between us, a girl named Marisol fell into my tunnel, gasping and crying. She was only 15. Her parents buried her early because they'd caught her writing love letters. We spent 18 hours underground together. I shared my supplies, taught her the breathing exercises, kept her calm. When panic set in, we whispered about lives. We'd never get to live if we died down here. When they dug us up, they expected two broken girls. Instead, we crawled out, holding hands, filthy but furious. The crowd gasped. Two girls in one hole. Both alive, both unbroken. My mother's face went white when she saw Marisol. The elders immediately started shouting about tradition being violated, about how we cheated the ritual. My father grabbed my arm, hissing that I'd humiliated our bloodstream. But I wasn't done. In front of the entire village, I told them about the tunnel, about the girl whose bell they ignored. About the real tradition. Letting daughters die to create submissive wife. The elders called an emergency meeting. That night, my parents locked me in my room while they attended. Through my window, I could hear shouting from the community center. My mother came home sobbing, my father silent with. The next morning, they tried to bury me again. My father and three uncles dragged me from bed. My mother packed a second coffin with no water. This time, the Elders declared I needed a true burial, since I'd corrupted the first one. But Marisol had talked to her family, refused to participate. Three other families pulled their daughters from upcoming ceremonies. The photographer who'd been hired to document my burial for our family album caught everything. The forced second attempt, my screaming, my mother's dead eyes as she watched. He sent it to new stations that night. By the time they'd forced me into the second coffin, reporters were already driving to our village. They pulled me out after three hours when the first news van arrived. Tradition died in the flash of camera lights and the questions they couldn't answer about dead daughters. My family disowned me completely. They held a real funeral, buried an empty coffin with my name on it. They tell people I died in the first box. That what came out was a demon wearing my face. My mother burns sage when she sees me in the market. My father spits on the ground. But my sister Paloma won't be buried. Neither will Marisol's cousins or any other girl in our village.

You ever get betrayed so bad it doesn't just hurt, it rewrites you. That was me. My ex best friend Eli stabbed me in the back in a way I still don't fully understand. We've been close since we were kids, shared everything, laughed until our stomachs hurt. I thought we were brothers. Then senior year came around and I found out he'd been using me. Not in the he copied my homework way. No, this was deeper. He took everything I told him in confidence about my anxiety, my insecurities, my family stuff, my parents messy divorce and used it to build clout with a group of people I thought hated me. Turned my personal life into a punchline. I confronted him and he just smirked and said, grow a thicker skin, dude. It's just jokes. That night I decided to become someone else. It started off stupid. I wanted revenge. Nothing deep, just enough to embarrass him. I made a fake profile of a girl and named her J. It started off small, like turning my pictures into a female version, setting up a fake Instagram. My plan was simple, get him to say some pathetic flirty stuff and then leak it to the school. But Eli fell fast, faster than I expected. And the more he fell, the more I leaned in. What was at first meant to be a two Week job quickly turned full time. By week three, I was using a voice changer to call him. He'd call me every night before bed. Obviously I needed some compensation, so he'd cash app me 10 bucks every call. He'd say stuff like I've never felt this comfortable with anyone. He opened up in ways I'd never seen before. The way he talked to her, the way he needed her. And I started to realize something. He never respected me, but this version of me, this soft voiced, smiling, wide eyed girl from a few towns over, he worshipped her. What started as a joke stretched into weeks, then months. I'd spend hours each day crafting conversations, sinking voice filters, sending selfies, managing multiple burner accounts. I created playlists, family stories, fake college plans. I Learned everything about his insecurities, his fear of being alone, of not being good enough, of being forgotten. And I used all of it. A year in, I realized I'd gone too far. This wasn't revenge anymore. This was something else. I wasn't just catfishing him. I was breaking him and myself slowly and quietly. But the worst part was that I didn't stop. That's when the real revenge started. Jade became distant.

Oh, honey, let me tell you about the time my daughter didn't talk to me for two whole weeks because I betrayed her trust over a damn chicken nugget. So my daughter Lila, she's 14, has the attitude of a Beverly Hills housewife and the budget of a toddler. This girl acts like she's the CEO of the household. Tells me things like, mom, please don't embarrass me in front of my friends. Just stand still and blink like, ma'am, you live in my uterus rent free for nine months. Show some respect. Anyway, she decides she's going vegan. Great. I support her. I buy tofu, almond milk, overpriced plant nuggets that taste like regret. The whole shebang. Do I understand it? No, but I'm a supportive queen. But then one night, it's 1:00am, I'm watching reality TV in the dark, and I get hungry. I open the freezer and see those dino shaped chicken nuggets she begged for last year and never ate. So I pop, like, four in the air fryer. I'm minding my business, living my best life, and guess what? I forget to hide the evidence. Next morning, she walks into the kitchen, sniffs the air like a bloodhound, and goes, did you eat meat in this house? I said, uh, maybe. She gasps like, I just committed war crimes. You ate dead animals while I was sleeping? I said, baby girl, they were shaped like dinosaurs. They're barely meat. Calm down. She grabs her reusable water bottle, slams it on the counter, and yells, this is why the planet's dying, Because of people like you who can't control their midnight cravings! I said, okay, Greta Thunberg, relax. She storms off to her room and text me from down the hall, we're not speaking. This is a betrayal. I text back, fine, more dino nuggets for me. She leaves me on read y'all. Two weeks he wouldn't speak to me. Not even when I stubbed my toe and screamed so loud the neighbours checked on me. She just walked past me with her Hydro flask and judgmental aura. But then get this. One day I come home early from work, I walk into the kitchen, and there she is, standing in front of the microwave holding a plate with three dino nuggets. She's caught mid bite. We lock eyes. Time freezes. She goes, they don't count if they're Dinosaur shaped. I said, excuse me? She wipes her mouth like a criminal and goes, don't tell dad. I said, oh, I'm telling everyone. She bribes me with her leftover Starbucks gift card and begs for mercy. I post the photo in our family group chat anyway. Caption our little activist caught mid murder her grandpa.

It started about six months ago. Every argument, every little thing that didn't go her way, slam. Every time I asked her to do dishes, slam. When I told her she couldn't go to some party where I knew they'd be drinking, slam! The sound would shake the whole upstairs. My coffee mug fell off my nightstand twice from the vibrations. My husband Dave, kept telling me to ignore it. He'd say, kids go through phases. She'll grow out of it. Easy for him to say, since he's usually at work when most of the slamming happens. I'm the one working from home, trying to take client calls while slam! Echoes through the house. The breaking point came on a Tuesday. Emma wanted to borrow my car to drive to her friend Jesse's house. I said no because she got a speeding ticket the week before, and we agreed her driving privileges were suspended. She started screaming about how unfair I was, how I never trust her, how all her friends think I'm psycho. Then she stomped upstairs and slam! But this time was different. This time I heard something crack. Went up to check, and there was a split running down the door frame. The wood was actually damaged. That door had been slammed so hard and so many times that it was breaking the house. I stood there staring at that crack, and something just snapped. In me, I marched to the garage, grabbed Dave's screwdriver set, and went back upstairs. Emma was inside her room blasting music, probably expecting me to yell at her through the door like usual. Instead, I started unscrewing the hinges. It took me about 10 minutes. Emma didn't even notice until I was lifting the door off the frame. Then her music stopped real quick. Mom, what are you doing? She called out. Solving a problem, said carrying her door downstairs to the garage. She appeared at the top of the stairs in her pajamas, mouth hanging open. You can't take my door. I need privacy. You lost your privileges when you damaged the house, I told her. Privacy is earned, not guaranteed. The next few days were interesting. Emma tried everything. She hung a bed sheet across the doorway, which I took down. She moved her dresser to block the opening, so I moved it back. While she was at school, she even tried staying at her friend's house. Jess's mom called me asking what was going on. By day four, Emma was sitting on her bed when I got home from the grocery store. No music, no phone. Just sitting there. This is embarrassing. She. What if someone comes over? Then maybe you'll think twice before destroying property. I said I wasn't destroying anything. I was just mad. The door frame says otherwise. That's when she actually looked at the crack she'd made. I could see her face. Change. When she realised she'd actually damaged something. Day seven was when things got real. Emma's boyfriend Tyler came over to work on some school project. I watched from the kitchen as he walked upstairs, expecting to go into her room and

He used a VPN, but he forgot his Roblox was linked to an old Gmail. And that Gmail was tied to a Pinterest account which had his mom's full name, school photos, and boom. Home address. Kid's name Ethan Carter Suburban Software. Plays both Roblox and piano. But guess what Ethan? I play god. Step 2 enter the matrix. I spooked his school's IP, sent every computer in the lab a virus that played a deep fake video. Hi, I'm Ethan and I kiss my cat on the lips. He got detention, but I was just getting started. Step 3 Roblox wrecking ball. I made a new game just for him. Private server, custom map. Looked like his childhood bedroom, except the walls bled and every NPC whispered give it back Ethan! Even his Avatar looked like him, but melting. He joined, lasted 13 seconds before logging out. Blocked me, but I had already planted something special. Step 4 real life payload. I emailed his church. Yes, found it through his mom's Facebook with screenshots of his discord DMS.

I came home early and found my mom in bed with Mister. Lowell, my AP chemistry teacher who's married with three kids. I stood frozen in the doorway, feeling like I was about to vomit. Her blazer was draped over the lamp and his dress shirt lay inside out on the floor. The smell of his Cologne, the same one that made me gag in chemistry class, was now contaminating my mother's bedroom. Mr. Lowell ran past me, clutching his pants while his pale chest showed scratch marks, and my mother wrapped herself in a sheet with her face completely drained of color. Please let me explain, she said, with tears streaming down her face as she reached toward me with shaking hands. How could you? I screamed and backed into the hallway. He's my teacher. His wife goes to your book club. My mother sat on the bed and put her head in her hands while her whole body trembled. I had no choice. Everyone has a choice about who they sleep with, I said as my voice cracked. Mom said, Mr. Lowell has been selling pills to students at your school. My face dropped. What? Fentanyl, sweetheart? Xanax? Adderall. Three kids have overdosed this semester alone. I stared at her and tried to process this. So you decided to have an affair with him? How does that make any sense? Even If he was, why wouldn't you just call the police? My mother stood on unsteady legs and walked to her closet. She pulled out a box from the top shelf with trembling hands. Inside were photos, recording devices, and documents with FBI letterhead. My blood went cold when I looked at surveillance photos of my chemistry teacher in dark parking lots. Mister Lowell isn't just some teacher selling pills on the side, she said while her voice broke. He's part of a major operation. They're using teachers in five districts because no one suspects educators. She sat back down and looked older than I'd ever seen her. The FBI recruited me six months ago because I had access to him through school events. Just supposed to gather information at PTA meetings. But he wouldn't talk business unless we got closer. Tears were running down her face now. One of the kids who overdosed died last month. You remember? He was 14 years old. His little sister found his body. I remembered his memorial, where his parents sobbed uncontrollably. His little sister had to be carried out of the auditorium while the rest of us wore purple ribbons. Does dad know? I whispered. No one knows except my handler. She looked destroyed. Not even your father knows. Because if anyone knew, the whole operation would collapse. We spread photos across the bed showing Mister Local meeting teachers in parking garages. Text messages using code words were visible alongside a spreadsheet of Student names with prices that made me sick. These were kids I knew and sat next to in class. They target specific students, he said while showing me their notes. Kids with divorced parents, kids with anxiety about college, and foster kids are all marked. They know exactly who's vulnerable. She pulled out another document while her hands shook. Worse now they're expanding to middle schools and planning to recruit eighth graders as dealers. Brother's friend Bram is on their list. I felt my stomach drop thinking about Bram, who played video games at our house every weekend. He still wore superhero shirts and collected Pokemon cards. Look at his file, she said. Single mom who works nights and they're behind on rent. They know exactly what to offer him. They've been watching him for months and documenting his routine. She showed me more files detailing five kids who died from overdoses in two years, with all deaths made to look accidental or like suicides. Teachers were discussing doses in group texts like they were talking about homework assignments. Mr. Lowell handles the AP students personally, she said. He offers them study aids for the SAT s, then gradually increases the doses.

If you hurt that kid, the deal is off and I'm calling the whole thing right now. Whatever she heard next and all the confidence from her voice and she answered, fine, but you get 15 minutes max and then we're gone before the parents suspect anything. She walked back toward the stairs and I realized with this cold, crushing feeling that she wasn't just robbing us, but that someone else was coming and that person wanted to do something to me. And the only reason they hadn't already was because she was apparently the reasonable one in whatever sick plan this was. I waited until I heard her go back downstairs, then crawled to my room on my hands and knees to get my phone from under my pillow where I always hit it during dinner.

I was halfway through our Valentine's sleepover at Sophie's, laughing at Maya's impression of her hinge date when my phone lit up. It was my best friend Chloe. So I saw you posted that you're wearing the blue dress to my birthday brunch tomorrow. Yeah, we need to talk about that. The room got quiet. Sophie stopped mid stroke on Jess's pinky nail. Okay, I'm not trying to be a bitch, but when you wear it, you look like a stuffed sausage. It's really embarrassing. She pause to examine her lashes. Remember Brad's pool party when you wore that bikini, and I told you everyone was judging you? This is gonna be worse. I'm just being honest because I love you. Click. He hung up before I could even process. Everyone was staring at me. 20 seconds of pure silence while my face filled with heat and I tried not to cry. Guys, she didn't mean it like that. She's just an honest person. Oh, hell nah. Maya actually threw her nail polish bottle onto the couch. Did that hoe just call you a stuffed sausage? The girl from Sophie's work who I just met tonight said, girl, what the actual fuck? Maya was already scrolling through Chloe's Instagram. This bitch. Maya held up her phone. She literally posted about body positivity yesterday. Wait, wait, wait. Sophie said, isn't her birthday brunch at that bougie place downtown? The one where all the influencers go? I Nodded, still trying to stop crying. Jess, who never swears, said, fuck this. Girl. Girls, new plan. The energy shift was instant. Suddenly everyone was huddled around me like we were planning a heist. Sophie pulled up the revolve website. What dress is it? I showed them the blue midi with the cut out back. Okay, it's in stock, so he said, adding it to her cart. What size? Within five minutes, every single girl had ordered the same dress in their size. Overnight shipping. Still, I defended her, blissfully unaware of what a good friend is meant to look like. But guys, this isn't necessary. It's just the way she is. Girl, I love you, but you need to shut the fuck up, because this is happening, Maya said, still furiously scrolling through Chloe's socials. Oh, this is gold. She told everyone she's 24 tomorrow. This bitch is turning 27. How do you know? I asked, pretending to be surprised because I found her college graduation photos from 2020. Do the math. By 3:00am, they'd found her real age, her actual job, MLM, her face tune fails, and the fact that she'd been telling people she got into Cornell when she went to community college. Nothing wrong with that. But lying? Guys, is this too mean? I don't want her to be sad on her birthday. Girl, we're giving her exactly what she wants, Maya said with a smirk. She wants all the attention in her dress. she'll Be the only one not in blue and get all the attention she wants. Even I couldn't argue with that. Like, she kinda ate. The next morning, my friends wouldn't let me check my phone. They did my makeup, hyped me up, and we all got dressed together. Six girls in almost identical maxi dresses. Girl, the body is bodying! Sophie exclaimed. Eight down! Maya yelled, cheekily, slapping my ass. It was the first time girls had hyped me up like that, and I couldn't even hide my smile. We rolled up to the restaurant together. I could see Chloe through the window at a long table, wearing black, surrounded by her sorority sisters. She saw us approaching and her face went through like five different expressions. Happy birthday, babe! Maya said way too loudly as we walked in. Happy 27th! The table went silent. One of

My mom is the academic baddie of the family. She has three degrees and one PhD, all from Ivy Leagues. And whenever I won an academic award, she'd brag about it for weeks, say it was all because of her. That was her thing. It was like she still wanted to hang on to her glory days. Well, I wasn't going to be the one to ruin that. So when she wanted all of my college application essays to go through her first, I let her. After all, she was the one to get my GPA up to 4.2. But then something strange happened. No college was accepting me, and I never received a single rejection email either. Instead, I got angry, sometimes even threatening ones like Harvard, who said my essay was a disgrace, or brown, who threatened to have me blacklisted from other schools. It was around this time that I started to notice a pattern. Every time I got rejected, she got this look in her eyes like she'd known all along, like she wanted it that way. But there was only one college I actually wanted to go to, university of North Carolina at Charlotte. I never told my mom about it because it wasn't an Ivy League. Plus, I didn't want her to think I was a failure for not getting accepted into yet another college. But then something strange happened. I got an interview within just two weeks. Of applying. They told me I was exactly the kind of student they were looking for. And that evening, I couldn't help myself. I did the craziest thing known to mankind. I told my mother. And despite everything, I still expected her to jump up with excitement or at least smile. But no. Instead, she just said, that's wonderful, sweetie, but don't get too excited. You don't want to be disappointed. I stared at her blankly. It was the first time I asked myself whether my mom really wanted the best for me. And I reminded myself about all the hours she had put into making me study, how my GPA was only high because of her. So I told myself the same thing she's always said to me, that I was being ungrateful. But after a week, I finally snapped because my dream college told me I was the perfect candidate. But week later, I got the email from U N. C. Charlotte. There it was in plain red, Ariel font, rejected. It was the nastiest email I had ever seen. Didn't even mention my grades, just talked about my poor character. But I wasn't confused. I knew that somehow my mom was behind it. So I stopped telling her anything, found a tiny school 3 states away that she never heard of, applied in secret, got in, packed my car the day after graduation and left while she was at her stupid book club for the first few Weeks, she called me every day but I never picked up because every time she would leave me a cute little voice recording, it was 5 minutes long where she described how much of an embarrassment I was to the family name. Another said I was sabotaging everything she had worked for and my favorite, that I was going to end up in a dead end job at 30 and end up dying alone. Like, mom, isn't that you? Lol. Anyway, I blocked her after that and most of my family took my side. Fast forward 5 years and I'm now a paralegal with an amazing salary and perspective job. I was in the middle of joking to my coworker about how we both thought we never get into college when she asked what my GPA was, 4.2 dash. What? What? She exclaimed. How the EF did you struggle to get in? Before I could even respond, she picked up her phone and called her dad. My dad's a college admission officer. Sorry, but I need to know what happened. I just smiled. Daisy had always been a little quirky. Daddy, do you know his effery encounter my name? By this point, I was almost killed over from how hard I was laughing, swatting the phone to try and get her to give up. But as soon as he responded, my body went still from 2,019 to Harvard. Daisy was smiling, I wasn't. Yes, daddy, I knew your memory was Still good. Why didn't she get.

One day my daughter came back from school and ran into my arms like she was scared. I could feel her shaking so I took her inside and made some French toast, which was her favorite food. I thought she just had a really bad day and missed being at home. But I couldn't have been more wrong. Once she calmed down, she told me, Mommy, something happened today and I think I'm supposed to tell you about it. An uneasy knot formed itself in my heart when she told me that the school counselor had called her into his office for a special game. He handed my daughter a stuffed unicorn and told her that this new game was very popular with the children, which made my daughter excited and eager to learn. Then the counselor made her point the unicorn between his legs and push on it repeatedly. My daughter told me how he made weird faces at times and then closed his eyes and leaned back. Towards the end, I was so horrified and felt a wave of nausea rush through my body so I had to go to the bathroom and throw up. What kind of sick person would make a 7 year old girl do this kind of thing? Not to mention he worked at a school and it was me who willfully sent my daughter near his vicinity. I kept Bouncing between blaming myself and wanting to burn the entire world. My husband was no longer with us, so it was up to me to stand up for my daughter. I don't know what made me approach the school administration before the police, but that's exactly what I did. And the school administration laughed at me, saying that my daughter was clearly playing a prank. They said they had heard other students make similar jokes about the school counselor and said that parents should teach their kids not to lie. By the time I made it to the police station, the school had already called them and explained the situation. They thought I was a crazy mother who was trying to give merit to my daughter's filthy lie. I had looked straight into my daughter's eyes when she told me the story, so I knew she was telling the truth. But no one wanted to believe me. And I felt like I was in a nightmare. This is when I remembered something important and ran back home to open my jewelry safe. Inside there was a note that I hadn't looked at for a long time. You see, although I was currently a doctor, I had been a very inexperienced nurse at one point. And one time a very stern looking man with a lot of face tattoos walked into our hospital with a bullet wound. No other nurse wanted to treat him since he looks so scary. So they Sent me. I convinced myself that everyone deserves treatment and cleaned his wounds with the utmost concentration. I even engaged him in conversation and joked about how he should stay away from bullets in the future. When it was all over, the guy thanked me and handed me a note with his phone number on it. He said, if you ever need someone taken care of, I won't ask for any payment. I typed in that phone number and to my surprise, it actually connected. I told him who I was and he said, I remember you.

How did you do it? My ex, Ashley, thought our relationship was charity work. Every time we went somewhere together, she'd find ways to remind me I'd never find someone like her again. It started with her introducing me as just a friend at bars. When guys hit on her, she'd let them buy her drinks. Then mentioned she had a boyfriend after. You should see their faces when I point to you. She'd laugh later. The shock is hilarious. The worst was when she just disappeared one Saturday. No text, nothing. Then I saw her Instagram story. Ashley on some yacht wearing basically a string bikini, sitting on some guy's lap while he popped champagne. Videos of her dancing with a bunch of rich dudes, them doing body shots off her stomach. Best day ever. With location tag, Miami Beach. We live in Jersey. When she came back Sunday night, sunburnt and hungover, I was furious. Where the f were you? She rolled her eyes. Tom invited me to his yacht party last minute. It was a networking opportunity. Tom was some crypto guy who'd been dming her for months. You went to Miami without telling me? She laughed, actually laughed. It was last minute, babe. These chances don't come often. When I showed her the videos of her grinding on those guys, she shrugged. It's a boat thing. Everyone was dancing. Don't be so uptight. You're in a relationship, I yelled. Yeah. And I came back, didn't I? She ruffled my hair like I was a child. I could have stayed in Miami. Tom has this insane condo. He wanted to fly me to Ibiza next week. She pinched my cheek. But I came back to Jersey to my little computer nerd, my anxious overthinker who's mad about a boat party. She kicked off her heels and collapsed on my bed. I looked past all these red flags with rose colored glasses until the one year anniversary incident happened. I planned everything perfectly just for her on our anniversary. Flowers in hand, campaign in my car, reservation at her favorite restaurant. I was about to knock on her apartment door to surprise her when I heard voices through her open window. Ashley and her friends, all Instagram model types who made fun of me whenever they visited. Ash, I still don't get it. Her friend Jenna was saying, why are you with him? You could have literally anyone. I kept closer to the window, still holding the roses like an idiot. Ashley laughed. You want to know a secret? He'll never leave me, ever. I could do anything and he'd take it. I have complete freedom. I go to Miami. He waits. I hang with my exes. He deals with it. Tom keeps flying me places. Brad takes me to dinner. But this one, she laughed again. He worships me, like actually worships me. But don't you want someone better? Another voice. Asked eventually, yeah. But you know how Brad destroyed my confidence when he cheated with that bartender? This one looks at me like I'm God. He tells me I'm perfect every morning, begs me not to leave him. I need that right now. I heard them all giggling. Once I feel like myself again, I'll find someone on my level. But for now, he's exactly what my ego needs, like therapy but free. They all burst out laughing. I stood there, flowers in hand, and knew something had to change. She needed me for her ego. Time to take away her supply. I spent the next two weeks planning exactly how to.

For as long as I can remember, my sister Claire has tried to compete with me. She's two years older, but whenever I achieved something, she found a way to one up me. When I got engaged, she got engaged six months later. When I bought my first house, she bought one down the street. But nothing compared to what she did when I got pregnant. My husband and I struggled for years with infertility. After two heartbreaking miscarriages and countless doctor visits, we finally got the news that we were expecting. It felt like a miracle. From the moment I saw those two pink lines, I already knew the name I wanted for my daughter. My grandmother raised me. After my dad passed and my mom checked out, she was my entire world. Her name was Evangeline. And before she passed, she used to say, if you ever have a little girl, I hope she carries my name. I told Claire the name one night when I was three months pregnant. I thought we were having a sister moment. She smiled and said it was beautiful. I should have known better. Two months later, Claire announced she was pregnant, too. She acted surprised and thrilled that our babies would grow up together. I was genuinely happy for her. Until the family baby shower she threw for herself. As I walked into the decorated venue, I saw a giant sign that nearly knocked the breath out of me. Welcome baby of Evangeline. I froze. I thought it had to be a coincidence, but now Claire got up and made a speech about how she always loved our grandmother's name and how it was perfect for her daughter. I pulled her aside after the speeches, trying to keep my voice steady. Claire, you knew I was naming my daughter of Evangeline? She smirked and shrugged. Well, I'm due first. Nothing stopping you from picking something else. I was stunned. My entire family just stood there awkwardly pretending not to take sides. My mom even whispered, it's just a name, honey. But it wasn't. It was the one promise I made to my grandmother. I went home that night and cried harder than I ever had through our infertility journey. But the longer I sat there, the more my sadness hardened into something else. Termination. If Claire wanted to play dirty, fine, but she underestimated me. I spent the next few weeks quietly gathering every piece of paperwork I needed. See, Claire hadn't actually filed any legal paperwork yet. She was calling the baby Evangeline, but hadn't registered the name officially. Meanwhile, I expedited my own legal name reservation with the state. In our state, you can pre

Apparently they've tried to call you a bunch and you're not responding to them. So they asked if maybe we could get you on the phone. Oh, okay. I'm sorry. I'm a little confused.

Yeah. Okay. So what happened? Oh, God, this is so embarrassing. Is it like what, what did Ed tell you about our, about our date?

My son came into my room fully dressed for school and just stood there in the doorway like he was waiting to be punished. I asked what was wrong and he said, can I stay home today? I feel really sad. I don't know why. I just don't wanna go. At first I almost gave him the response I was raised on. Life doesn't stop just because you're in a mood. But the way he said it, it didn't sound like a kid trying to skip class. It sounded like a kid trying not to cry from something much worse. I told him to go sit down while I got ready, then walked into the bathroom and locked the door. I needed a second to breathe because something about it hit too hard. Not the sadness, the fact that he asked. As a kid, I was taught to hide feelings like that, to bury them deep, never speak them out loud, and especially never expect kindness afterward. So I took a breath, came out and told him, alright, you're staying home, but you're not in trouble. And I'm not mad. He kept looking at me like he was waiting for the butt. There wasn't one. We spent the day doing nothing worth posting about. We didn't talk about why he felt sad. I didn't try to fix it. I just let him exist. We made lunch, watched something stupid, and sat on the couch. Like the world wasn't pressing down on either of us. At one point, he looked over and asked, do you ever feel sad for no reason? I nodded more times than I can count. He didn't say anything else, just leaned against me and closed his eyes. That night, while he brushed his teeth, he looked at me in the mirror and said, I thought you'd be mad. Last time I cried, you told me to act my age. I. I didn't even remember saying that, but apparently he did. After he went to bed, I stayed up cleaning the living room. I found his backpack under the blanket he had curled up in, and when I unzipped it to pull out his lunch box, I saw a folded sheet of paper tucked between two math work sheets. It wasn't a school assignment. It was a note written in pencil, erased and rewritten more than once. It said, I don't want to feel this way anymore, but if I tell someone, they'll make me feel worse for not wanting to be alive.

I hated group projects more than anything in college. Every single time I'd end up doing all the work while everyone else just showed up for the grade. So when Professor Williams assigned our final ethics project worth 30% of our grade, I swore things would be different this time. The professor randomly put me with three students I barely knew, Alex, Jordan and Sam. I was actually excited because maybe working with strangers would mean they'd actually care about their grades. Boy, was I wrong. I made a group chat the same day and sent detailed messages about meeting times, dividing up the work and setting deadlines. Radio silence. I tried again the next day. Nothing. I even walked up to Alex after class and asked if he got my messages. He just shrugged and said, yeah, we'll figure it out later. Two weeks passed. The 20 page research paper was due in 10 days and nobody had written a single word. I kept sending messages, trying to set up meetings, offering to do video calls. They left me on read every single time. I had a choice. I could let our whole group fail or I could do what I always did. So I spent the next week pulling all nighters, researching corporate ethics scandals, writing analysis after analysis, adding proper citations and references, 23 pages of solid work. I was exhausted but proud when I Submitted it online. I only put my name on it, not theirs, just mine. The very next morning, the day before our presentation, my phone started buzzing like crazy. Alex was calling me over and over. When I finally picked up, he sounded panicked. Hey, Maya, we're all ready to present now. Just make sure you add our names back to the title slide before class. Okay? I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Add your names back. You guys didn't help write anything. Come on, don't be like that. We're a team. Just put us on there. I hung up. 20 minutes later, Sam was knocking on my dorm room door, acting all friendly like we were best friends. Maya, hey, we just wanna make sure everything's good for tomorrow. We can all present different sections. What sections did you write? I asked. Well, we didn't technically write them, but we can present them. That's basically the same thing, right? I told her no and closed the door. That's when things got ugly. They emailed Professor Williams that same night, claiming I had excluded them maliciously from the project and refused to collaborate. They said I was trying to take all the credit for work they had done. They even said I deleted their contributions from the shared document. Professor Williams replied to all of us the next morning. He said there would be a hearing after class where each person would be graded individually based on what they Could prove they contributed. When I walked into the classroom for our presentation, my three group members were already there with printed papers and fake concerned expressions. They had actually printed out what looks like rough drafts with their names on them. During the hearing, they went first. Alex claimed he had written the entire introduction and that I had deleted it and rewritten it in my own words. Jordan said he had researched all the case studies, but I had stolen his work. Sam said she had done the conclusion, but I had cut her out completely. They showed Professor Williams.

She returned 6 years later to find I divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years Max. Don't change the locks. He left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation to our 8 year olds. That first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decisions. No more walking on eggshells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curve ball in our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year 2 brought unexpected changes without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I'd been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd forgotten how To enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually, she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her Bonus Mom, their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes and tucked them in at night. Year 5 was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and, and being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year 6, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor role. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family.

So my brother Jake got married, like, three weeks ago, and the whole thing was basically a slap in the face. His wife Megan, decided nobody under 21 could come because they were serving alcohol and didn't want any minors getting drunk. I was 19 at the time, which apparently made me some kind of liability. The excuse was complete bullshit, and everyone knew it. I don't even drink that much. Maybe a beer here and there with friends, but I'm not some alcoholic teenager who's gonna embarrass their precious wedding. But whatever. That's what they decided, and my parents just went along with it, like always. I asked them to reconsider a few times because, honestly, it hurt. Jake and I used to be close growing up. We shared a room until I was 14, played video games together, the whole thing. But ever since he started dating Megan two years ago, she's basically been calling all the shots. She thinks she's better than everyone because her dad owns some car dealership and she went to private school. After they kept saying no, I just stopped caring. If I wasn't good enough for their wedding, then fine. I wasn't gonna beg anymore. Then last Saturday rolls around, and Jake texts our family group chat saying he wants everyone to go to some fancy steakhouse to celebrate the wedding. My parents Were all excited, talking about how nice it would be to finally celebrate as a family, but I just replied that I wasn't going. My mom called me right away asking why not? I told her the same thing I told everyone else. I didn't see the point in celebrating something I wasn't even invited to. She tried to guilt trip me, saying it would mean a lot to Jake and that my cousins Becca and Tyler were going even though they didn't get invited either. But here's the thing. Becca is 13 and Tyler is 15. Their parents literally forced them to go. They didn't have a choice. I'm 19, I pay my own phone Bill, I work at Best Buy part time, and I'm starting community college in the fall. I can make my own decisions about where I spend my Saturday night. My parents kept trying to convince me all week. My dad even offered to pay for my meal, which honestly just made it worse. Like, you couldn't fight for me to be at the actual wedding, but now you wanna throw money at me to show up to the Celebration dinner? The night of the dinner, I. I stayed home and ordered pizza. I was playing call of duty with my friends when my phone started blowing up. First it was Jake texting me asking where I was. Then Megan sent me this long paragraph about how disappointed she was that I couldn't be mature enough. To support my brother's happiness. Funniest part is they acted all surprised that I didn't show up. I literally told them I wasn't going. What did they expect? After they got home from dinner, Jake came to my room and tried to have some.

She returned 6 years later to find I divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years Max. Don't change the locks. He left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation to our 8 year olds. That first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decisions. No more walking on eggshells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curve ball in our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year 2 brought unexpected changes without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I'd been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd forgotten how To enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually, she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her Bonus Mom, their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes and tucked them in at night. Year 5 was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and, and being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year 6, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor role. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward after Three years of zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from the living room.

When I tell people my 12 year old daughter only speaks to five people in the entire world, they think I'm exaggerating. I'm not. After what her father did to her? Years of abuse that started when she was barely old enough to form memories, trust became a foreign concept. She talks to me, her aunt, her grandparents, and her best friend. That's it. Touch her unexpectedly and she might have a panic attack. Ask her a direct question if you're not on that list, and she'll stare at the floor until you give up. Her Nintendo Switch is her lifeline. It's the only place where she feels completely safe, where she has control and where no one can hurt her. She takes it everywhere, clutching it like armor against a world that's already proven it can be cruel. I used to worry about the addiction until her therapist explained it. It's her safe space. Let her have it. I met Lucas eight months ago. I didn't tell him about Maddie for the first three months, not because I was hiding her, but because I needed to be sure. She'd only met two of my dates in the eight years since her father left, and both times ended in disasters that set her progress back months. The first one tried to high five her. She didn't speak for three days. The second brought her A teddy bear, and tried to hug her. The panic attack lasted an hour. Lucas was different from the start. When I finally told him about Maddie, about the abuse, about the silence, about the switch that never left her hands, he didn't do what the others did. He didn't say, I'm great with kids or she'll warm up to me. He just said, I'll just follow your lead. We waited another two months before they met. I planned it carefully. A brief encounter at our apartment. No pressure, no expectations. Maddie knew he was coming. She sat on the couch with her switch headphones on, already retreating into her digital world. Lucas walked in, gave her a small wave. She didn't return, and then did something unexpected. He pulled out his own switch and sat in the chair across the room, not next to her, not trying to see her screen, just playing his own game. Twenty minutes passed in silence. Then Maddie's head tilted slightly. I saw her glancing at his screen. Another 10 minutes go by and she pause her game. I held my breath. Is that Mario Kart? Her voice was so quiet I almost missed it. Lucas looked up. Casual as anything. Yeah, the new one. Do you play? She nodded. I'm terrible at Rainbow Road, he said, then went back to playing. Five minutes later, I can beat Rainbow Road. No way. It's impossible. And just like that, my silent daughter was offended enough. To speak again. It's not impossible. I have three stars on every cup. Lucas paused his game, looking genuinely impressed. Every cup? Even 2 hundred C C? She actually sat up straighter. Especially 2 hundred C C. Prove it. I watched, stunned as Maddie scooted to the edge of the couch, not closer to him. She maintained that careful distance, but engaged. We could race online. They exchanged friend codes without ever leaving their separate spaces. For the next hour, they played Mario Kart together while sitting eight feet apart. Maddie didn't just play, she trash talked. You're about to eat my dust, she muttered after selecting her character when she won the first race. She actually smiled when Lucas Blue shelled her on the third lap of

I painted it. I was standing in front of my largest piece at the gallery opening, champagne in hand, when a man in an expensive suit approached and started explaining my own painting to me. He had no idea I was the artist because the placard said Riley Turner, who he clearly assumed was a man since he kept talking about his brilliant technique. This guy Robert looked me up and down and said, you seem young to be at an opening like this. Let me guess, looking for a rich boyfriend? Smart girl. Lots of wealthy men here. He gestured at my painting like he owned it. See, what Riley is doing here requires years of training to appreciate. You probably just think the colours are pretty. The average woman just sees decoration. I took a sip of champagne and said, interesting perspective, which I guess he took as encouragement. Robert moved closer to the painting, physically stepping in front of me, and continued his lecture. A girl like you probably thinks this is just nice to look at, but there's actual intelligence behind it. The artist is obviously a man, because women simply don't have this kind of technical mastery. Female painters do. Flowers and feelings. This has real intellectual depth. It's biological, really. Men are just more capable of this level of abstraction. When I mentioned I was familiar with the Artist's work. Robert laughed and patted my shoulder. Following him on Instagram to look at the Pretty Pictures doesn't count as being familiar with Art, Sweetheart. You probably think you're cultured because you went to that Van Gogh light show. Real knowledge comes from decades of study, not whatever you Learned from TikTok. Robert decided to test me. Rapid firing questions. Who's Basquiat? What's Kiara Scuro? Name three Renaissance painters besides da Vinci. When I started to answer, he cut me off. Wrong. See, this is why galleries shouldn't have open events. You probably googled some terms before coming here to impress men, but Riley here is working in a tradition you couldn't possibly understand without a proper education. Not community college, sweetie. Real universities. He returned to my painting, now explaining it louder to raw crowd. What Riley has achieved here would cost probably 100,000 in education to even attempt. The materials alone cost more than you'd make in a month at whatever retail job you have. He looked at my outfit with disgust. Target clearance rack, right? Someone who shops there couldn't possibly grasp the investment in this piece. He probably spent more on one brush than your entire outfit. When I suggested the artist might be self taught, Robert sneered at me. Is that how you Learned about art? Painting parties? Robert grabbed my wrist to me to another angle, his grip too tight. You're too stupid to even stand in the right spot. Riley intended for This. To be viewed from exactly here, your ignorance is actually disrespectful to his work. He kept his hand on my wrist while explaining though. Honestly, explaining this to you is like teaching calculus to a toddler. You lack the basic foundation to understand any of it. He noticed me trying to pull away and squeeze harder. What am I keeping you from taking selfies? This is exactly why serious collectors hate these events. Girls like you come for the free alcohol and to hunt for sugar daddies. You're polluting the space where real art appreciation happens. He waved at a security guard. She's drunk. And her

Said I'd end up cleaning toilets for people like him, not knowing his dad worked for my mom. I was the quiet kid in eighth grade whose mom always said to keep a low profile at school. She dropped me off a block away every morning before heading to her office, and I knew not to mention that she meant the executive suite of the biggest company in town. Bruce's dad worked there, too, always bragging about being a regional sales manager. Bruce had no idea my mom was the one who signed his dad's paychecks, though. And because of that, Bruce made me the target of his bullying. Everything started on a Tuesday morning in early October when Bruce knocked my books out of my hands in the main hallway while I knelt down to gather my scattered papers. He stood there laughing with his friends. Later that same day, when I held the door open for him after lunch, he shoved past and told everyone I was probably hoping for a tip like a doorman. By Thursday of that week, he had progressed to stealing my lunch money during second period and announcing loudly that I was too poor to afford food anyway. Friday afternoon brought another escalation when he shoved me into a locker after PE and made comments about my clothes smelling like thrift store while the entire hallway erupted in laughter. The following week brought even worse treatment. Every time I raised my Hand. During English class on Monday, he interrupted to call me stupid and wrong. When test results came back on Wednesday and I had earned an A, he grabbed my paper right off my desk and ripped it into pieces while telling everyone the teacher probably felt too sorry for me to give me the F I really deserved. During lunch periods throughout that week, his harassment evolved from simply knocking over my tray to something more humiliating. Would grab my sandwich from my reused grocery bag, take a dramatic bite, and spit it out while declaring it was welfare food and mystery meat before throwing everything in the trash. On a particularly bad Thursday, I tried a different approach and offered him my chips, thinking maybe kindness would work. He knocked them out of my hand and ground them into the cafeteria floor with his heel while explaining that he didn't want to catch whatever diseases poor people carry. The entire cafeteria watched in silence. He made me clean up the mess with my bare hands. Physical education class became my daily nightmare after that. He would wait until I was changing clothes, then grab everything I owned and throw it all in the shower, leaving me standing there in my underwear. While I tried to retrieve my soaked clothes, he would loudly describe to the entire locker room how skinny and malnourished I looked from eating dollar store food. The harassment reached new levels the day he found My phone with its cracked screen. In early November, he picked it up and called it ancient junk, then explained that his dad had told him poor people always have broken phones because they can't take care of anything. He threw it on the ground and stomped on it repeatedly until the screen went completely black and the phone wouldn't turn on anymore. When I wore the same jacket three days in a row because my other one was still drying from being thrown in the shower, he started a rumor that I only owned one set of clothes. He would make gagging sounds whenever I walked past in the hallways and hold his nose while telling everyone I hadn't changed my underwear in a week. Career day arrived in mid November, and Bruce had spent the entire week telling everyone how his dad was going to present about being successful in business. The morning of the presentations, he cornered me in the bathroom and pushed my head toward the toilet while his friends held the door shut. He kept my face inches from the water and told me I better get used to cleaning toilets for rich people like him. His dad went first during the presentations, strutting around the classroom.

Ever since I was born, our house had an open door policy. If that open door policy took steroids, my dad specifically loved enforcing it and always told us that if a door was left closed, I could say goodbye to it. I always thought he was joking until I turned 5 and experienced it myself. I was in the room with my dolls with a closed door, when suddenly it slammed open. Next thing I knew, dad had his tools out and was taking the door clean off its hinges. He then went out into the back and burned it. It still had my bunny stickers on it, but he didn't care how hard I cried. On top of that, by dinner, not only the door, but the dolls I bought with my own money were burned, too. I cried to my mom, but all she could say was that dad had anxiety about hidden dangers, so it was best to just let him feel safe. Thing is, this only got worse as I got older. When I got my first period, I desperately wanted some privacy, but the curtain my dad installed wouldn't fully close. Naturally, I shut the door. That's when he barged in, claiming nothing natural needs hiding. He stood there while I changed my tampon in the shower, telling me not to be shy. I thought it couldn't get much Worse. But I was wrong. After weeks of begging my mom for a sleepover, she finally agreed for my 14th birthday. My friends arrived excited, having never visited until they saw our doorless house. There were a few strange glances thrown my way, but we moved on, running straight to my room, giggling with excitement. But the happiness did not last long. My dad started hourly safety patrols with his flashlight, peering into my room. He came in and examined every one of my friends, telling them to twirl to make sure they didn't have anything on him. And since I was the only one with the skirt, I had to twirl the longest. My friends were too creeped out and got their parents to pick them up the next day in school. Everyone was whispering about my doorless house and creepy dad. Their parents banned them from talking to me. I lost all my friends and became completely isolated. I remember at this time I began truly hating my dad, and that only intensified at 16. I woke up to him pulling off my blanket. I screamed at him and he went red before claiming he was searching under my mattress for contraband. My mom actually tried to intervene, but she was dragged out of my room. All I heard was the slap before the house went silent. The next morning, my mom had a bruise, and my door frame had a camera set up in it. I left At 17, with just a backpack to go to college, I didn't speak to either of them for a full 20 years. And I should have left it like that. But one day I decided to bring my 12 year old daughter to visit. I didn't want to see dad, only mom. So I had her promise me that she'd keep my dad away from my daughter. She said yes. Well, at around 2:00am, I woke to the feeling of my daughter pressing into my chest. She was sobbing that Grandpa had been touching her hair. And that's when I saw the blanket we had put up for some privacy have been torn down. Dad had been touching my daughter the whole time we slept. I rushed out and saw him in his room sleeping, pressing the blanket against his chest. I wanted to call him on the spot, but before I had the chance to confront him, my mom appeared out of the bathroom. I could see visible signs of what must have been her attempting to stop him. She broke down and started whisper apologize

I stared at that crumpled 20 and two tens like they were aliens. My daughter Emma was only 7, and I had no clue whose kid I was supposedly feeding. The handwriting was neat, definitely an adult's. And the note was on some fancy stationery with little flowers on it. When Emma got home from school, I showed her the money and asked what was going on. She just shrugged and said, oh, that's from Becca's mom. Becca doesn't have lunch money this week, so I've been sharing my sandwich. My heart melted a little, but I was also confused. Why didn't this mom just pack her own kid lunch? The next morning, I decided to pack extra food just in case. Two sandwiches, two juice boxes, extra crackers. Emma didn't even question it. She just smiled and said, thanks, Dad. Becca will be so happy. I dropped her off at school, then went to work. But I couldn't stop thinking about this Becca kid. That afternoon, I got a call from the school. Mister Williams, we need to discuss something with you about Emma. My stomach dropped. Did she get in trouble? Did something happen? I rushed over there, expecting the worst. The principal, missus Davis, sat me down in her office with this weird look on her face. Your daughter has been bringing extra food every day. This Week and sharing with a classmate. We normally don't allow food sharing because of allergies, but we wanted to talk to you about the situation first. She explained that Becca's family was going through a rough patch. Her mom worked three jobs but still couldn't afford school lunches. They'd applied for the free lunch program, but there was a waiting list. Meanwhile, Becca had been sitting at lunch with nothing but a water bottle. Emma apparently noticed on Monday and just started splitting everything in half. Her sandwich, her apple slices, her cookies. She'd even been giving Becca her juice box and drinking from the water fountain instead. I was proud of my daughter, but also heartbroken. No kid should go hungry at school. I told Missus Davis I wanted to keep packing extra food until Becca's free lunch kicked in. He smiled and said that would be fine, but mentioned that Becca's mom had been trying to find me to pay me back. That evening, there was a knock on our door. A woman in scrubs stood there looking exhausted. Are you Emma's dad? She asked nervously. I'm Janet, Becca's mom. I work at the hospital downtown. She looked like she hadn't slept in days. He pulled out a worn envelope and tried to hand it to me. I know $40 isn't enough for all the food Emma's been sharing, but it's all I have right now. I get paid again on Friday. Her voice was shit.

I'm 23 and my family still cuts my food for me at restaurants. Not kidding. My mom will literally reach over and slice my chicken into bite size pieces while I'm eating it. Growing up as the youngest of seven kids by a huge gap didn't help. My siblings are all 10, 15 years older than me, so they've always treated me like they're living at family dinners. They still ask if I need help tying my shoes or if I remember to brush my teeth. My sister Amanda still tries to help me order at restaurants, telling servers she'll have the chicken nuggets without asking what I want. Last month at my cousin Abigail's wedding was the absolute worst. The whole extended family was there, aunts, uncles, grandparents, great aunts, family, friends. The worst, during cocktail hour, my Aunt Janet loudly announced that I couldn't have champagne because babies don't drink alcohol. She handed me a juice box instead. A juice box at a wedding? I'm 23 years old with a medical degree. Then came dinner seating. My Uncle Mark grabbed my arm and said, come on, sweetie, you're sitting at the kids table. I tried to protest, explaining I was an adult, but he was already walking me over to a table full of actual children. Eight year olds coloring on place mats. Ten year olds playing with action figures and me with my college degree and my Job that none of them bothered asking about. The kids kept asking me questions like what grade are you in and do you like our coloring books? I spent the entire dinner helping a six year old nephew cut his chicken while my family laughed from the adult tables, pointing and taking photos like it was cute. My cousin Kelly walked over during appetizers. Ah, look at you helping the little ones, she cooed. Maybe someday you'll be ready for grown up conversations. She patted my head like I was a golden retriever. The breaking point came during cake cutting. When the bride and groom finished their ceremonial first slice, they started serving guests. My Uncle Mark walked over with a plate and a plastic fork. A plastic fork. Let me help you with this, honey, he said, and started cutting my slice into tiny little pieces like I was a toddler who might choke. Uncle Mark, I can be careful with the fork, sweetie. He interrupted, taking it from my hands. We don't want any accident. Remember what happened at Christmas when you tried to use the good silverware? I hadn't dropped anything at Christmas. He was just making stuff up. The entire reception was staring at this point. Other guests were whispering and pointing. Some were filming with their phones. I felt my face burning with embarrassment. That's when the bridesmaid of honor walked over. She was this elegant woman in her 40s looking confused. Excuse, excuse me. Are you Dr Nguyen? She asked, staring directly at me. Everyone at nearby tables turned to look. My Aunt Janet burst out laughing like this was the funniest thing she'd ever heard. Oh, honey, that's just our baby cousin, she said condescendingly. She still figuring out college classes and living in the dorms, playing dress up as a doctor. Aren't you, sweetie? The woman's face went from confused to absolutely shocked. Ma'am, this is Doctor Engyen. She performed emergency brain surgery on my 6 year old daughter.

She wants you to share that. Well, alright. Well, okay. She's like a little older. Um, I don't know if you guys know, like how much you guys know, but, um, yeah, she's very proud that she's a cougar.

My brother Jordan married Nicole last year after a whirlwind romance. She always acted sweet around family, but something about her felt off to me, like she was performing rather than being genuine. I work as a barista at Grind Coffee, a local shop downtown. It's not glamorous, but I love the regular customers, and my manager, Kevin, is pretty cool about everything. Nicole knows where I work, but. And she doesn't. Every Tuesday, Nicole comes in with her book club friends. They order complicated drinks, leave messes, and tip poorly. Nicole acts like she's never seen me before in her life, which is weird, but whatever. I figured she was embarrassed about her brother in law being a coffee shop worker. Last Tuesday changed everything. Nicole walks in around two PM, but not with her book club. She's with this tall guy in an expensive suit, definitely not my brother. They're all over each other, kissing at the counter, his hands all over her waist. She's giggling like a teenager. I'm making their drinks, trying to process what I'm seeing. This woman is married to my brother, wearing her wedding ring, and making out with a stranger in public. Then she turns around and sees me behind the espresso machine. Her face goes completely white. She quickly steps away from the guy, starts acting normal, but it's too late. I saw everything. They order their drinks without making eye contact with me. Nicole whispers something to the guy and they leave quickly. I'm standing there in shock, not sure what to do with this information. The next morning, I get a call from Kevin before my shift. Hey, we need to talk when you get in. Someone filed a complaint about you. My Spino drops at work. Kevin explains that a cuss banner called corporate claiming I was unprofessional, rude, and made inappropriate comments about her personal life. I'm getting an official write up. I know immediately it was Nicole. She's trying to get me fired before I can tell Jordan what I saw. It's actually kind of smart in a twisted way. But here's the thing about our coffee shop. We have security cameras everywhere. Kevin installed them after some theft issues last year. And Kevin's been managing for 10 years. He knows when cuss there are lying. I explain the whole situation to him. How Nicole is my sister in law, how I saw her cheating, and how now she's trying to destroy my job to silence me. Kevin listens without judgment. Wanna see what really happened? He asks, pulling up yesterday's footage on his computer. There it is, clear as day. Nicole walking in with mystery man. Them kissing passionately by the windows. Her wedding ring glinting in the sunlight as she runs her fingers through his hair. Me behind the counter, professional the entire time. Never saying a word to them, Kevin watches the whole thing, then deletes the plaint from corporate system. This never happened, he says, printing out still frames from the video. But you might want these. Family dinner is this Sunday at our parents house. Nicole shows up in a new dress, acting extra sweet to everyone. She keeps glancing at me nervously throughout the meal. During dessert, she leans over with fake concern. How's work going, honey? No problems with difficult cause banners, I hope. You know how some people can be so unreasonable. The whole table is listening. My parents love Nicole. Think she's perfect for Jordan. My brother is completely clueless, cutting his cake with a smile. I smile back at her. Actually works been really interesting lately. We had the situation yesterday with a married woman who came in with her boyfriend. Really awkward when she realized her husband's sister worked there. The table goes quiet. Forks stop moving. Jordan looks confused, glancing between me and Nicole. What do you mean? Jordan asks slowly. Nicole's face is red now. She's just making things up. You know how dramatic she can be. I pull out my phone, show Jordan the security footage still frames Kevin printed for me. This is from Tuesday at two PM. Recognize anyone? Jordan takes the photos, his face changing as he processes what he's seeing. Nicole in another man's arms, kissing him passionately, her wedding ring visible in every shot.

And I already knew this was gonna suck because they've always treated me like garbage. They make these snide comments about everything I do, act like they own the place, and basically think I'm not good enough for their precious son. Right from day one, they started running our apartment like it was theirs. They tell me what to cook, when to clean, how loud my music could be. But the worst part was the stupid air conditioning fight that went on for weeks. It's been like 85 degrees every single day here, and I keep the AC at 70 because that's comfortable, but nope. They started whining about being cold, so I compromised and put it at 75. I'm already sweating my butt off, but whatever. I'm trying to keep the peace. That wasn't good enough, though. They wanted the heat on in 90 degree weather. The heat. I'd wake up in the middle of the night, literally drenched in sweat because they'd sneak over and crank the thermostat up to, like, 80 degrees. I told them to stop messing with it probably 20 times, but they kept doing it anyway. So yesterday morning before work, I grabbed a Roll of duct tape and put, like, 10 pieces over the thermostat. I even wrote a note that said, do not touch the thermostat while I am at work. In big letters. Pretty clear, right? I get home at six PM, and it hits me like a wall of heat the second I open the door. It's hotter inside than it is outside, which shouldn't even be possible. The duct tape is ripped off, my note is crumpled up on the floor, and they've got the heat cranked to 98 freaking degrees. 98! I checked the thermostat three times because I couldn't believe it. I marched straight to the guest room, where they're just chilling like nothing happened. His mom is sitting there filing her nails, and his dad is watching some cooking show. I'm like, dripping sweat already, and I go, why could you not follow the simple instruction of do not touch the thermostat? This is my home! I'm tired of you saying rude things to me. I'm tired of you treating me like a child and making your own rules for my apartment. You either need to respect me and my boundaries or go back to your own house. Mom doesn't even look up from her nails at first. Then she gets this nasty look on her face and says, you have no right to barge in here without knocking. That was not only an invasion of privacy, but you need to take the attitude out of Your tone. I've dealt with much bigger bitches than you before. That's when I completely lost it. She called me a bitch in my own apartment, after I let them stay here for free, after I've been bending over backwards trying to make them comfortable, after they've been treating me like dirt for months. She kept going on and on for, like, 30 minutes about how disrespectful I am and how I need to learn my place and all this other garbage. I just stood there letting her dig her own grave. When she finally shut up, I looked at both of them and said, get out. Pack your stuff and get out of my apartment right now. His dad tried to jump in, like, now hold on. Let's all calm down here, but I cut him off. No, you heard what she said. She called me a bitch in my own home. Get out! They started arguing that they had nowhere else to go and that I was being dramatic. I told them that wasn't my problem and they had one hour to pack their bags before I called the cops. His mom started crying and saying I was ruining their family, but I was done.

I even wrote a note that said, do not touch the thermostat while I am at work. In big letters. Pretty clear, right? I get home at six PM, and it hits me like a wall of heat the second I open the door. It's hotter inside than it is outside, which shouldn't even be possible. The duct tape is ripped off, my note is crumpled up on the floor, and they've got the heat cranked to 98 freaking degrees. 98! I checked the thermostat three times because I couldn't believe it.

She called me a bitch in my own apartment, after I let them stay here for free, after I've been bending over backwards trying to make them comfortable, after they've been treating me like dirt for months. She kept going on and on for, like, 30 minutes about how disrespectful I am and how I need to learn my place and all this other garbage. I just stood there letting her dig her own grave. When she finally shut up, I looked at both of them and said, get out. Pack your stuff and get out of my apartment right now. His dad tried to jump in, like, now hold on.

His parents showed up at our door in March without even asking. His mom literally called and told me they were coming to wait out quarantine at our place, like not asked, told me. And I already knew this was gonna suck because they've always treated me like garbage. They make these snide comments about everything I do, act like they own the place and basically think I'm not good enough for their precious son. Right from day 1, they started running our apartment like it was theirs. They tell me what to cook, when to clean, how loud my music could be. But the worst part was the stupid air conditioning fight that went on for weeks. It's been like 85 degrees every single day here and I keep the AC at 70 because that's comfortable. But nope, they started whining about being cold, so I compromised and put it at 75. I'm already sweating my butt off, but whatever. I'm trying to keep the peace. That wasn't good enough, though.

I told them that wasn't my problem and they had 1 hour to pack their bags before I called the cops. His mom started crying and saying I was ruining their family. But I was done. I went to my room, slammed the door and texted my boyfriend at work that his parents needed.

So I've been helping my older sister Brisa, plan her wedding since the day she got engaged. We're talking eight months of venue tours, cake tastings, and color swatching. Every shade of lush pink known to mankind. She called me her angel sister to everyone, bragging about how she couldn't imagine doing any of this without me. We spent every Sunday together working on centerpieces, dressing invitations, making those little favor bags. Never once did we argue about anything. Then, two weeks before her big day, we're at the final bridesmaid dress fitting downtown. I step out of the dressing room in this dusty rose dress she picked, and I watch her face just completely change. She goes quiet for the rest of the appointment, barely looks at me. That night, I'm meal prepping for the week when my phone rings. We need to talk about the wedding, she says, and her voice is ice cold. I'm thinking maybe there's a vendor issue or something. But then she hits me with, you're out of the wedding party. Actually, don't even come to the wedding at all. She tells me I looked too good in the bridesmaid dress, and she won't have me stealing attention on her special day. I literally laughed because I thought she was joking. We're sisters. I offered to wear a different dress, do my hair different, wear less makeup. Literally anything but She's dead serious. This is my wedding and my day. I don't want you there. I could have fought her on it, could have called our parents, made it into this whole family drama. But honestly, if she really felt that threatened by me just existing in a bridesmaid dress, then fine. I told her, okay, if that's what you want. She sounded surprised, like she expected me to beg or cry or something. That night, I started going through all my emails. Every vendor communication is in my inbox because I'm the one who's been handling everything. The venue, that's my boss's country club, and he gave us the friends and family discount. The florist, she's a client from my job. The photographer, charging $2,000 instead of his usual six thousand dollars. I designed his entire website portfolio for free last year. The caterer, the DJ, the bartenders, even the hair and makeup team. They're all doing this as favors to me, not her. My sister has no idea that every single contract is technically under my name. The next morning, I called Brisa one more time. Just so you know, if I'm not part of the wedding, I'll need to cancel all the arrangements I made through my connections. She immediately snaps back, good, I don't want anything from you. Anyway, she hung up before I could say anything. I don't think she had any clue what that meant. I spent the rest of that day making calls. For first, the venue. I explained that I won't be attending the wedding anymore, so I need to cancel the reservation I made. My boss is confused, but says no problem. Next, the florist. She's actually offended when I tell her what happened and says she wouldn't work with my sister now even if she begged. The photographer is booked solid and happily takes another wedding for that date at his full rate. One by one, I cancel everything. The caterer, the DJ, the cake Baker, who was doing a five tier for the price of three. I also canceled the two surprises I planned as a gift. I've been secretly paying for the premium open bar package and upgraded their honeymoon suite to the penthouse. All in all, I was covering about $8,000 worth of upgrades she didn't even know about. Each vendor I call is shocked when I explain situation. The cake baker actually says, after everything you've done for her. But I just tell them I need to cancel and they all understand. Some of them even refuse to work with her if she tries to. The venue calls her three days later to confirm cancellation. That's when my phone starts going off crazy. 47 missed calls in an hour. When I finally answer, she's hyperventilating. What did you do to my wedding? She screams so loud I have to hold the phone away from my ear. The venue wants $12,000 for a last minute booking. The Florist won't even return her calls. The photographer is booked. The caterer says they have no record of her event. I let her rant for a solid minute before I calmly explained that all those vendors were my connections, my accounts, my negotiations. You said you didn't want anything from me, remember?

My friend autumn asked me to hang out with her during her overnight shift at the pawn shop there had been three robberies at other shops in the area this month and an employee was killed at the last one. I got there at 9 as the last customer was leaving and autumn was locking the front door, explaining we'd only buzz in people who had items on them. The buzzer went off for the first time at 10:30 when autumn buzzed the man in. He walked up to the counter with this big smile, and he needed quick cash for a family emergency and had electronics to sell. But something felt off about how he kept looking around the shop instead of at us while he talked, memorizing where all the cameras were. While autumn examined his old laptop, the man walked around the shop, stopping at the case with the guns, asking if those were real. Autumn said yes, but they kept them locked, and he nodded, then asked about the jewelry case electronic section, like he was cataloging everything valuable. He came back to the counter and after a minute asked how much cash the shop kept on hand for buying items, when autumn looked up nervously and said it varied. He asked if we knew about Luna, the employee who died last week. The way he knew her name made my skin crawl because it hadn't been Released in the news, Autumn's hands started shaking, and she said, no, we didn't know her. He said that was good, because it would be traumatic to lose a friend that way, bleeding out behind the counter while the safe was being emptied. Neither of us had heard that detail, and autumn asked how he knew that. He smiled and said he paid attention to things. He asked if we were alone in the shop, and when autumn said the owner checked the cameras remotely, he looked directly at each camera and counted them out loud, then said, cameras didn't help Luna. My heart was pounding now as he walked to the back area where the guitars hung, running his hands along them, then to the tool section. Picking up a crowbar and feeling its weight, he brought it back to the counter and set it down, saying it was a nice one, good quality. Could probably open anything with it. He asked autumn if she'd ever been robbed before, and when she said no, he said, Luna probably said the same thing before that night. He leaned across the counter and asked if autumn knew what Luna's mistake was. We. We're both frozen, as he said she'd been too slow opening the safe, had fumbled the combination twice because her hands were shaking, and that made everything take longer than necessary. He said delays were dangerous for everyone involved. Adam's hand moved toward the silent alarm, but he grabbed Her wrist, not hard, but firm. And said Luna had tried that too, but the police took 12 minutes to arrive. He let go and stepped back, say, and he needed to make a withdrawal from the safe. All the cash and the good jewelry from the case. Autumn said she couldn't do that, and he said she could and would, because he'd asked nicely once already. He mentioned that Luna had said she couldn't open the safe either, but eventually she did. It just took some convincing.

So I gave him the 1950s housewife he wanted. I had been with Craig for three years when he completely ruined my promotion dinner at this fancy Italian place downtown. Women today are the problem with everything, he said, twirling his pasta. They don't know how to be real women anymore. They're always trying to wear the pants, competing with men instead of serving them. My grandpa had it right. His woman stayed home, cooked his meals, and didn't talk back. My wine glass stopped halfway to my mouth. Craig, we are literally here to celebrate my promotion. That's exactly what I mean. You care more about your stupid job than making me happy. Back in the day, women knew their place and kept their man satisfied. I looked around the restaurant where we were supposed to be celebrating my success. So you want a traditional relationship, like the actual 1950s? His eyes lit up. Finally you get it. Yes. A real woman who acts like a woman should, the way god intended. Okay, traditional it is. He reached over to grab my hand. See, I knew you would understand. Most women would get all feminist and defensive about this. The next morning, I showed up to breakfast in a full 1950s housewife outfit, complete with pearls and a puffy dress that covered my ankles. Good morning, Mr. Anderson, I said, putting his coffee down. He laughed. Okay, the outfit is cute. But you don't have to call me that. Oh, but I do. In the 1950s, a proper lady always addresses her man respectfully. His smile started to fade that evening when he wanted to go to his friend's party. I shook my head. Oh, no, Mr. Anderson. I can't share a car with you. We're not married. People would think I'm a prostitute. What? That's insane. In the 1950s, married couples needed chaperones. I will have to take the bus and meet you there. The bus? Just get in the car. That would make me a loose woman, Mister Anderson. He had to explain to everyone at the party why we arrived separately. At the party, his friend Kyle asked about my promotion. I turned to Craig. May I answer him, Mister Anderson? Craig's face went red. Just talk to him. As you wish. I turned to Kyle. Mister Anderson doesn't believe women should work. I will be quitting my job soon to focus on cooking and cleaning like a real woman. My mother failed to teach me that my only value is serving a man. Kyle nearly choked on his beer. Dude, what the hell? She's being stupid. Craig muttered. No. Mister Anderson believes modern women are broken. We think we deserve Equality when we should be grateful men even put up with us. I sat quietly, hands folded, only speaking when Craig gave permission. His friends kept staring at him. The real entertainment started at his company picnic. When his boss's wife asked about my job, I smiled sweetly. Mister Anderson says careers make women forget how to be women. Would you like my potato salad recipe instead? It's the only thing I'm good for. I spent the entire event walking three steps behind Craig, staring at the ground, calling him Mr. Anderson, and asking his permission for everything. May I have a hot dog, Mr. Anderson? Just take the damn hot dog. Is that a yes? I need you to say yes or no. His co workers started whispering. When someone asked why I kept calling him Mr. Anderson, I explained happily. Craig says modern women destroyed society by thinking they're equal to men. He wanted a traditional 1950s relationship where I knew my place. His boss overheard Craig. Did you really say that? She's twisting my words. Craig growled, oh, no. Mister Anderson was very clear. He said women should shut up, stay home, and give men sex on demand. The boss's face went ice cold. HR will want to discuss this on Monday, Craig. By week three, Craig was cracking. Can we please have sex? He asked. One night, I gasped to my girls, literally, Mr. Anderson, good girls don't do that before marriage. What would Jesus think? We have been having sex for three years. That was the old me. The new traditional me saves herself for marriage. He punched a pillow. Then came his mother's birthday dinner at Craig's favorite steakhouse. When the Waiter came over. I handed him my menu immediately. Mr. Anderson will order for me. Ladies don't talk to other men. Craig's mom's jaw dropped. Craig, what is going on? Your son wanted a traditional 1950s relationship, I explained down shyly. He says modern women ruined everything by having jobs and opinions. Craig Michael Anderson! His mother's voice could have broken windows. You're trying to control this sweet, successful woman. Mom, she's doing this on purpose! May I speak, Mister Anderson? I asked sweetly. Stop calling me that! But you wanted to be the man of the house. Traditional men are called Mister by their women. His mother yelled at him through the entire dinner, while I sat silently asking Craig for permission to eat each bite. On the drive home, he exploded. Fine, I was wrong. Please just go back to normal. I smoothed my dress carefully. Oh, Mister Anderson, A traditional woman never questions her man's first decision. It would not be proper for me to disagree with you. The vein in his forehead looked ready to pop as I smiled sweetly and walked exactly three steps behind him to his apartment door.

I had been with Craig for three years when he completely ruined my promotion dinner at this fancy Italian place downtown. Women today are the problem with everything, he said, twirling his pasta. They don't know how to be real women anymore. They're always trying to wear the pants, competing with men instead of serving them. My grandpa had it right. His woman stayed home, cooked meals, and didn't talk back. My wine glass stopped halfway to my mouth. Craig, we are literally here to celebrate my promotion. That's exactly what I mean. You care more about your stupid job than making me happy. Back in the day, women knew their place and kept their man satisfied. I looked around the restaurant where we were supposed to be celebrating my success. So you want a traditional relationship? Like the actual 1950s? His eyes lit up. Finally you get it. Yes. A real woman who acts like a woman should, the way god intended. Okay, traditional it is. He reached over to grab my hand. See, I knew you would understand. Most women would get all feminist and defensive about this. Next morning, I showed up to breakfast in a full 1950s housewife outfit, complete with pearls and a puffy dress that covered my ankles. Good morning, Mister. Anderson, I said, putting his coffee down. He laughed. Okay, the outfit is cute, but you Don't have to call me that. Oh, but I do. In the 1950s, a proper lady always addresses her man respectfully. His smile started to fade that evening when he wanted to go to his friend's party. I shook my head. Oh, no, Mister Anderson. I can't share a car with you. We're not married. People would think I'm a prostitute. What? That's insane. In the 19 50s, unmarried couples needed chaperones. I will have to take the bus and meet you there. The bus? Just get in the car. That would make me a loose woman, Mister Anderson. He had to explain to everyone at the party why we arrived separately. At the party, his friend Kyle asked about my promotion. I turned to Craig. May I answer him, Mister Anderson? Craig's face went red. Just talk to him. As you wish. I turned to Kyle. Mister Anderson doesn't believe women should work. I will be quitting my job soon to focus on cooking and cleaning like a real woman. My mother failed to teach me that my only value is serving a man. Kyle nearly choked on his beer. Dude, what the hell? She's being stupid. Craig muttered. No, Mister Anderson believes modern women are broken. We think we deserve Equality when we should be grateful men even put up with us. I sat quietly, hands folded, only speaking when Craig gave permission. His friends kept staring at him. The real entertainment started at his company picnic when His boss's wife asked about my job. I smiled sweetly. Mister Anderson says careers make women forget how to be women. Would you like my potato salad recipe instead? It's the only thing I'm good for. I spent the entire event walking three steps behind Craig, staring at the ground, calling him Mister Anderson, and asking his permission for everything. May I have a hot dog, Mister Anderson? Just take the damn hot dog. Is that a yes? I need you to say yes or no. His co workers started whispering. When someone asked why I kept calling him Mister Anderson, I explained happily. Craig says modern women destroyed society. By thinking they're equal to men. He wanted a traditional 1950s relationship where I knew my place.

Mister Anderson, good girls don't do that before marriage. What would Jesus think we, we have been having sex for three years. That was the old me. The new traditional me saves herself for marriage. He punched a pillow. Then came his mother's birthday dinner at Craig's favorite steakhouse. When the waiter came over, I handed him my menu immediately. Mr Anderson will order for me. Ladies, don't talk to other men. Craig's mom's jaw dropped. Craig, what is going on? Your son wanted a traditional 1950s relationship, I explained. Looking down shyly, he says, modern women ruined everything by having jobs and opinions. Craig, Michael Anderson. His mother's voice could have broken windows. You're trying to control this sweet, successful woman. Mom, she's doing this on purpose. May I speak, Mr Anderson, I asked sweetly. Stop calling me that. But you wanted to be the man of the house. Traditional men are called Mister by their women. His mother yelled at him through the entire dinner while I sat silently asking Craig for permission to eat each bite on the Drive home, he exploded. Fine. I was wrong. Please just go back to normal. I smoothed my dress carefully. Oh, Mr Anderson. A traditional woman never questions her man's first decision.

So I gave him the 1950s housewife he wanted. I had been with Craig for three years when he completely ruined my promotion dinner at this fancy Italian place downtown. Women today are the problem with everything, he said, twirling his pasta. They don't know how to be real women anymore. They're always trying to wear the pants, competing with men instead of serving them. My grandpa had it right. His woman stayed home, cooked his meals, and didn't talk back. My wine glass stopped halfway to my mouth. Craig, we are literally here to celebrate my promotion. That's exactly what I mean. You care more about your stupid job than making me happy. Back in the day, women knew their place and kept their man satisfied. I looked around the restaurant where we were supposed to be celebrating my success. So you want a traditional relationship, like the actual 1950s? His eyes lit up. Finally you get it. Yes. A real woman who acts like a woman should, the way god intended. Okay, traditional it is. He reached over to grab my hand. See, I knew you would understand. Most women would get all feminist and defensive about this. The next morning, I showed up to breakfast in a full 1950s housewife outfit, complete with pearls and a puffy dress that covered my ankles. Good morning, Mr. Anderson, I said, putting his coffee down. He laughed. Okay, the outfit is cute. But you don't have to call me that. Oh, but I do. In the 1950s, a proper lady always addresses her man respectfully. His smile started to fade that evening when he wanted to go to his friend's party. I shook my head. Oh, no, Mr. Anderson, I can't share a car with you. We're not married. People would think I'm a prostitute. What? That's insane. In the 1950s, unmarried couples needed chaperones. I will have to take the bus and meet you there. The bus? Just get in the car. That would make me a loose woman, Mister Anderson. He had to explain to everyone at the party why we arrived separately. At the party, his friend Kyle asked about my promotion. I turned to Craig. May I answer him? Mr. Anderson's face went red. Just talk to him. As you wish. I turned to Kyle.

Craig says modern women destroy society by thinking they're equal to men. He wanted a traditional 1950s relationship where I knew my place. His boss overheard Craig. Did you really say that? She's twisting my words. Craig growled, oh, no. Mr. Anderson was very clear. He said women should shut up, stay home, and give men sex on demand. The boss's face went ice cold. HR will want to discuss this on Monday, Craig. By week three, Craig was cracking. Can we please have sex? He asked one night. I gasped, clutching my pearls. Literally, Mr. Anderson, good girls don't do that before marriage. What would Jesus think? We have been having sex for three years. That was the old me. The new traditional me saves herself for marriage. He punched a pillow. Then came his mother's birthday dinner at Craig's favorite steakhouse. When the waiter came, Over. I handed him my menu immediately. Mister Anderson will order for me. Ladies don't talk to other men. Craig's mom's jaw dropped. Craig, what is going on? Your son wanted a traditional 1950s relationship, I explained, looking down shyly. He says modern women ruined everything by having jobs and opinions. Craig Michael Anderson! His mother's voice could have broken windows. You're trying to control this sweet, successful woman! Mom, she's doing this on purpose! May I speak, Mr. Anderson? I asked sweetly. Stop calling me that! But you wanted to be the man of the house. Traditional men are called Mr. By their women. His mother yelled at him through the entire dinner while I sat silently ask. Asking Craig for permission to eat each bite. On the drive home, he exploded. Fine. I was wrong. Please just go back to normal. I smoothed my dress carefully. Oh, Mister Anderson, a traditional woman never questions her man's first decision. It would not be proper for me to disagree with you. The vein in his forehead looked ready to pop as I smiled sweetly and walked exactly three steps behind him to his apartment door.

He had several, but his favorite was weird. He never took it out when it was raining. It was unbearable because I love going out. Why? Was he afraid of a little rain? No, he said the car was too powerful and the rear would slide out of nowhere. If your car slides when it's wet, maybe the real issue is the clown behind the wheel, not the horse. Haha that was good babe. What car was it? I don't remember very well, but the car was manual and the car was really low. Hard to get into. Ha ha. Manual? That's old car stuff. I think so too. He never let me drive it. The nickname was tomato because it was red and he said it sounded like the brand name. You should have been embarrassed by that name. Ha ha. Do you remember what the logo looked like? I remember it had something like P72. My ex said there were only 72 of those cars in the world. P72? Yeah, and I hated the noise. It sounded like a formula one car. It was super loud. His car was a D Tomasso P72? Yeah, that's exactly.

Because there is nothing more dangerous than a strong and independent woman. He remains focused and unimpressed. And most men want a strong and independent woman. Until we force them to level up themselves. Then suddenly we're labeled as difficult because we no longer turn to them to seek validation and for our mere existence. Listen, sis, we are not rehabilitation centers for poorly raised men. It is not our job to fix them. It is not our job to raise them. They need to come to us as a whole ass man. Because we are looking for a partner, not a project. And at the end of the day, we're gonna keep focusing on ourselves and on our glow up until we find someone who fuck it's right and treats us how we deserve. Because nobody has time for shitty coffee, shitty sex or shitty relationships. And if it's not bringing you income, inspiration or to orgasm, we don't fucking want it.

Going to be windy and it's going to be cool. And then you're going to hear me say this about 50, 11 times. This morning. We've got that hard freeze on the way, but the real cold settles in Tuesday morning. Don't disrespect it. You want to take care of your house as we have a hard freeze on the way. I've got temperatures up here for the next few days. Now take it to the floor Tuesday, Wednesday morning, that's when we're in that hard freeze territory. You can see the speeds. Three, six, nine. We're just fine. But a cold front's gonna sock it to us one more time with strong winds blasting in here tomorrow. We have a couple of cold fronts on the way and temperatures will get low, get low, get low, get low. Look at next week. Highs only in the 30s. Very likely we're going to see a hard freeze. And that's why you need to protect your home. To the window, to the wall, and basically everywhere in between, especially the pipes. And could we see a wintry mix? Well, it is possible. I know when you see this pink, you're like, ah, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet coming our way. Well, some sweet, some light freezing rain possible, but light is the keyword here.

Maybe coming in as soon as Sunday morning. He has to be the favorite. He's my favorite.

Well, I don't, cause I would be weird. But I do think it was so crazy that it really helped my character development. So when I was in middle school, I had a best friend, okay, when I was in sixth grade, we were like. We were like this. And I went to an international school, okay? So, like, basically, new people were coming in and out, like, all the time. Like, sometimes people would only stay for a year, and then sometimes if you're, like, local to the area, you would, like, stay there your whole life. So me and my best friend were like this. But then one year, like, the beginning, I think this was, like, at the beginning of sixth grade, or maybe even in the middle of the year, a new girl came, and she kind of started to join our little group and, like, okay, a trio. Like, I can do this. Then slowly I started to notice that they would, like, gang up on me, like, do two against one. Like, like, little things like hanging out at each other's houses and then, like, telling me how much fun they had, but, like, that I wasn't invited. And then, like, when you'd pick a partner for a project, like, they would pick each other and be like, but not me. We'll call the first friend T and the second friend C. So T&C started being like this and, like, leaving me out from stuff. And then it slowly became, like, they would just completely ignore me. Like, I wasn't part of the group at all. Like, it was just them, too. But then when it was separately, like, when I had a class with T, she would be really, really nice to me. And when I had a class with just C, she would be really, really nice to me. Very mind game stuff. And it got to the point where I was like, okay. Like, I don't do well with being bullied. Like, that's what I felt like. I was like, I'm being bullied. I've never been the type to, like, take it. Like, I need to, I, I need to stand up. Like, I need to say something, even if it means, like, I'm not gonna have any friends for the year. But right when I was deciding, like, oh, I think I'm gonna, like, just call them on their shit, like, I don't care if they completely ditch me and I have no friends for the year, like, I need to, girl, I need to stand up.

I have to show you everything she did, starting with cupboard No. 1 in the kitchen. You might be like, okay, she put your spices on the rack? No, girl, I bought this for my skincare. This was hidden away in my closet. And maybe I can find a screenshot of, like, what my cupboards used to look like, cause this was not it. And what makes it crazier, I don't know if this was an accident or what, but I'm pretty sure she did it alphabetically. Basil, chili, cinnamon, garlic powder, pepper, red peppers. Yeah, it's in perfect alphabetical order. So I found this, like, stack of hair bands on my vanity table, and I was like, where did you find these? Like, I get that you find hair bands when you're cleaning. This was, like, a lot of hair bands. Very shortly realized not only has our homegirl put in a damn basket in our cupboards, stacked and organized all my ramen, she has also put the proper clips on all of my pasta and rice bags instead of the hair bands I usually use. Also, grow up. He also made me a medicine box. Like, I just know she watched that back to college medicine box that that mom, like, built her daughter. Like, she pulled these from Every different spot of my apartment. Like, none of this stuff was, like, in the cupboard at all. Some was in my bathroom, some was in my bedroom, and now it's all in here. It gets better. She decided to give me baskets for my dishwasher pods and my trash bags hanging on the inside of my cupboard. You showed up with adhesive clips in a dream? Cause it just gets better. Dishwasher brush hung. And this was just a bottle of, like, Dawn dish soap. Put it in a soap dispenser. Let's take a trip to my bathroom really quick. Toothbrush now hanging on the wall. And what I love most about it, it covers a stain. You can kind of see part of it, but there's a stain on this wall from hair dye. The clip covers it. She also hung the towel that used to be wedged in between here and hid the other part of the stain. That's from hair dye. The next thing first, I was like, did she, like, leave me a note? Like, what is this? No note. She just started me a grocery list, ripped out a page from god knows what incredible stuff. The last thing. Like, this is why I. Look, I know she's a mother. She called me out so hard for this. Tell me, why the stack of unopened mail sitting on my counter? Judge? Because. Yeah, girl, like, right? Clock it. Why do I have. Why do I have so much unopened mail. And finally I was like, damn, did she do all that and steal my vacuum? Like. Cause I could not find my vacuum for the life of me. Honestly, at that point I was like, just take it as a tip, like, you deserve it. And then I find it. Hung my vacuum on my storage cupboard. Mind your business. If you see me making a 52 part series on how I fell in love with my cleaning lady. Uh huh. I'm coming for you, Kendra.

So I'm gonna teach you guys today how to lay your baby down and keep them asleep. Most babies fall asleep in our arms when they're really little, but the second we lay them down, they pop awake and it's really hard to get them back to sleep. So one of my tricks is to make sure if you're in this position where you have your arm kind of underneath your baby's back, that you reposition your hands first before you even try to lay down. One hand's gonna go behind the head and one under the bum. So I freed up my back so that my arms not stuck under the baby when I lay down. Next tip is to make sure that when you go to lay your baby down, you don't remove them from your body and just kind of bring them down. It triggers their moral reflex, which makes them feel like they're falling. So instead you hold your baby close to your body and you bend your entire body down so you're gonna go all the way down to the crib, all the way down, and you are gonna pull the hand from behind the bum out and you're gonna put it on their chest. So now I have one hand on the chest and I have one hand behind the head. I'm moving the hand.

Our childhood was like one never ending episode of that TV show survivor, okay? We are indestructible. We've never sat in car seats. Nobody's ever given us swimming lessons. We've all been either shot with a BB gun or stabbed with a fucking Jart. The television stations had to make a commercial reminding our parents that they had kids. I shit you not. Every night on the ten PM news, a voice would come on and say, it's ten PM. Do you know where your children are? To remind our parents that they had fucking kids. So, no, sir, shirtless with the beanie, sinks were not an option.

No, I didn't, because my daughter woke up in the middle of the night, looked me dead in the eyeball, and said, Mommy, I'm afraid of what's under the bed. And in my head, I was thinking, that's really fucking creepy. I, too, am now afraid of what's under the bed. That's not what I said, though. No, what I said was, honey, there's nothing under the bed. Just go back to sleep. Did I believe that? No. Actually, I'm pretty sure there was something under the bed, but I lied to her for her comfort. And then she asked me to check under the bed. And in my head, I was like, ain't no fucking way am I getting out of bed right now to check under it. Instead, I reassured her that there was nothing under the bed, and I told her to go back to sleep. And she tried for a minute. Her eyes fluttered. They. They, like, a little bit, and then they popped right open again. And she was looking at the TV, the TV that was turned off in our dark room. And she goes, mommy, who's that on the TV? And in my head, I'm thinking, dog, I don't fucking know. You tell me. You're the one seeing dead people. Who the fuck is that on the TV? Because I don't see it, but I'm terrified. I don't say that. No, instead, I Say, honey, the TV's turned off. There's no one on the TV. Just go back to sleep. And she falls back asleep eventually. You know who doesn't? Me. Because I'm afraid of what's under the bed now. And I'm wondering who the fuck that was on my TV. On my TV that was turned off. Who was it? And now I'm thinking, I need to fucking spray my daughter with holy water. Except I don't have holy water. What I do have is Dawn dish soap power scrub. I could spray her with that, hit her with a microfiber towel and hope that fucking works. I'm terrified right now. And I'm a little bit tired, but mostly terrified.

You. And then you have decades where you can't even go a singular month without your body turning on itself. And then you're supposed to, like, grow a human and have a catapult out out of you? No. And then your reward for decades of dealing with that is menopause. Not to mention the expectations of society on that woman who's now created a child with a chest to take care of, on top of being boss babe while maintaining her beauty standards. But, of course, not too beautiful, because if we're too beautiful, then she's dumb, and this is all that she's worth. And during all of that, having to keep their eyes out in parking garages for men. Meanwhile, boys just grow some hair, lose some hair, drink beer, and then have a meltdown when they don't get the attention they think they deserve.

Out here just acting like fools, chanting and laughing and clapping, thinking that you scored some kind of victory by taking Charlie's life. Well, let me set the record straight for y'all. In your poor, pitiful little souls, you haven't won a damn thing. But I'll tell you who did win. That's Charlie. Charlie isn't laying in some cold grave. His body, maybe, but he's not. Charlie is alive, more alive than ever. Because that faithful servant is walking the streets of gold right now. He is walking shoulder to shoulder with the Almighty god himself. Oh, and listen to me clearly. That man is feeling no more pain, no more sorrow, no more grief. Just eternal victory. You didn't take him down. You just handed him the prize that every Christian is striving for. So while you sick, disgusting people are out there chanting, we got Charlie, I want you to hear me loud and crystal clear. You didn't break him. You just crowned him. You just gave him the very thing he devoted his life to reaching. That man is up there rejoicing, while you're down here rotting in your own hate. Now, don't get it twisted. Down here, we are hurting, we are grieving, and we are angry. But that anger, oh, honey child, that's a fire. And that fire, it's about to burn hotter than you will be able to handle. Because we are gonna be picking up Charlie's Sword, we are gonna be strapping on Charlie's shield because we are gonna keep marching forward louder, stronger, and bolder than ever before. So you think you won? Well, congratulations. All you did was ignite the army. And that army is coming.

Shit. If somebody invades America, the Crips and the Bloods are gonna call a truce so that they can get the big toys out and call Geneva achievement. White women would ride into battle riding lions, tigers and bears. Well, Claymore strapped rumba swept the streets. There's a reason Pitt and keeps threatening to boom boom us with boom booms to make you see X ray before you go. Go! We have freaking cannibals still. Speaking of Jethro, he's still convinced that rules of engagement was overturned with row versus Wade. Hell, we have more guns than people. Dodging bullets has become a rite of passage. Just look at how we raise our kids up on caffeine and M Sixteen's playing call of duty. Then we send them into the war zone we call the American public education system. With no weapons, no means to defend themselves other than their fists. Here, Timmy, fight off the bullets with your bare fist and hope you can zigzag. Tell the quiet kids in this country start dropping bodies just cause you tease them. The fuck you thinks gonna happen when Timmy can't get his damn chicken nuggets and you took his internet out? Hell, the gangs in America would no longer make their money off the drugs illegally. They'd be arm medics and taking bets on kill shots. Don't even get me started on the unhinged ass millennials. The moment they can't Get their mood stabilizers. War crimes will become an art form and we'd run around like we play a Pokemon. Gotta catch them all. Americans will turn war into an extreme sport while the military stands back and records it just so that they can show the rest of the world the examples on why not to fuck with us. Geneva Convention would turn into a to do list on every American household fridge. We take that shit so seriously we have Comedy Central sending Kevin Hart to tell us rules for engagement. Racism in America would single handedly be ended as Billy Bob and Tyrone high five because they think they just unlocked the super secret Duck Hunt level with foreign pair of troopers. Should somebody please threaten us with good time? Invade the United States. Let us show you why the first color in our flag is red.

It turns out I had indeed not experienced at all. Couple nights ago, I hear my teenager sleepwalking. He does that sometimes. There's no waking him up out of it. I go to bed, think nothing of it. Then the next morning, Ryan comes running down the stairs. He runs into my room and he goes, I need your help. There is poop up the wall, on the floor, it's everywhere. And I'm like, what? And he goes, do you need me to get you a picture? Do you wanna see? It's everywhere. And I just look at him for a minute and he goes, can you come help me pick up your dog's shit, please? It was at that moment that I remember he had been sleepwalking the night before, and I turned around and I said, Ryan, um, I think you pooped in your sleep. The look on his face was something like this. What? And he goes, no, I'm pretty sure it was Charlie, our golden retriever. And finally I convince him that he clearly was the one that shit everywhere. So he goes upstairs with a garbage bag and all the cleaning wipes, and all I hear is this mom, I really, really. Hahaha. For the rest of the day, he is freaking trying to figure out how this happened at his age. Quite frankly, I'm a little mortified myself that My almost 16 year old shot himself in his sleep. Anyway, the next night, at around one in the morning, I'm in the bathroom getting ready to go to bed, when all I hear is an explosion of some sorts. Kind of like the Niagara Falls turning on for the first time. When I came out of the bathroom, I saw it. The crime scene of shit. My golden retriever had exploded in my bedroom. A huge disaster. I deal with it, and then I go to bed. So one in the morning, I'm not thinking yet. I start falling asleep. And then a light bulb went off in my head. It occurred to me that maybe, just maybe, it was not the teenager who shot. And that maybe it was indeed the golden retriever. The best part? In three years, my golden retriever has not once walked up those stairs. Because those stairs are terrifying for him. But that night, he thought to himself, oh, god, I'm gonna shit myself. If I shit on the carpet, mom will know. But if I shit in Ryan's room, right up against the wall and down on the floor, they'll think it was him. The golden retriever outspared to my teenager.

I woke up 20 minutes before my alarm, and I thought, this is great. This is great. I'm up early. I'm gonna take a shower, get the kids lunches packed, get him to the bus stop, get home and get some stuff done. You're an asshole, Amanda. You always believe you're gonna have a productive day, you optimistic sun, shiny puke. Just love yourself, girl. Just love yourself that. Yeah. No, no. Taking a shower, I heard the bathroom door open. My son's sweet little sleepy voice telling me he had to pee. Go ahead, buddy. Go pee. I heard him pee. I'm putting conditioner in my hair, heard the toilet flush, heard the sink run. And then as I'm soaping and conditioning my hair, he jerks the shower curtain open, and I feel something hit my leg. I hear the shower curtain close as I'm trying to quickly get the soap out of my eyes. And then I hear the bathroom door slam. Look down, but there's a plastic cup in the tub. Why do you put a plastic cup in the tub? Oh, god, this kid is so weird. I'm washing the front of my body, and I Feel something on my back. Now my hair falls out quite a good deal, so I thought it was a loose hair, but it was annoying, you know, it just. It was like that weird tickly feeling. So I turned my back to the water, and then I didn't feel it anymore. Cool. Got done showering. I'm ready to get out of the tub, and I hear the door crack. And my son says, did you see it, Mommy? See what, buddy? Did you see it, Mommy? Buddy, what did you do? Door slam shut. Oh, my god, this kid is so weird. Open up the curtain. As I go to step out, I look down to see a big hairy spider on my leg. My son caught a spider in a cup and threw it in the shower with me. Do you know how bad it hurts to try to launch yourself out of a tub, smacking at your leg and slam into the wall in front of you? Because I do. Do you know how bad it hurts to slip, trip, and fall on the floor and bust your elbow off that weird baseboard heater? I always get made fun of for saying it, but i'mma say it. The radiator. Do you know how bad that hurts to bust your elbow off that son bitch at 6:00 in the morning? Cause I damn sure do. Do you know how bad it hurts to try to flip over and Crawl across the bathroom floor only to get tangled in a towel and bust your face off a towel rack? Cause I do. And now when my son gets home, I'm going to get gentle, sweet revenge on my sweet little man. He's so cute! I love him so much hahaha.

I was like, babe, excuse me, do I know you? And in my brain, I thought she was a little lady of the night trying to make some coin. So I look at her like, oh, sorry, not my type. Like, I don't really do that. Thank you, though. Like, she looks at me, she's like, stop acting like you don't know me. Here, let me get in the car. I don't lock my door. And as I start to roll up my window, she looks at me with the most scared eyes that I knew something was up. She was like, please let me in the car, babe. We have reservation soon. And as she said that, something seems sketchy. So I looked in my rearview, and there was a man that was just scaring. He was acting like he wasn't, but he was staring. I let her in my car, drive a couple blocks, and she looks at me, she's like, thank you so much. That man has been following me for 30 minutes. I don't know what would have Happened then I dropped her off at her house because. Whoa.

He told him to quit being a fucking racist. And the kid put his hands on him, and my son gave him something to think about on the way to the nurse. Now, I picked my kid up from school and took him for ice cream, and my client says, stop telling your kids, if someone hits them, hit them back. You're part of the problem. Hmm? No, I'm not. I'm the solution your kid wasn't ready for. If you think I'm gonna send my child into school like a little lamb and tell him go get an adult in the midst of being mollywapped, absolutely fucking not. This isn't Daniel Tiger's conflict resolution. This is real life. I don't raise bullies, but I'm sure shit not raising a victim who stands there like, please stop hitting me. I'm emotionally aware. My kids gonna pop off like they've been waiting their whole life for the green light. I'm not gonna sit there in the principal's office like, oh, I told him to walk away, cause no, the fuck I didn't. I told him to aim center mass and don't stop until it's over. And if your kids started it, I don't care how it ended. If you want to raise your child to be a gentle negotiator, go for it. But if they bring that open palm diplomacy into A hallway fist fight. They're gonna meet my kids. Knuckle biscuits. I'm not sending my kids to school so they can work on their breathing exercises. Mid ass whooping. They're not gonna sit there like I'm feeling unsafe in my body right now. And if you think that way, it's cause your kid loses. Every fight they start cry about it.

Spider. Chucky. Chucky. Tell them. Tell everybody why I was afraid of Chucky. Well, one night I was watching Chucky on VHS when it come out, and he was a little kid, and he was around the corner watching it behind my back. And you got so scared, you went to your room and threw away that little my buddy doll you had. I didn't know what was going on. So I took that doll out of the trash and put it back on your dresser and went to work. Well, the next morning, your mother called me, and you in the background, screaming and yelling. And she told me the story. What happened? 7, 7 years old. And she told me the story, what had happened. So I thought it was pretty fucking funny. So I get home, and you'd already had a burial for this damn doll. You'd slice it up with a pair of Scissors and buried it in the backyard. So I waited. You went to sleep. I went out and unburied that doll, stitched it up real good and set it back on the dresser. And then. Nothing funny about childhood trauma. I went to work and waited for the phone call. Well, your mom called me, and you just said, so hysterical you couldn't even make a word. You just crying and bawling your eyes out. And then You burn that damn doll and buried it again. So the next night I unburied it after you went to sleep. You son of a bitch. I super glued the fucking burnt parts back together. Stitched up the little overalls. And you ended up. I was off the next day. See, it was. I took the damn dog, I tied a piece of yarn around it like this. And put it on the top bunk bed on that little safety railing. So when you woke up, you slept on the bottom bunk. And you woke up and it was right there in your face. You're so. I woke up screaming. You wouldn't even get out of the bed. You just kept hitting that doll with your belly. And this is the man you married. Younger stepmother. And you also bit yourself in the ass. Cause I ended up sleeping in bed with you till I was like 12 years old. No, baby, you were in my bed. You were in my room.

It's a saturated market. It's about the most saturated market you're gonna find. You can't throw a rock in a crowd without hitting three pieces of cheap Cooter.

A Dollar General toy, $10 worth of gas, and a little bit of attention. If you find one that thinks her shit don't stink, you'll probably have to spend 100 to 150 on a nice meal and you're still in there anyway, so you're good. Now, if you want to buy a bulk Cooter, okay, if you're buying Costco Cooter, this is how you do it. You're gonna go get a fifth of Tito's, you're gonna fill your boat full of gas, then you're gonna post about it. By Saturday, you're gonna have a boat full of Cooter, and then you're gonna make post about that. This is where marketing comes in.

Spider. Chucky. Chucky. Tell them. Tell everybody why I was afraid of Chucky. Well, one night I was watching Chucky on VHS when it come out, and you was a little kid, and you was around the corner watching it behind my back. And you got so scared, you went to your room and threw away that little my buddy doll you had. I didn't know what was going on. So I took that doll out of the trash and put it back on your dresser and went to work. Well, the next morning, your mother called me, and you in the background, screaming and yelling. And she told me the story. What happened? 7, 7 years old. And she told me the story, what had happened. So I thought it was pretty fucking funny. So I get home, and you'd already had a burial for this damn doll. You'd slice it up with a pair of Scissors and buried it in the backyard. So I waited. You went to sleep. I went out and unburied that doll, stitched it up real good and set it back on your dresser. And then. Nothing funny about childhood trauma. I went to work and waited for the phone call. Well, your mom called me. And you, as I said, so hysterical you couldn't even make a word. You just crying and bawling your eyes out and Then you burn that damn doll and buried it again. So the next night I unburied it after you went to sleep. You son of a bitch. I super glued the fucking burnt parts back together. Stitched up the little overalls. And you ended up. I was off the next day. See, it was. I took the damn doll, I tied a piece of yarn around it like this. And put it on the top bunk bed on that little safety railing. So when you woke up, you slept on the bottom bunk. And you woke up and it was right there in your face. I woke up the next morning and you was in there scared and terrified and screaming. You wouldn't even get out of the bed. You just kept hitting that dog with your belly. And this is the man you married. Younger stepmother. And you also bit yourself in the ass. Cause I ended up sleeping in bed with you till I was like 12 years old. So you're a baby. You were in my bed. You were in my room.

Like, why is it kind of, like, working really well? And apparently these are supposed to be super cleanly because you can continuously clean them and reuse them. you don't have to keep buying a bunch of puffs that contain bacteria and, like, hold on to all of that. I mean, it looks a little strange. It kind of looks like a, um. Never mind. But. But she's working well, so you know what? If the payout is worth it. Looking a little odd, I don't necessarily care. I mean, it's really saying no streaks at all. Super pale right now, too. I promise this is my normal color, but I have self Tanner on, so that's why my neck is so much darker than the foundation. But, like, she covered everything very well. Again, weird. Looks like a little arrow or like, you know, a dolphin or something. But she worked pretty decently, so I honestly think I would use this again. I'm not even gonna lie. Have you guys tried one of these? Have. What are your thoughts?
