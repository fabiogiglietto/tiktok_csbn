The son said it's pretty warm, but it smells like rotten eggs. The mother thought he was overreacting. She explained that the spring contains sulfur and minerals, which were good for the skin, detoxifying and beautifying it and even nourishing the kidneys. The son immediately started rubbing the water all over himself. The father didn't want to be outdone and took a few big gulps. He instantly felt refreshed. The four of them, eyes wide with excitement, didn't notice the warning sign nearby, a septic tank. They continued enjoying themselves. When the mother started applying a natural face mask, the two sons dove right in, trying to soak up all the nutrients. The mother went even further, applying the mask and taking a few bites. But the next moment, the eldest son pulled out a large wad of toilet paper from the water. Only then did everyone realize this wasn't a hot spring at all. They had been soaking in a septic tank the whole time. Terrified, the family scrambled to get out immediately. I don't like Griswold spring.

When the temperature dropped to minus 50 degrees Celsius, the tribal chief discovered that the bodies of sheep were warm. So he made clothes from wool and managed to survive the winter while three of his followers froze to death. On the other side of the globe, humans living in the desert wore long robes to shield themselves from the sun, which LED to a sweaty and unpleasant odor on their bodies. Later, a sheep appeared and people realized that even though sheep had thick wool, they didn't give off a bad smell. Thus, they made robes from wool. These robes were breathable and provided Protection from the sun. Then came the winter nights of the Middle Ages. During this period, people would wear a lot of clothes to keep warm. Unfortunately, it took them a long time to take off their clothes when they got home and they had to put them all back on again before going out. Fortunately, there were also sheep around. Sheep could adapt to both indoor and outdoor environments. As a result, people made woolen coats that were both warm and beautiful. Finally, in modern times, even if fitness enthusiasts wear very little, they can still be drenched in sweat and feel uncomfortable. However, if they change into breathable and sweat absorbing woolen clothing, the situation will be quite different. So do you know what else wool can be used? For

The women warn him coldly, if he wants to live, he must obey the Queen and serve the tribe. David is taken back to the castle by female soldiers. Strong build immediately draws everyone's attention, especially that of Queen Anna, whose beauty shines like Crystal. Her presence alone feels powerful and commanding. She steps closer to David, her eyes sharp as fire. And in that moment, he realizes this woman isn't just beautiful, she's dangerous. Soon he learns that her power is beyond imagination. Moments later, David collapses, completely drained. And when he begs to leave, the Queen tells him coldly that no man who has ever set foot on this island has survived. As night falls, the air grows heavy with tension. Her fiery gaze never leaves him. Her will completely dominates the room. By dawn, David is utterly exhausted, fear burning in his eyes. He finally understands the horrible truth. This is a forgotten kingdom ruled entirely by women. Men have long gone extinct, and the women here possess terrifying strength and an unending hunger to preserve their bloodline. Every man who lands here becomes their captive, used, rained, and left an empty shell. From that day on, the women began hunting outsiders without mercy, forcing any who survived to serve their cause. David, terrified of becoming the next victim, tries to escape again and again, but always fails. Until one day he gives up and chooses to surrender. But fate has other plans. During the next hunt, a horde of cannibals suddenly attacks from all sides. The warriors fight desperately, but they're overwhelmed. Queen Anna is captured and locked inside a dark cell. She struggles to break free, but there's no way out. Tears fill her eyes as she realizes the real nightmare is only just beginning.

Suddenly, a little girl crawled into my suitcase. Her eyes were filled with fear. I looked around and saw a man walking toward me. Sensing something was wrong, I quickly zipped up the suitcase. Soon, Allen walked up to me. He asked if I had seen a girl. I stayed silent. Alan seemed to notice something was off. He said he was playing hide and seek with his daughter. But I did not believe him, so I casually pointed in another direction. Before Alan could go far, I worried about the girl inside, so I open the suitcase again. Unfortunately, Alan saw it. He rushed over, wanting to check my suitcase, but I stood in front of it. I firmly refused Alan and told him I would call the police. Faced with my tough attitude, Alan had no choice. He could only watch me pull the suitcase away. But he did not give up. He secretly followed me. I hurried into a restaurant. When I went to the restroom, Alan followed me there. As soon as I brought the girl inside, Alan showed up at the restroom door. I quickly locked the door and pulled out my phone to call the police. After settling the girl, I decided to face Alan alone. When I returned to the restaurant, Alan silently sat across from me. Before I could say anything,

He lost a life, tried again a different way, and lost another. With only one life left, he took a risk and went down a hidden path. There, he witnessed something terrifying. Other tiny maxes were being crushed to feed the boss. As he tried to escape, the boss caught him, but Max managed to break free. The boss then sent soldiers after him. That's how Max lost his final life. But he still had one extra. This time, he sneaked into the storage room and found a few more lives. Suddenly, a horrifying face appeared, scaring him half to death. He ran straight into the boss's factory, shut it down, and escaped through to a hole. Without food, the boss turned into a skeleton. But another monster took his place and devoured Max. Inside the creature, he found a hidden stage where a roulette would decide his fate. It landed on the skull, but instead of Max, the boss vanished. His body ended up in the base, where Max saw a copy of himself. In a trance, he absorbed its head and his lives multiplied. Then suddenly, a creature trapped him. But it failed. The same level, too. Max restarted from the very beginning, and this time he finally cleared it, only to fall straight into a black hole.

Up ahead is a steep hill. Behind it, a bottomless cliff. To save themselves, a rich man grabs a poor man's hat and throws it straight into the furnace. To everyone's shock, the train suddenly gains a bit of power. The rich man rushes to the poor people's carriage asking for more hats. But the poor aren't fools. They hold on tightly to what's theirs. Seeing that, the rich man flashes a handful of cash. The poor glance at the money, and one by one they give up their hats. Soon they're trading everything they own for money. They form a human chain, passing items from the back of the train to the front. The conductor keeps tossing everything into the fire to keep the train running. Desperate poor begin tearing up the floorboards. Anything that could be sold or burned is gone within minutes, until only one thin layer separates them from the cliff below. When the last piece of clothing is handed over, the rich man suddenly pulls a lever and takes back all the money he just gave them. The poor lose their footing and tumble into the abyss while the rich cheer loudly in their fancy carriage. But then the conductor appears again and says the train still doesn't have enough fuel. Panic spreads among the rich. They rush forward, pounding on the engine in fear. With everyone's last bit of effort, the train finally stops on a Hillside. Just then, a couple walks out of the restroom unaware of what's happening. The man accidentally bumps a lever at the front of the car. The train suddenly shoots downhill. The force sends everyone tilting at a 90 degree angle. Those who fail to grab a handrail fall straight into the fire below. The blades grow stronger and the train bursts into the sky like a rocket. In the end, no one survives the explosion.

You can learn anywhere, Chris. You can learn by reading a fortune cookie. If you get hit by a truck, you learn not to walk out in the traffic. If you smack Mike Tyson, you learn that you are gonna get your ass whooped. But your parents are way too broke for you to go to college to just learn. They need you to go to college and learn how to get a Job. Besides, I think it's a little too early for you to be thinking about college right now. And why is that? Well, according to your test results, you have a lot of potential, but it's just gonna take time to develop. So what do we do now? I'm recommending that you take remedial classes. Remedial class. Remedial class. I can't go to remedial class. You're gonna go. How am I supposed to tell my mama I'm going to remedial class? I'll write a note.

He took the grapefruit and went to work. But halfway to work, he threw the grapefruit away without a second thought. He then took a pizza from the trunk and heated it up and ate it. But there was oil in his hands and Homer couldn't hold the steering wheel. The car crashed uncontrollably into a tree. But coincidentally, the company was having a meeting today. Homer panicked. At that moment, Cletus suggested that Homer should buy balloons to give to the leaders. Homer Learned that hydrogen was discovered by Cletus by accident when he was chopping firewood in the yard. He goes back to the office with the balloons. Burns can tell at a glance that they're pure helium. It turns out that the nuclear power plant spends a lot of money every year to buy helium. Homer tells Burns where they come from. Burns names Homer the best employee. He then goes to take Smith to trick Cletus. But Cletus pulls out his own wine and says he'll drink before he talks business. Burns drink and instantly feels happy. He then wakes up in his office in order to have cheap helium to use. He tells Homer to befriend Cletus. He then tricks Cletus into signing a contract. Homer wants to say no, but then he talks to thugs. Homer puts on some suspenders and befriends Cletus. Then he did something that made Cletus trust him, so he took Homer up on his offer to use pigs instead of human labor after a profound exchange of ideas. CLE it's really considered Homer a friend. He put Homer to the test with his homebrew. Burns sensed that the time was right. He took out a contract and asked Homer to trick Cletus into signing it. Cletus he plucked a chicken feather and stuck resin on it and was ready to sign the contract. At a critical moment, Homer had a moment of conscience and stopped Cletus. Then he told Cletus the truth. But Cletus forgave Homer when he Learned about it. Suddenly Burns showed up with his thugs. Eventually, Cletus resolved the crisis by a wide margin.

So if I were you, bro, I would be careful. He raised an eyebrow and explained that he was only there to get free food and to try to make me jealous enough to give her another chance. It was the stupidest thing I had heard. I looked over at my ex's face was super red with embarrassment and realized that it was actually true. I felt a serious rush of ego boost, but at the same time, I felt something unexpected too. Like, dude, call me stupid. But I felt pretty touched that she would go this far just to try to win me back. It definitely wasn't the best way to win me back, but definitely creative. So I told her jokingly that if she really wanted me back, she should try showing up here alone for another month to prove that she really meant it. I walked off to finish the rest of my shift. After that, she really did show up every day with a book or journal sitting at the same booth waiting for my shift to finish. I didn't even really talk to her much and she still came around. Weeks went by and on the last day of the month, she walked into Waffle House with a huge smile on her face. I walked over with her usual order and sat beside her in the booth. She asked me, If I would finally be her boyfriend again. I smiled back and said, absolutely not. I reminded her that she cheated on me with several guys and one of them was my best friend. She picked up the glass of water and thought about splashing it all over me. Instead, she splashed water on her own face to wake herself up and left, angrily ripping up one of the menus in the restaurant out of frustration before walking out the front door. The entire angry scene was crazy cute, like, ah, there goes my little Harley Quinn. I grinned and told my manager that I was finally quitting. I chased after her and apologized, saying that I wanted to get back at her a little for the horrible mess she put me through before I unzipped my jacket and wrapped it around her head to help her stay warm. After seeing water still drip down from her hair, I took her home that night and we talked about setting new boundaries if we wanted the relationship to work better this time. To this day, we're still together and no longer the toxic kids we used to be. Also for our prenup, we had a fun photo shoot at that same Waffle House, forever reminding us of our ridiculous and petty days.

I work at a Waffle House as one of the cooks and my ex girlfriend likes to come around and set up each of her dates there only when she knows I'm working. It had been four months since our breakup, so I didn't really understand why she would waste effort coming around and showing off that she could easily land a guy. It really bothered me at first watching her laugh and enjoy each date just like how we used to. I even thought about burning their food or putting something weird in. I settled for making their food extra salty for fun. After seeing the 3rd and 4th guy, I got used to it and just treated them like another customer with no connection to me. Eventually, my ex girlfriend settled with a guy I like to call Beanie based on the black and green beanie had he liked to wear on every date. They visit Waffle House about twice a week after class. I wasn't really suspicious about their relationship or anything until I was given a different shift. They ended up changing their meal time to match my schedule. That's when I started to really think about why they kept coming around and why they needed to go out on a date while I was there at work. Like, was I really that great of a chef here? So during my break one time, I decided to Walk over and ask them why they kept coming around to have a date specifically. While I was on the clock, my ex girlfriend sipped on her Sprite and asked, what do you mean? Are you saying we're doing this on purpose? I nodded and said, yeah, that's exactly what I was implying. She sighed and leaned back in her seat, crossing her arms before looking up at me and asking, are you just jealous? I sighed, feeling like I wasted my time and said, why would I be jealous when I'm the one who broke up with you in the first place? Her mouth flung open to argue back, but I tired my attention to Beanie and said.

An exhausted woman stood there clutching her purse, thanking mom over and over for babysitting. Behind her, a girl about 11 with dark hair hung back, clearly uneasy. Take all the time you need, mom purred in a voice I'd never heard before. The second their car turned the corner, something in Mom's face shifted into pure predator. She grabbed the girl's wrist hard enough to leave marks and dragged her toward Daniela's room. Welcome home, baby. The girl's confusion turned to fear. My name is not Daniela. It's Katie, she, I whispered. The sound of Mom's palm hitting her face made me flinch. You are Daniela, Mom shrieked. Everything accelerated into a nightmare. Mom commanded Katie to undress, but when she shook her head, mom grabbed the Scissors from Daniela's desk. Katie tried to bolt, but mom caught her by the hair. I watched frozen in horror as she cut through Katie's clothes with violent precision, humming Daniela's lullaby. Katie stood there exposed and sobbing while mom forced Daniela's tiny dress over her head. Bathroom became a torture chamber. Mom dragged the screaming girl in while I watched in horror. Through the mirror, I watched mom slather bleach on her hair. I want my mommy, she wailed. I am your mommy. Mom, god gave you back to me. In one desperate moment, when mom turned for more dye, Katie scooped bleach and smeared it across Mom's eyes. Mom's Scream was inhuman as she clawed at her face. Katie sprinted out and yelled for help. I flew downstairs and dove into the pantry with my phone. I whispered frantically to 9, 1, 1 while Katie sobs mixed with Mom's rage above us. Those minutes waiting for sirens felt like hours. When they finally broke down Daniela's door, they found mom sitting calmly on the bed, brushing both Katie's hair and the dolls. My two danielas have finally met, she announced it's proudly. Katie threw herself at the officers while mom fought like a wild animal, screaming, don't take my babies again, even as they wrestled her into handcuffs. The little girl's mom placed a restraining order on our family and Mom's been institutionalized 8 months now. Last time I visited, she grabbed my hand and whispered, I forgive you for sending Daniela away again. She smiled and for a moment I thought I saw a glimpse of mom I had before the crash until she mentioned another patient had Daniela's exact laugh. After that, dad and I cleaned out Daniela's room together and donated everything, including that horrible doll.

So if I were you, bro, I would be careful. He raised an eyebrow and explained that he was only there to get free food and to try to make me jealous enough to give her another chance. It was the stupidest thing I had heard. I looked over at my ex, whose face was super red with embarrassment, and realized that it was actually true. I felt a serious rush of ego boost, but at the same time, I felt something unexpected too. Like, dude, call me stupid, but I felt pretty touched that she would go this far just to try to win me back. It definitely wasn't the best way to win me back, but definitely creative. So I told her jokingly that if she really wanted me back, she should try showing up here alone for another month to prove that she really meant it. I walked off to finish the rest of my shift after that. She really did show up. Every day with a book or journal, sitting at the same booth waiting for my shift to finish. I didn't even really talk to her much and she still came around. Weeks went by, and on the last day of the month, she walked into Waffle House with a huge smile on her face. I walked over with her usual order and sat beside her in the booth. She asked Me if I would finally be her boyfriend again. I smiled back and said absolutely not. I reminded her that she cheated on me with several guys and one of them was my best friend. She picked up the glass of water and thought about splashing it all over me. Instead, she splashed water on her own face to wake herself up and left angrily, ripping up one of the menus in the restaurant out of frustration before walking out the front door. The entire angry scene was crazy cute, like ah, there goes my little Harley Quinn. I grinned and told my manager that I was finally quitting. I chased after her and apologized, saying that I wanted to get back at her a little for the horrible mess she put me through before I unzipped my jacket and wrapped it around her head to help her stay warm. After seeing water still drip down from her hair. I took her home that night and we talked about setting new boundaries if we wanted the relationship to work better this time. To this day, we're still together and no longer the toxic kids we used to be. Also, for our prenup, we had a fun photo shoot at that same Waffle House, forever reminding us of our ridiculous and petty days.

First off, stop saying my husband. He is your dad. Second off, stop lying. Mom, this weirdo is not my dad. He is your boyfriend. My dad is gone. And second, you always ignore it when I tell you what he does. Because you're lying, Helen. So you're just gonna act like you didn't see him sniff the chair? The perfume you were wearing smelled amazing, so I don't blame him. Or when he wouldn't stop complimenting me when I was wearing my new dress. He was just admiring your beauty, that's all. Mom, you can't be serious. I literally have a bruise on my arm. Here you go making up lies again, you. I slipped down the stairs. Helen, you're only doing this because you're mad I divorced your dad. So now you're trying to make my new husband look like a villain? Stop lying! I asked my favourite astrology app, Astra app, for advice, and it said my mom is a Gemini, and Geminis don't take serious. So I should show her proof so it's in her face. Mom, you know what? Since you think I'm such a liar, how about you come home so I can show you proof? You know what? Yeah. As soon as I come home, I'm telling Derek to come to the dinner table so we can talk about this. I'll be waiting. Well, after talking with you two, I do believe Derek did it. But It seems like you deserved it. Deserved it? Mom, are you crazy? This man is not my father, so he has no right to do anything to me. You were talking out of line. So you were disciplined? I told you to respect your elders. Mom, I am a whole 18 years old. This man has no right over me whatsoever. I can't believe you defend this. Are you that delulu? Watch your mouth when speaking to the woman who carried you for nine months. I had a long day at work, so I will be sleeping now. Goodbye. Mom, you can't be serious. Mom, mom, you'd never believe this. What? You're getting ready to lie on my husband again? Mom, I found a camp in my bathroom. Wait, what? How did you even find that? I unscrewed the head of the shower and I seen it looking right back at me. Your husband has been watching? Helen, I'm tired of you always putting the blame on him. He didn't do that, mom. What? This is literally his house we just moved into. Who else could have put it there? I don't know, but it wasn't him. So shut up and stop trying to separate me from my man! Mom, you can't be serious. Shut up, mom! Ever since you found this man, it's like you've completely changed as a person. You don't care about me at all or what's happening. You treat his kids way better than you treat Me? They get all the love and attention, and I get nothing but being told to sit in my room alone. You're letting this man tear us apart. He's clearly a weirdo. Helen, that's enough out of you. If you keep lying, you will be grounded for a year. I can't believe you. Mom! Mom, he's giving me that creepy look again. I'm so scared. It's just us right now. Helen, I don't have time for you right now. I am at work. Please stop overreacting. Mom, no, I'm so serious. He's being extremely weird right now. I don't care. Here. Mom, he just tried me, so I ran into my room and locked the door. Mom, please come home. I need you to come see the type of man you marry. Helen. What? What? Maybe if you stopped being so difficult, there wouldn't be a problem. Difficult? Mom, you can't be serious. Mom, he's about to break this door open! Honestly, Helen, I don't care. This is your fault for being such a headache. Maybe if you acted better, things like this wouldn't happen. Who do you think you are? Not responding to your mom, huh? Helen? Helen! Just got home.

Okay, is this, like, he has a pretty crazy search history that includes a kinky fetish type thing, or is it worse? No, it's worse. Um, so I was looking at his iPad because it's connected to his phone, and I had to reset our home, like, security system, and he keeps the code on there in his note section. So I was getting the code, and I noticed one of the sections in his note that was called Gift Ideas. So I was like, hmm, maybe I'll take a quick peek, see if he picked up on the many hints that I've been leaving. Um, so wait. So, wait, so you snoop? So you're a Christmas gift snooper, then? For shame. Yeah, I know. I'm a bad person, but, uh, anyway, I was looking, and I see some. Some of the stuff he was thinking about getting the family and friends, and then I see a name, staff. And I'm like, hmm, I don't know a staff. Um, and I see he was planning on getting her, um, diamond stud earrings. So who. Who the heck is this staff person? So, to your knowledge, he doesn't have, like, a cousin staff or a sibling? It's not his mom's name or his grandma? No. No staff that I can think of at all. And I'm like, well, maybe this is just a coworker. Or a good friend. But still, like, is it even okay for a married man to buy. Be buying diamond earrings for a friend or a coworker? I mean. I mean, it kind of depends, all right? I mean, if it's somebody, maybe they're retiring after many years of working with him. Or are the diamonds, like, teeny, tiny cheapos? Listen, but even if they are, I don't know if a married man has any business buying diamond earrings for another woman for any reason. Has he ever bought you diamond earrings? Yeah, but many, many years ago. Okay, but see, he took care of his wife first. Then I don't know. I don't think there's any reason why a married man should be buying diamond earrings for another woman. See, that's exactly how I feel as well. So. Okay, what do you want us to do then, Casey? I like to know who this staff person is and why he's buying her diamond earring. Okay, well, I'm not sure if we can answer the second question, but we can definitely find out the more important one, which. Who is this staff person? And. And I'm assuming we can call your husband? Yes, absolutely. Okay. And what is his name? I don't think you ever told us. It's John. John. Okay, so hang on a sec, and then we'll get John's number from you, and then we will call him when we come back next. Hello? Hi, can I speak To John, please. Can I ask who's calling? Sure. This is the Z Morning Zoo radio show on Z1O4. Nick, Natalie and Shaggy. Is this John? It sure is. What's up, everybody? Not much. How are you this morning? I'm doing well. I'm doing real well, actually. I feel a lot better if you're about to tell me I won something, though. Oh, yeah? I wish that was why you were calling. Actually, we've been doing something really special on our show this week called Sexy Secret Santa, and that's why we called you. Okay, so the way it works is if somebody's got, like, a special person in their lives and they're kind of, like a secret, they call us and tell us to wish them a very sexy Christmas. Kind of lame, you know? I know. But listen, we got a call from Steph about you. I guess she said you were a very special person to her, so. Who is Steph

Sleeps with me every night. She and was born on Valentine's Day too. Hahaha. It's been two months since you disappeared. I stopped writing to you because it felt like screaming into the void. Your mom's pregnant. Can You believe that? Guess there'll be another Elio around soon. I miss you so much, Elio. 10 months now. Your sister's almost here. Her name is going to be Julia. I keep hoping you'll walk through the door before she's born. Ello, it's been two years. I know that sounds insane, but part of me still thinks you're coming back. I can't move on from this. Everyone tells me to, but I can't. It's like a piece of me went missing with you. Hey. I need to tell you this. I'm getting married. I found someone who loves me. I think you'd like him. He's the love of my life. And I'm finally getting married. I asked for star rings so you'd be here with me in some way. I miss you more than ever right now. Ilio. It's been five years. I don't know what to say anymore. But I'm still here. They closed your case, the police. No one's looking for you anymore. But I'll never stop. I'm thinking of searching for you on my own, but in secret. Oh, and I'm pregnant. It's a boy. I'm naming him Ilio, after you. Hey. Wow. I didn't even realize we're still having this conversation. It's been seven years. My son's been born. Look. I think he looks a bit like you. He's as cute as you were. Or maybe that's just me imagining things. Wish you could see him. Hey, Elio. It's been 11 years. He's turning four today. Time flies, doesn't it? Feels like yesterday when I last saw you. He really admires you, you know. I always tell him how great you were as a boyfriend. He says you're still alive, that we're so connected. That's why I feel like you're still around. But I don't know. Sometimes I lose faith in you coming back. I wonder if he's right. I still feel you somehow, Ello. It's been 14 years. My new boyfriend tells me I need to move on. Says I'm holding on too tight. But my son, he still believes you're coming back. He's only a kid, but he has more faith than I do by now. It's been 20 years, Elio. Wow. My boy's nine now. He's getting so big. And guess what? I'm pregnant again. With a girl. She's due in four months, and I'm naming her Jula. Like your sister. Speaking of, your sister moved back in with your parents. She's not doing well. She barely speaks to anyone. It's like everything fell apart when you left. Elio, it's been 25 years. I built the house we dreamed of. Remember that? I also got divorced, though. He cheated on me. Now it's just me, Elio, Julia, and the cat. Still waiting for you, I guess. I miss you more than I can put into words, Elio. You have no idea. Every single day. Bria. The fuck you mean I died? I was just having some burger and fries. You're already planning my Funeral chill. You can now check part two by pressing share. Then more.

Good night, mystery girl. I'm going to get some sleep. Good night. What? I don't get a message today. Ah. Does someone miss me? In your dreams. I was just surprised how my crush since middle school hadn't messaged me today. I have a question for you. Sure. Ask away. How could you have loved me for so long if we haven't spoken ever? You are handsome. The way you talk to people. You are such a kind soul. Polite. You make everyone laugh. You are a gentleman. I always knew. You are what I always wanted. Now I really wanna know who you are. Patient. Hey. Hey. Can I admit something to you? Sure. I'm not interested in Violet anymore. Really? How come? She's beautiful. So beautiful that I was too scared to even go near her. That's the issue. She's perfect in every way. But I have fallen for someone else. Someone who I do speak to. Someone who understands me. Someone without a name or a face, but someone who loves me. The day you find out who I am, I Hope we will be together. Me too. Mystery girl. Can I confess something to you? Sure. What's up?

Is it yours? It's mine, of course, mom. Who gave you permission to buy it? No one. I used my own money and bought it. I didn't give you permission. How much did it cost? 700 bucks. Funny how you're spending 700 bucks while your brother needs 500 to fix his bike. My brother's almost 25. I worked hard to save up for this console. I help with rent every month. Do you love your brother? Of course, mom. Family always comes first. Yeah, right. If that's true, why are you being selfish? Your brother can't work. You know that. Why not? He needs time for himself. He's got his own things, like his gym routine and social life. I have a job and study, mom. Your brother deserves better. You're just not as responsible as him. I'm the one who runs errands and helps around the house. That's because you're older. It's your job to handle these things. I knew you always had a favorite. I don't have favorites. I just spend more time with him because he needs me more and I like him more. Now sell the console and give me the money. Your brother needs it. You can't be serious. I'm completely serious. No way. I'm not selling it. Either you sell it or you're out of this house. Where are your things? And where are you? I need the money to pay the rent. Your brother Didn't tell you? Tell me what? I moved out. How did you move out without my permission? I don't need your permission anymore. I don't live in your house anymore. He said if I didn't sell my gaming console, I'd be out on the street. Where did you go? You don't even have a place to go. You don't have any family left. The only family you have is me and your brother. I don't know if you know this, mom, but I work every day. Unlike you and my brother, who just sit on the couch all day. So are you living on the street? At least I'll have company. Company? You're ridiculous. I work. I rented a place for myself. What about the rent for this house? I don't know. Didn't you say this was your house? Now you can pay the rent. It's not my problem anymore. I didn't give you the right to talk to me like this. You don't have any rights, mom. Don't you see? You don't control anything anymore. The only person you control is my brother. Where is your place? My place is close to your heart. And where is my heart? It's in an empty place. Tell me now! We won't be able to pay the rent and the bills. Maybe you could get a job for my brother so he can help you with the bills. No. Your brother is a prince. He can't work. He needs to go to Paris. Why? So he can know what it's like to live life, to enjoy life, to have a good life. And I can't have that, right? No. Now tell me the address. I need to go there.

I'm Facetiming Logan, and I can't even hear him over you gaming. Okay, I'll be more quiet, but on one condition. If you stop making all those freaky sounds with him over Facetime. I can hear them, you know, it's just weird, Kyle. I mean, I'm willing to, like, turn a blind eye and not tell mom, but you have to promise that you won't bring Logan over when I'm here. That little chode pisses me the hell off. That's not fair. You're always home. Well, too bad. Guess Mom's finding out about your mysterious sounds at three in the morning. Wait. Okay, fine.

You never do. No, I'm being serious right now. I saw Logan with another girl at this party last night. Well, then it's not Logan. Logan's a senior, and you're a freshman. What? Would a senior be doing at a freshman party? Yeah, I know. That's the weird part. The girl he was talking to was a freshman. But it was 100% Logan. I'm sure of it. Like my personal beef with him aside, I don't think you should trust him anymore, Haley. And why would I choose to listen to you? I still trust Logan and he still loves me. What ever. Just know when he cheats on you. Or worse, don't come back apologizing for not believing me. Not happening, because he would never cheat on me. Haley, you have to break up with Logan right now. I already told you, I'm not listening to you. I don't care who you saw doing what. Haley, just listen for once. Remember the party that I saw Logan and the freshman at? You mean fake Logan? Yeah, I wanted to believe that too, but after today I'm 100% sure it's Logan. And why is that? I just saw the both of them at a cafe on like a date. Then when I made eye contact with Logan, he immediately got up and pretended he didn't know the freshman that he was talking to. If it wasn't the real Logan, why would he be scared of some random guy looking at him quickly? Maybe the guy just didn't wanna be seen talking to a freshman. I know Logan. He wouldn't do that. Oh yeah? Text him right now and ask him where he is. Alright, I will. Did you just text him? Five seconds ago? Yeah. How'd you know? I just saw him pull out his phone in the cafe. It's him. Haley, I'm sorry, but I did warn you earlier. It's probably just a coincidence. He just texted me that he was still at his house. Do you have his location? No. God, you're so naive, Haley. Kyle, what the hell did you do? I'm protecting you, that's what I'm doing. Logan just texted me that he's in the hospital and that a bunch of freshman boys jumped him so he couldn't hold off a few. Freshman? What? A baby? Oh my god. He said it was your friends. Kyle, this is too far. No, it isn't. I'm just trying to keep you safe from that absolute dirtbag. Don't talk to me again, Kyle. Why are you always trying to ruin my life? You'll see soon enough. Kyle, did the freshman that Logan was with have green eyes and wavy black hair? Yeah, her name is Rebecca. She also always wears this hoodie, I think. I can't remember how it looks like. Was it red? Yeah, that was it. It was a blank red hoodie. I'm sorry, Kyle.

You better lock your sweet Riley in a room or something, because it won't be pretty when I see that little brat.

My seven year old sister Daniela was singing in the back seat behind me when a truck ran the red light and slammed into us at top speed. By the time the car stopped flipping, Daniela became permanently silent. After hours trying to save her, the doctors told us she was gone. Mom climbed into the hospital bed and pulled Daniela against her chest, rocking her for three hours. Mommy's here, baby. Dad just stood frozen when the nurses pried my sister from Mom's arms. And while they fought, I threw up, knowing I survived and Daniela didn't. The first few weeks blurred together with mom crying in Danielle's room for hours. Dad would hold her shoulders and whisper that everything would be okay. I kept making her chamomile tea, but the cups always went cold on the nightstand. She couldn't stop staring at Danielle things long enough to drink them. Our grief therapist said this was normal and everyone processes loss differently. So we didn't worry when mom started making Daniela's bed every morning. Or arrange the stuffed animals in perfect rows, just how Daniela liked them. We thought maybe this ritual was helping her cope with the loss. The day Daniela would have turned 9, mom showed up with a wrapped birthday present, saying she'd already bought it before the accident. An obvious lie, but dad and I let it slide because what harm could one gift do To an already broken family. A month later, mom walked through the door carrying a life size doll that looked exactly like Daniela, with real human hair and her exact shade. She sat me down to show how she could brush his hair, just like Daniela's bedtime routine. I forced myself to nod, my heart breaking from the desperate sight. The next few days spiraled out of control. Mom dressed the doll in new outfits every morning and took it everywhere in Daniela's wagon. She did both voices like the doll could actually respond. People at the mall grabbed their children and hurried away from us. Dad found the three thousand dollar credit card charge. When he confronted her, she clutched the doll, screaming, you can't put a price on our daughter! He started sleeping on the couch that night. Things got worse when she pulled me out of school claiming it was too dangerous. She set up homeschooling with three play settings at our kitchen table. Week after week, I sat there watching her teach that doll alongside me. Until one morning I couldn't take it anymore. One morning I finally snapped and said, stop it! Daniela is gone! Mom sobbed. You abandoned her in that car and now you're doing it again! The guilt hit me so hard I couldn't breathe. I'm here too, I mumbled, while she cradled that doll like a real child, while tears streamed down her face. Two weeks after dad left, mom started Acting strange, she'd leave the doll behind and disappear, returning with stories about her wonderful new friend and the woman's precious daughter. I found her phone with Daniela's photo replaced by a stranger's child. She has Daniela's exact laugh, mom said. Behind me, her eyes.

An exhausted woman stood there clutching her purse, thanking mom over and over for babysitting. Behind her, a girl about 11 with dark hair hung back, clearly uneasy. Take all the time you need, mom purred in a voice I'd never heard before. The second their car turned the corner, something in Mom's face shifted into pure predator. She grabbed the girl's wrist hard enough to leave marks and dragged her toward Daniela's room. Welcome home, baby. The girl's confusion turned to fear. My name is not Daniela. It's Katie, she, I whispered. The sound of Mom's palm hitting her face made me flinch. You are Daniela, Mom shrieked. Everything accelerated into a nightmare. Mom commanded Katie to undress, but when she shook her head, mom grabbed the Scissors from Daniela's desk. Katie tried to bolt, but mom caught her by the hair. I watched frozen in horror as she cut through Katie's clothes with violent precision, humming Daniela's lullaby. Katie stood there exposed and sobbing while mom forced Daniela's tiny dress over her head. Bathroom became a torture chamber. Mom dragged the screaming girl in while I watched in horror. Through the mirror, I watched mom slather bleach on her hair. I want my mommy, she wailed. I am your mommy. Mom, god gave you back to me. In one desperate moment, when mom turned for more dye, Katie scooped bleach and smeared it across Mom's eyes. Mom's Scream was inhuman. As she clawed at her face, Katie sprinted out and yelled for help. I flew downstairs and dove into the pantry with my phone. I whispered frantically to 9, 1, 1 while Katie sobs mixed with Mom's rage above us. Those minutes waiting for sirens felt like hours. When they finally broke down Daniela's door, they found mom sitting calmly on the bed, brushing both Katie's hair and the dolls. My two danielas have finally met, she announced proudly. Katie threw herself at the officers while mom fought like a wild animal, screaming, don't take my babies again, even as they wrestled her into handcuffs. The little girl's mom placed a restraining order on our family and Mom's been institutionalized 8 months now. Last time I visited, she grabbed my hand and whispered, I forgive you for sending Daniela away again. She smiled and for a moment I thought I saw a glimpse of mom I had before the crash until she mentioned another patient had Daniela's exact laugh. After that, dad and I cleaned out Daniela's room together and donated everything, including that horrible doll.

I bet he had to take his car to therapy just to feel like it was fast enough to compensate for everything else. He was like, that was good. What car did he have? It had 2 doors and was really loud. Had to roll up the windows because of the noise. Yeah, cars are like that. Unlike my BMW, which whistles, his car didn't even drift. He just accelerated, but not too much because he always said he couldn't speed in the city. That's just an excuse for a weak car. And it only had one gear. How can a car. Be powerful with just one gear. Wait, you said one gear? Yeah. He never let me drive it. But how hard can it be to drive a car with one gear? What was the car like? The name was something hard to say. What's the name? I don't remember very well, but he always called the car Roger. Roger? Yes. It was very ugly. It had a ghost logo. His car was a Kenny Zeggregira. Yes, that's it.

Take some medicine and quit whining to me about it. Mom, people at school said my arm looks really serious, like it could end me. My teacher called, but you didn't answer. Your teachers always make things seem worse than they are. Stop making a Big deal. Out of everything, mom, my arm changed color today. It's dark purple and parts are turning black. I feel sick just looking at it. Good. You deserve it for always getting yourself into trouble. Maybe you'll learn something now. Mom, I can't feel my arm at all. It doesn't even feel attached anymore, like it's just hanging there. Then deal with it. Stop bothering me with your pathetic problems. Mom, my arm looks really bad, please. The skin doesn't look right. You probably did something to make it worse. Don't expect me to fix your mistakes, mom, my arm feels loose, like it's barely hanging on anymore. I can barely move without feeling like it'll fall off. Then stop moving around and sit still. You're embarrassing me. Enough already, mom. Please help. Oh, my god.

I I think that men should not hit women. Yeah. Even if a girl hits you as hard as they can. What about is it wrong for the girl? No, I don't think so. He's expected to control his rage and his emotions and his like, hmm, but the woman, she just got mad head. Okay. If you think about it, right? Like I think that's one of the question the questionnaire like are men physically stronger than women? Wait, have you ever hit somebody? I have. Like a guy? Yeah. And did he hit you first? No. That's a position of privilege, right? I don't really understand why they have it. You want Equality and egalitarianism. The idea here is going to be based around the fact that chivalry is gone. We are now equals. So if a man hits you in the face and you can punch them back, why is it if a woman punches you in the face you can't punch her back? That actually doesn't make any sense. I'm saying is that men are physically stronger than women like for example, men are physically stronger than other men. So if a man who is less strong than me punches me in the face and I punch him back, I'm still punching somebody weaker than me in the face. Why Is that not socially acceptable to punch a woman who's weaker? That makes no sense.

I'm sure we'd like to make this right. What would it take? I'd already started my new job. Better office, better salary, a boss who said thank you. Nothing. I told the VP, but you should know, Derek's been taking credit for deals. He didn't close my deals. If you check the emails, the contracts, you'll see my name, not his. There was a long pause. We'll look into that. Day 8, the calls escalated. The Harrington account had questions. Payments were delayed. They've been working with me, not Derek. They wanted me back on the account or they'd walk. Derek called six times that day. I ignored everyone. Day 9, my former colleague Sarah texted me, Derek just got fired. They brought in all his clients. Half of them said they only worked with the company because of you. The VP found the emails. You mentioned Derek had been falsifying reports for two years. I smiled, didn't respond. Week 2, at my new job, I closed a 1.8 million dollar deal. My new boss called me into his office. I'm impressed. That's exceptional work. Thank you, I said. It's nice to be appreciated. Week 3, Derek showed up at my new office building. Security called me. I went down to the lobby. He looked smaller, somehow deflated. I made a mistake. He, I underestimated you. Yes, you did. Can you help me? I'm struggling to find work. Your reputation followed you. I said, turns out when you take credit, For other people's wins. Those people remember I can put in a good word somewhere. I considered it for about two seconds. Eric, anyone could do your job. You're easily replaceable. His face fell. That's not fair. Fair, I smiled. You spent years making people feel worthless, stealing credit, breaking them down. And now that you're on the other side, you want fairness? I turned to walk away. Wait, he called out. What do I do now? Learn, I said over my shoulder. Learn that people aren't replaceable. Relationships matter. Respect matters. And when you treat people like they're nothing, don't be surprised when they prove you wrong. I never saw Derek again. Heard through the Grapevine, he took a job three levels below where he'd been heard. His new boss was exactly like he used to be. Karma's funny that way. Six months later, I got promoted. My team closed $12 million in deals that quarter. At the Celebration dinner, my boss raised a glass to irreplaceable people. I smiled and thought of Derek, of his smirk, of his cruelty. Anyone can do your job. He'd meant it as an insult, as a way to keep me small. Instead, it became the push I needed to realize my worth and to find people who saw it too replaceable, not even close.

You're easily replaceable. I nodded, finished my coffee, and walked out. One week later, he called, begging, but I just laughed. Anyone could do your job. You're easily replaceable. My boss, Derek, said it in front of the entire sales team, 12 people watching. He leaned back in his chair, smirking. We've got 50 resumes for every position. Don't ever think you're special. This wasn't new. Derek had a pattern. Public humiliation, power plays. He built his management style on making people feel small. Most people took it, followed their pride, stayed because they needed the paycheck. I used to be one of them. But three months earlier, something changed. I closed the Harrington account. $2.4 million, our biggest deal in five years. Derek took credit in the executive meeting, told the VP it was his strategy, his relationship building. My name never came up. When I confronted him privately, he laughed. That's how this works. I'm the manager. Your wins are my wins. Get used to it or leave. I didn't leave. Not then. Instead, I started documenting everything. Every client I brought in, every relationship I built, every deal I closed. I backed up emails, saved contracts with my signature, recorded call logs. Then I started making calls discreetly. To competitors, to former colleagues who'd escape Derek's department, to recruiters who specialized in enterprise sales. By the time Derek said I was replaceable, I had three job offers. Each one paid more. Better titles, better bosses. But I wasn't ready to leave yet. Not until Derek understood exactly what he was losing. So when he said those words, anyone could do your job. I just nodded, finished my coffee, stood up and said, you're right, Derek. Anyone can do my job. Good luck finding them. I walked out of the conference room, grabbed my personal items from my desk. Laptop, photos, the signed baseball from the Harrington deal that Derek didn't know about. In 15 minutes, I was gone. No two weeks notice, no dramatic speech. Just gone. The first call came two days later. Derek's assistant. There's been a misunderstanding. Derek wants to talk. I declined. The second call came on Day 4. Derek himself. Look, maybe I was too harsh. Let's grab coffee and work this out. I told him I'd already accepted another position. He sputtered. You can't just leave. We have active deals. Exactly. I said, you do? Hope you can close them.

So I showed the board her portfolio of Instagram filters and motivational quotes. The email came on a Tuesday morning. We need to talk about bringing Amanda on full time. Conference room at 2. I stared at the message from Kyle, my business partner. We'd started the marketing agency together four years ago, built it from nothing to $2.3 million in annual revenue, 12 employees, real clients, real growth. Amanda was Kyle's wife. She help with some social media posts when we first launched, mostly Instagram stories, inspirational quotes over sunset photos. I walked into the conference room at 2. Kyle was already there, so was Amanda. Thanks for meeting, Kyle said. We've been talking and Amanda wants to come on board full time. Doing what? Creative director. Amanda said she had a folder, actual printed materials. I've been developing a vision for where the agency should go. We need to elevate our brand presence. She opened the folder. Inside were printouts of Instagram posts, motivational quotes and cursive fonts. Choose joy, hustle harder, dream big. This is our current aesthetic, she said. It's fine for where we were, but if we want to compete with the big agencies, we need to be bold, disruptive. Look at Kyle. He was notting along. What kind of role are you thinking, I asked. Creative director. I'd oversee all client campaigns, manage the design team, set the visual direction. For the company, we already have a creative director, Maria. She's been with us three years. Maria is talented, Amanda said, but she doesn't have the strategic vision we need to scale. Maria had a degree from Parsons, 10 years of agency experience. She'd won two regional Addy Awards for campaign she'd LED for us. What's your background? I asked Amanda. I have an associate degree in communications and I've been managing my personal brand for six years. 23,000 Instagram followers. Managing your personal brand? Yes. Content strategy, visual identity, audience engagement. It's the same skill set just applied to corporate clients. Kyle cleared his throat. The salary would be $95,000, same as Maria. My stomach dropped. 95,000. It's market rate for a creative director. What companies? We looked at industry standards, Amanda said. Glass Door shows creative directors at agencies our size making between 85 k and 110 k. Those are people with portfolios, with client work, with degrees. Amanda's face hardened. I have a portfolio. She pulled out more pages, Instagram posts from her personal account. A mood board she made on Canva, a list of brand values that included authenticity and empowerment.

So I went to this Applebee's last Friday night around eight PM I get seated at this booth near the back and my waiter comes over. Guy looked like he was in his early 20s, kind of scrawny with this patchy beard. He takes my drink order, just a Coke, and disappears. For like 15 minutes I'm sitting there looking around, watching other tables get their food and I'm still waiting for my damn soda. Finally, he shows up with my Coke, doesn't even apologize, just flops it down and asks what I want to eat. I order the chicken tenders with honey mustard and seasoned fries. Pretty basic stuff. He writes it down and vanishes again. 20 minutes go by, nothing. I can see him at the computer terminal just standing there scrolling on his phone. Other waiters are running around actually doing their jobs, but this guy is just chilling. I try to get his attention a couple times, but he's completely ignoring my section. After another 10 minutes, I flag down a different waitress, older lady with gray hair who looked like she actually cared about her job. I asked her if she knows what happened to my food order. She looks confused and goes to check. Turns out my waiter never even put my order in the system. The lady, her name tag said Janet, looked embarrassed as hell. She apologizes and immediately puts my order In says the kitchen will rush it. But now I've been sitting there for almost an hour with nothing but a warm Coke. My food finally comes out, but guess who brings it? Not my original waiter. Janet brings it over with another apology. The chicken tenders are overcooked and the fries are cold. At this point, I'm just hungry and tired, so I eat it anyway. The whole time I'm eating, I can see my waiter at the bar area talking to some girl who's clearly not working there. He's completely forgotten I exist. Never checked on me once after taking my drink order, never refilled my Coke, never even walked past my table. When I'm done eating, I have to wave down Janet again to get my check. He brings it over and I can tell she feels bad about the whole situation. The total was like 18 bucks. Here's where it gets interesting. Janet hands me the check and quietly says, don't worry about tipping Tommy. He didn't earn it tonight and everyone saw what happened. Apparently, this wasn't the first time this kid had pulled this crap. So I pay my $18 cash exact change and leave zero tip as I'm walking.

I know that sounds weird coming from a white girl, but hear me out. This whole thing started about three years ago when I was living in Atlanta for my internship. My usual salon back home was, like, four hours away, and I was desperate for a trim because my hair looked like I stuck my finger in an electrical socket. My roommate Keisha, was getting ready to head out to her salon and saw me struggling with my massive curls in the bathroom mirror. She just laughed and said, girl, come with me. My stylist will sort you out. I was hesitant because I'd never been to a black salon before, but honestly, my hair was so bad, I would have tried anything. Walking into that salon was like entering a whole different world. The energy was incredible. Everyone was talking, laughing, music playing, kids running around while their moms got their hair done. It felt alive in a way that the quiet, sterile salons I was used to never did. The stylist, Miss Janet, took one look at my hair and shook her head, baby, who's been cutting your hair? Because they need to stop. She started running her fingers through it, asking me about my routine, what products I used, how I dried it. Nobody had ever asked me those questions before. They just wet it, cut it, and send me on my way. Miss Janet spent two hours on my hair. Two hours. He deep conditioned it, trimmed each curl individually, showed me how to scrunch it properly, and sent me home with specific instructions about what products to use and how often to wash it. My hair looked better than it ever had in my entire life. But here's the thing that really got me. She charged me $40. 40. The salon back home charged

Our other neighbor looked genuinely confused. You mean the happy sounds? My kids love hearing it. They think he's having the best time out there. They asked me when he's coming out to play. That's not happiness. The woman was losing it. Now that's a disturbance that needs professional intervention. My other neighbor smiled. My brother's autistic. What you're describing is completely normal and healthy. The husband tried to salvage things. Look, we're all reasonable adults here. We're just looking for some kind of compromise. Quieter hours, maybe? My wife stepped forward. Should we drug our child into silence so you're comfortable? Is that what you want? We're not saying that at all. He backed up. Just better timing for outdoor activities when fewer people are around. He goes out when he needs to, and we're not scheduling his emotions around your convenience. The woman grabbed her papers and clutched them tight. Fine. The HOA will handle you people, since you clearly have zero respect for this neighborhood. She stormed off down the driveway. Her husband followed, looking embarrassed. Three days later, the HOA sent us a letter about noise complaints and threatening behavior. I called the president immediately. He let out this long, exhausted sigh when I explained the situation. She's been emailing me multiple times every day for weeks now. I keep telling her a kid playing in his own yard isn't a violation of anything. She wants us to create New rules, specifically about this. She threatening to sue the HOA if we don't take action. I told her that's not how any of this works. Last week, I saw her at the grocery store yelling at a teenage cashier about expired coupons. Her daughter was standing right there looking mortified. The girl spotted my son down the aisle, and her face lit up. She waved at him. He waved back with a shy smile. The neighbor's head whipped around. She snatched her daughter's hand and yanked her toward the exit. She stared us down with pure hatred as she dragged her kid out the door. A month later, a for sale sign appeared in their front yard. The realtor came by our house one afternoon. I wanted to give you advanced notice that we'll be doing showings this weekend. Would it be possible to keep things quiet during those times? Keep what quiet, exactly? Your son. The previous owners mentioned he can be quite loud, and I'd prefer potential buyers don't hear anything that might impact her decision. My son lives here. He'll be doing whatever he normally does. She tried to force a smile. I completely understand. But maybe just for a few hours on Saturday and Sunday. I said no and shut the door. They ended up selling below asking price after three months.

My neighbor banged on my door at 7:00am. Your son screams every weekend and I'm done being polite about it. What are you talking about? The noise from your backyard. It happens every Saturday and Sunday like clockwork. The whole street hears it and my daughter thinks someone is dying over here. My son has autism and when he gets overwhelmed, he needs to let it out somewhere safe. Our backyard is private. I don't care what he has. She cut me off hard. This affects everyone and my daughter is having nightmares about it. Then tell her some kids express themselves differently. I'm not explaining your problems to my child. She shot back. That's not my job as a parent. Her husband appeared behind her. We've tried to be understanding, but this can't continue like this. You've never said anything to us before. He held up his phone. I've been recording everything and sending it to the HOA for two months. Now we have documentation. You're recording my son for evidence. He said it flatly. This isn't normal behavior and you know it. My son came to the door holding his tablet. He looked scared from all the yelling. The neighbor stepped backward fast. See, even the way he moves is disturbing. Something's not right here. He started humming quietly. That's what he does when he's anxious. She pointed right at him. That sound Right there. Hours of that every single day through our fence. I can hear it in my kitchen. He's 10 years old. He's not hurting anyone. My voice was getting tight. Her face turned bright red. My daughter can't sleep at night because she thinks your house is haunted, she told her entire class at school. I had to go in and talk to the teacher, maybe explain that people are different instead of making him sound like a monster. She nearly yelled. I shouldn't have to teach my kid about your family's issues. That's on you. My wife pushed past me into the doorway. Our son exists and that's not negotiable. You need to leave our property. The neighbor pulled out more papers from her pocket. I spoke to a lawyer about noise ordinances and disturbance laws. We have grounds here. You're threatening to sue us because our kid plays in his own yard. If you can't control him, maybe you should consider moving somewhere more appropriate for your situation. She said it like she'd been planning that line. My son's humming got louder and he started rocking side to side. She pointed again with this triumphant look. This is exactly what I mean. This is what we deal with constantly. Our other neighbor jogged over from across the street. Everything okay? I heard shouting from inside my house. The woman spun toward her. Perfect timing. Maybe you can help us explain the constant.

The family started cheering. The cast member looked at us with this apologetic face. I'm so sorry. We're completely sold out. My sister made this sound I've never heard from a human before. My mom got in the cast member's face. No, absolutely not. Check the back. There has to be more. The cast member kept apologizing and my sister started crying. The family in front of us was walking away with their kid holding the bucket above his head. My sister took off running and my mom went right after her. My sister tried to grab the bucket from the kid's hands. The dad pulled his son away and my sister was screaming, you don't even care about figment. You're just gonna throw that away in a week. My mom shoved the dad so hard he stumbled backwards. Then she lunged at the kid and grabbed the bucket. Kid started wailing. The other mom tried to grab it back and my mom yanked it away so hard the handle broke. My sister dropped to her knees sobbing, no, you broke it. Then she looked up at me with your hatred. This is all your fault. If you had run when I told you to, we would have been ahead of them. Disney security showed up and escorted us past hundreds of people who were recording and staring. My sister was crying so hard she could barely Walk and my mom was arguing with security the entire time. We got taken to some office where a supervisor explained that we were banned from all Disney properties. Mom tried to argue that my sister has a medical condition. My daughter needs this popcorn bucket for her mental health. My dad was sitting in the corner with his head in his hands. My sister was on her phone looking up resale prices for the bucket and crying harder every time she refreshed. The supervisor said we needed to leave immediately and that if we tried to come back, we'd be arrested for trespassing. They walked us out through a back exit. We had dinner reservations that night that cost $400 and we missed it because we spent three hours getting banned from Disney World. We drove back to the hotel in complete silence except for my sister sobbing in the back seat. My mom kept saying that family is going to sell that bucket for hundreds of dollars. That's why they wanted it so badly. I checked my phone and my sister had posted a five paragraph rant about Disney discriminating against adults and how I ruined her life by not caring about her passion. My mom had already commented, so proud of you for standing up for yourself, baby girl.

She finally looked at me and her expression was cold. So you never actually dated him? It's not like you have dibs. She stepped closer. Besides, I like him, too. And unlike you, I can actually get him without patting. I couldn't believe it. The bullying started immediately. Boys would throw balled up tissues at my chest in class. Need more stuffing, they'd ask. Girls would corner me in the bathroom, demanding I prove I was real. Teachers saw it happening but did nothing because it was just kids being kids. One boy tried to grab my chest to check for tissues until I slapped him when I watched it all while holding Oscar's hand in the hallway. She'd post Bible verses about kindness on Sunday, then laugh when someone threw tissues at me on Monday. Three weeks of living hell while she lived her perfect double life. Now it's Wednesday, Bible study night, when I just texted her parents that we're studying together, then headed to Oscar's house. I'm sitting in my room now staring at my phone. Rani's mom's number is right there in my contacts. After three weeks of hell, I'm done covering for her. Pick up the phone and dial her. Mom answered on the second ring. Hi, sweetie. How's Bible study going? Actually, I wanted to tell you a joke. I said calmly, Ronnie is not here. She's at Oscar Miller's house. Just kidding. Well, actually, not kidding. The line went dead. 20 Minutes later, my phone exploded with text from everyone at Oscar's house. Apparently, he hosted a party. Ronai's parents had burst in, her mom in house slippers, her dad still in his pastoral collar. They found Ronai and Oscar on his couch, her shirt unbuttoned, his hands under her bra, the same bra she'd mocked me for wearing. Her mom dragged Ronai out by her arm while she sobbed and begged. Her dad was shouting about deception and sin in front of everyone. Thirty teenagers watched the pastor's perfect daughter get hauled out half dressed. By morning, Renee's parents had pulled her from school, homeschool only, no phone, no car, no friends until she turned 18. Church members whispered about the scandal. Oscar dumped her immediately, saying he didn't want the drama. Renee still hasn't left her house in three weeks. Her parents installed cameras on every door. Someone saw her once watching from her bedroom window.

My sister has been obsessed with Disney since we were kids, but it got really bad after college. She's 24 now and has an annual pass even though we live in Ohio, which means my parents fund her monthly trips to Florida. Her room looks like a Disney store exploded in it. She has hundreds of collector pins covering every surface and a shrine to figment the Dragon in the corner. She even tracks limited edition merchandise on a spreadsheet. My parents pay for everything because she claimed she was building a business selling Disney content, but her Instagram only had 200 followers. I wanted nothing to do with this weird Disney worship, but my mom somehow guilt tripped me into going on a family trip with them. The trip was a nightmare from day one. My sister had a full itinerary planned down to the minute, including which bathrooms we were allowed to use. She cried twice before lunch on the first day because the character meet and greet line was too long. My parents just kept apologizing to her and buying her stuff to calm her down. By day three, I was looking at flights home. That's when my sister burst into my room at 6:00am. The segment bucket drops tomorrow, she said like she was announcing someone died. She made us sit through a 45 minute Presentation about how we were going to obtain the bucket. My mom was taking notes and my dad asked if we needed walkie talkies. When I said it's just a popcorn bucket, my sister's face went red. You don't get me. You never have. My mom squeezed my arm. Please just support her. The next morning, we got to Eckhart two hours before it opened. When the gates opened, everyone started power walking toward the store. My sister was practically running and my parents were right behind her. I was walking at a normal pace because I don't run for anyone. When we got in line at the store, it was already wrapped around the building. My sister was on her phone refreshing five different Disney Facebook groups and doing breathing exercises. My mom was next to her saying, you're doing so good, baby. We're almost there. When we finally got close to the front, a cast member came out and started counting heads. She pointed at the family.

So I told a joke, too. She hasn't left her house in three weeks. When I and I had been best friends since 6th grade, she was the pastor's daughter who knew exactly how to smile at adults while breaking every rule behind their backs. I was the girl who apologized when people hurt me, who said it's fine when it wasn't, who never fought back when I loved that about me. She'd share her darkest secrets knowing I'd never tell. She'd push boundaries knowing I'd never push back. She knew I was safe. That no matter what she did, I take it that's why she felt so comfortable making her little joke. For context, I've had a crush on Oscar since second grade. We rode the bus together from kindergarten through eighth grade. He was the boy who shared his fruit snacks with me and who let me borrow his jacket when it rained. I loved him since I was 7 years old. Everyone knew it. My mom, his mom, and especially Renee. She used to tease me about writing Missus Oscar in my notebooks. When Oscar's family moved across town freshman year, I was devastated. When he came back junior year, I thought it was fate. Renee knew exactly how I felt. When Oscar showed up at youth group that first Wednesday, I'd spent an hour telling her about how He smiled at me in the hallway how maybe this was our chance. But Renee had her own secret. She'd been sneaking around with different boys for over a year and I was always her cover story. Her parents were the strictest in our church. No dating until 18, no being alone with boys, no secular music. Every Wednesday. For two years, I've been her Bible study partner while she went on dates. First it was Logan from math class, then Kendall from youth group, then some college guy she met at Starbucks. I covered for her 47 times. I did it because she was my best friend and that's what friends do. Three weeks ago at Oscar's teammates party, I finally worked up the courage to talk to Oscar alone. When I was in the bathroom and I made some stupid joke about our old bus driver, Oscar actually laughed, not the polite kind. For 30 seconds, it felt like we were kids again. When I came back and saw us laughing together, her face changed. That's when she announced to everyone, at least I don't need push up bras to get his attention. Like someone we all know. She looked right at me, right? Remember when you bought three different colors? Hoping he'd notice. Oscar laughed the hardest. I pulled her outside immediately. What the hell was that about? My hands were shaking when I shrugged, examining her nails. Relax. It was just a joke. You know how I feel

I whispered, panicking, hardly able to form words. Abner, no! But then something unexpected happened. The lead officer froze, eyes wide and a strange grin spread across his face. He bent slightly toward Abner. You know how to talk, don't you, sweet boy? Abner squawked, almost as if responding, tilting his head one by one. The other officer's expression softened. Then laughter burst from them, loud, uncontrollable, and completely unexpected. Squawk! Squawk! You know how to talk, the lead officer mimicked, waving a hand at Abner, who responded with another squeaky, proud squawk. My shoulders relaxed slightly, though my heart was still pounding in disbelief. I laughed too, a nervous, relieved laugh that quickly turned to genuine. Abner hopped up and down lightly on my shoulder, pecking his feathers as thoroughly enjoying the attention. The tension that had once overcome the park moments ago seemed to disappear completely. You're off the hook this time, miss, the lead officer finally said, shaking his head but still laughing. But you better take that thing to a vet. Rabies shot, check out the works. We've never seen a crow like this. Are you sure? I asked, my voice trembling despite the relief running through me. Yes, but keep him away from me next time, another officer added, still Laughing under his breath, I exhaled. Abner ruffled his feathers happily. Letting out one last squawk. I stroked his head, whispering, see, I told you we'd be okay. The park returned to its usual hum children laughing, joggers passing, birds chirping. But for me, nothing felt ordinary. Abner wasn't just a pet. He was a protector, a companion, and somehow a hero. That day, a simple walk in the park had turned into an adventure I would never forget. And as the officers drove away, still chuckling at the sight of a crow talking back to them, I realized just how lucky I was, not only to have Abner, but to have him by my side when the world seemed ready to take him away.

I'm standing there holding my bag like, dude, So I tell him it's none of your business and you need to be polite. He straight up says, I am not polite. At this point, I'm done. I tell him to behave himself and just stare at him. No smile, no backing down, nothing. He doesn't say anything else after that, just stands there looking stupid. His wife is watching this whole thing happen from across the aisle. She doesn't say a word, just stares. The kid looks confused. Then some guy a few rows back offers to swap with dad so they can sit together. Great, problem solved. I sit down in my window seat, put my headphones on and that's it. But here's the thing. They acted like I was the villain for not giving up something I paid for. They tried to guilt trip me by sticking their kid in my seat before I even got there, hoping I'd just go along with it. That's manipulative. If sitting together was so important, book your seats in advance like everyone else. Don't show up expecting strangers to fix your problem and then act like they're terrible people when they say, no, I didn't ask why they needed To sit together. I didn't care. Maybe the kid gets scared flying. Maybe the dad's controlling. Maybe they just didn't feel like paying extra to pick seats. None of that is my problem. The dad tried to shame me in front of a plane full of people. And when that didn't work, he got passive aggressive and his wife just sat there watching him act like a child. The irony.

They have 150 guests. Then they better start making calls. My phone started buzzing within minutes. I let it go to voicemail five times before finally picking up on mom's sixth call. Malcolm, she was screaming. Actually screaming. What did you do? I own every single vendor you hired. Every single one. You've been paying my companies this entire time? But. But we paid deposits. Almost $100,000 in deposits you're getting back. Minus my 75 grand. Use it to find new vendors. Good luck booking anything decent with 3 weeks notice. Mom was crying now, Malcolm, please. Harper's been talking about this for months. She didn't do anything wrong. Did Harper know you uninvited me? She. Malcolm, that doesn't matter. Did she? No. More silence. Then quietly, she said the photos would look better with just her. Then she can have her party on a park bench for all I care. Malcolm. Dad again? Desperate now? Your sister's friends, our friends. Everyone will. Everyone will what? Find out you can't actually afford the lifestyle you've been fronting? That your son you've been trash talking for 20 years actually owns half this city? Where are your parents? No, your Harvard parents. You made that clear. When I was seven, I could hear mom sobbing in the background, dad breathing hard like he'd been running. What do you want? Dad finally asked. Money and apology. I thought about every birthday party, every graduation, every Celebration. I've Been pushed out of because I didn't fit their image. I want you to tell Harper the truth. All of it. Who paid for her party, who owns the vendors, and who you really are. and I want you both to admit something you've never been able to say. What? That I'm your only successful child. Say it to me, to Harper, to your country club friends. Tell them I'm the only one of your children who doesn't live off daddy's money. The silence was deafening. We can't. Then enjoy explaining to 150 guests why there's no party. Wait. Dad's voice cracked. I smirked. Come to my office tomorrow, 9:00am. Your office? Excellence Events headquarters. The building you pass everyday downtown. The next morning, they walked into my conference room. Harper was with him, her face swollen from crying. Say it, I said. No greeting, no small talk. Dad looked at the floor. You're successful. To my face. He raised his eyes. You're successful. Did you hear that? She nodded. Now the rest. Mom spoke up, her voice cracking. You're more successful than Harper. And you're our only successful child. Good. Now you can explain that to your 150 guests with no venue. But you said. I lied. Just like you did for 20 years. Mom reached into her purse and pulled out something I never expected to see. Full story on channel link below.

She pointed at the family in front of us and said, you guys will get the last one. The family started cheering. The cast member looked at us with this apologetic face. I'm so sorry. We're completely sold out. My sister made this sound I've never heard from a human before. My mom got in. The cast members face, no, absolutely not. Check the back. There has to be more. The cast member kept apologizing and my sister started crying. The family in front of us was walking away with their kid holding the bucket above his head. My sister took off running and my mom went right after her. My sister tried to grab the bucket from the kid's hands. The dad pulled his son away and my sister was screaming, you don't even care about figment. You're just gonna throw that away in a week. My mom shoved the dad so hard he stumbled backwards. Then she lunged at the kid and grabbed the bucket. Kids started wailing. The other mom tried to grab it back and my mom yanked it away so hard the handle broke. My sister dropped to her knees sobbing, no, you broke it. Then she looked up at me with pure hatred. This is all your fault. If you had run when I told you to, we would have been ahead of them. Disney security showed up and escorted us past hundreds of people who were recording and Staring. My sister was crying so hard she could barely walk. And my mom was arguing with security the entire time. We got taken to some office where a supervisor explained that we were banned from all Disney properties. Mom tried to argue that my sister has a medical condition. My daughter needs this popcorn bucket for her mental health. My dad was sitting in the corner with his head in his hands. My sister was on her phone looking up resale prices for the bucket and crying harder every time she refreshed. The supervisor said we needed to leave immediately and that if we tried to come back, we'd be arrested for trespassing. They walked us out through a back exit. We had dinner reservations that night that cost $400 and we missed it because we spent three hours getting banned from Disney World. We drove back to the hotel in complete silence except for my sister sobbing in the back seat. My mom kept saying that family is going to sell that bucket for hundreds of dollars. That's why they wanted it so badly. I checked my phone and my sister had posted a five paragraph ran about Disney discriminating against adults and how I ruined her life by not caring about her passion. My mom had already commented, so proud of you for standing up for yourself, baby girl.

The animal control truckled up as soon as the team saw me. I was taking my crow for a walk in the park, and he was sitting on my shoulder, relaxing, his feathers catching sunlight. I was shaking so hard. No license, no paperwork. Just me and him. My heart pounded so hard I thought it might give me away before I could even open my mouth. May I help you, miss? One of the officers leaned out the window, his eyes moving between me and Abner. Do you. Do you have a license for him? The officer went on, frowning as his partner stepped a bit closer. No, I whispered, hugging Abner tighter. But he's harmless. Really smart. The officer's eyes thinned. Miss, you need a license for that animal. Wild pets can be dangerous. You can't just walk around with him in public. My stomach dropped. He's fine, I said, trying to keep my voice steady. He's trained. You won't. Sorry, miss, but we have to take him in for an examination to make sure he doesn't carry any diseases. My chest went tight, and for a second I froze. But there was no way I was letting them take Abner without a fight. The lead officer's face went white. Hand him over now. Or else what? I snapped, my voice shaking. You'll be taken in for questioning. Either way, he comes with us. Never! I yelled, running down the park pathway. My feet barely touched the pavement as I ran as fast as I could, passing by joggers and picnickers who were just staring at us. Behind me I could hear the officer shouting, catching up with me. My mind raced. What could I possibly say to keep Abner miss? The officer shouted again. Closer! This time! My lungs burned. I suddenly stopped, holding Abner tight to my chest. I swear, officer, I really do have a license for him! I cried. Abner's been my pet for years. He's my emotional support animal. Please, please don't take him away! Abner flapped his wings and let out a series of sharp swawks. His claws tapped my shoulder as if asking me to hold still. Then, without warning, he moved forward, pecking at the closest officer's uniform. It was mass chaos. Arms waved, shouts echoed across the park. People near

So I made them admit I was their only successful child. I was adjusting my durag before bed when my parents called. Don't take this the wrong way, but we think it's better if you don't come to your sister's gacha day. The club just started allowing mixed families. We're not pushing it by bringing both of you. You see, Harper was my adopted sister. White skin, blonde hair that didn't move, perfect blue eyes. And I was their mixed race son with black skin that couldn't be bleached. I thought if I funded her day, they'd see me differently. Dad jumped in. Look, we already allocated your contribution to other expenses. Anyway, the $75,000 you sent is being put to good use. They didn't know that the venue, caterers and florists all had one thing in common. Me as their boss. So you're keeping my money but not inviting me? It's Harper's day, mom said simply. You understand? I go and mustard out a yes before hanging up. That's when I decided my family was about to learn what happens when you bite the hand that feeds you. I thought back to my childhood. Mine and Harper's birthdays fall on the same month, two weeks apart. Harper's parties cost five grand with a bounce house and catered food. Mine was a grocery store cake mom forgot to pick up until six PM because of budget issues. By the time Harper hit high school, I was basically invisible unless I did something wrong. Like when she threw my Xbox down the stairs during an argument. My parents told me, it's just a game, Malcolm. Grow up. But when I accidentally scratched her bike, grounded, and had to pay for repairs out of my allowance. An hour after they hung up on me, my phone rang. It was Celia, the event coordinator of my company. Mister Malcolm, your family just called about your sister's Celebration. What now? They want to ensure all food is appropriate for their real guests, not urban preferences. They were very specific about menu changes. Celia, can we still cancel their entire booking? Cancel? Sir, their event is in 3 weeks. What exactly have they booked with us? The Skyline Ballroom, Golden Catering, Divine Flowers, our transport fleet, photographers. Sir, they've booked nearly $200,000 in services. I laughed. I couldn't help it. My parents had hired my entire company while trying to keep me out. Cancel everything. Silence then, sir, cancel it all. Venue, food, flowers, everything. Send them a notice that their event has been terminated due to violation of our inclusion policy.

My sister has been obsessed with Disney since we were kids, but it got really bad after college. She's 24 now and has an annual pass even though we live in Ohio, which means my parents fund her monthly trips to Florida. Her room looked like a Disney store exploded in it. She has hundreds of collector pins covering every surface and a shrine to pigment the dragon in the corner. She even tracks limited edition merchandise on a spreadsheet. My parents pay for everything because she claimed she was building a business selling Disney content, but her Instagram only had 200 followers. I wanted nothing to do with this weird Disney worship, but my mom somehow guilt tripped me and to going on a family trip with them. The trip was a nightmare from day one. My sister had a full itinerary planned down to the minute, including which bathrooms we were allowed to use. She cried twice before lunch on the first day because a character meet and greet line was too long. My parents just kept apologizing to her and buying her stuff to calm her down. By day three, I was looking at flights home. That's when my sister burst into my room at 6:00am. The segment bucket drops tomorrow, she said like she was announcing someone died. She made us sit through a 45 Minute presentation about how we were going to obtain the bucket. My mom was taking notes and my dad asked if we needed walkie talkies. When I said it's just a popcorn bucket, my sister's face went red. You don't get me. You never have. My mom squeezed my arm. Please just support her. The next morning, we got to Epcot two hours before it opened. When the gates opened, everyone started power walking toward the store. My sister was practically running and my parents were right behind her. I was walking at a normal pace because as I don't run for anyone. When we got in line at the store, it was already wrapped around the building. My sister was on her phone refreshing five different Disney Facebook groups and doing breathing exercises. My mom was next to her saying, you're doing so good, baby. We're almost there. When we finally got close to the front, a cast member came out.

So I made sure they turned into laughing stocks. The day I met Brian's mother, Rita, she looked me up and down and said I seem nice for a temporary girlfriend. That should have been my warning. Brian and I met at a veterinary conference in Denver. He was presenting on equine surgery. I was there for my small animal practice. We bonded over terrible conference coffee and our shared obsession with emergency medicine. Six months later, he proposed at the same conference, right where we'd first met. His family's reaction was immediate and vicious. Rita called Brian crying, saying he was throwing his life away. His father Richard, sent a formal email listing all the women from their country club who would have been better choices. His sister Sophia started a group chat with the extended family called Brian's Mistake, where they shared articles about divorce rates. I didn't know Brian had seen it when he borrowed Sophia's phone. For two years, I tried everything. I brought Rita her favorite flowers on every visit. I helped Richard with his classic car restoration research. I attended Sophia's Boring Charity luncheons for her friends whispered about me being a gold digger even though I made more money than Brian. Nothing worked. They wanted their son to marry Victoria, the daughter of their best friends, who'd been waiting for Brian to notice her. Since high school. Victoria, who still called him twice a week. Victoria, whose parents owned half the commercial real estate in town. I stopped trying after Rita's Thanksgiving incident. She'd invited Victoria to dinner without telling us, seated her next to Brian, and spent the entire meal talking about their shared memories while I sat there like furniture. Brian finally told them that if they couldn't respect me, they wouldn't be part of our lives. They backed off, but only superficially. The wedding planning revealed their true strategy. Rita insisted on being involved, then criticized every choice. The venue was too rustic, the flowers were too simple, the caterer wasn't prestigious enough. She offered to pay for upgrades, but only if she could make the decisions. Declined, and paid for everything ourselves. Three days before the wedding, Sophia called Brian, panicking. She'd seen our cousin posting about her dress and realized she bought the same one I described as similar to mine. Could she still

She agreed, sounded apologetic even. The morning of our wedding, I was getting ready with my bridesmaids when the photographer knocked. He needed to discuss something urgent. Brian's family had arrived for pre ceremony photos and there was a situation. Every single one of them was wearing white. Rita was in a white beaded gown that looked like a mother of the bride dress because it was one. Richard is in a white suit. Sophia is in a white cocktail dress. Brian's grandmother, aunts, uncles and cousins all in white. 23 people dressed like they were attending their own weddings. The photographer didn't know what to do. My maid of honor, Julia started cursing. My mother went silent, which was worse than yelling. I asked the photographer to give us a moment and sat down. To think they wanted to ruin my wedding. They wanted the photos to look ridiculous. Everyone to talk about how his family upstaged me for the day to be about their protest instead of our marriage. But then I remembered something. Julia's sister managed a Halloween store that stayed open year round for theater productions. It was 40 minutes away. I called her. Did she have costume accessories in bulk? Specifically, did she have those cheap promotional t shirts from last Halloween's zombie run, the bright red ones with fake blood spatters that said survivor in huge letters? She had boxes of them. Julia and two bridesmaids. Drove there while I continued getting ready. They came back with 30 shirts and a bag of accessories. I had the wedding coordinator call a quick meeting with Brian's family in the garden, away from other guests. I walked out in my wedding dress carrying the box of shirts. Rita started to speak, probably to make some excuse, but I cut her off. You have two choices, I said. Put these on over your clothes right now or leave. The ceremony starts in 20 minutes. Sophia laughed, said I was being ridiculous, that I couldn't force them to ruin their outfits. Richard said I had no right to make demands. Rita called me a controlling bitch who'd finally shown my true colours. That's when Brian appeared. He'd been waiting inside, letting me handle it my way. First. He looked at his family, all dressed in white, and said five words, put them on or go. Their jaws dropped. Full story on channel link below.

You're anti gay and you're proving it right now. My husband's fork clattered onto his plate. Stop. The whole room went silent. I'd never heard him use that tone before. Even I jumped. Our daughter's mouth snapped shut, but her eyes were still blazing with anger. Sit down, my husband said quietly, and listen to me. She sat, arms crossed, glaring at him. You wanna talk about privilege, he said, pulling out his phone. Let me show you something I don't want to, she started. No, you're going to watch this and you're going to think about what real homophobia looks like. He pulled up a video. The first one showed gay people in the Middle East talking about living and hiding, about the constant fear. Then another from Eastern Europe where a pride parade got attacked. Then footage I couldn't even watch all the way through showing what happens to LGBTQ people in countries where it's illegal. Our daughter's face changed. The anger drained away, replaced by something else for maybe or shame. That's real homophobia, my husband said. That's what actual discrimination looks like. You live in a country where you can dye your hair rainbow and wear ride shirts and call your parents bigots over dinner. Do you understand how incredibly lucky you are? Dad, I am not finished. His voice was shaking now. We love you. We have loved you since the day you were born and we will Love you until the day we die. We have spent months learning how to support you better. We read books. We went to groups. We changed the way we talk and think because we want you to feel safe and loved. Tears were rolling down his cheeks now. But you don't get to weaponize your sexuality. You don't get to scream homophobia every time someone disagrees with you. There are gay kids your age who are being thrown out of their homes, beaten, killed, and you're calling us bigots be cause we won't dye our hair. Our daughter was crying now, too. I just wanted you to show that you care. We do care, I said. But showing we care doesn't mean doing everything you demand. That's not how love works. She, he stood up from the table without another word and went upstairs. We heard her door closed. That was 3 hours ago. The house has been completely silent since then. I can see light under her door, but she hasn't come out. My husband is sitting on the couch staring at nothing. I think we both feel like we failed somehow. Even though I know what he said needed to be said, I just don't know what happens next.

So I gave her a tough reality check. She came out at 15, and we were nothing but supportive. My husband cried happy tears, told her we loved her no matter what. I immediately ordered books on supporting LGBTQ teens. We researched everything, joined parent support group, Learned the terminology. We thought we were doing everything right. But over the past few months, something shifted. Every single conversation became about her sexuality. Every disagreement became ammunition. I asked her to clean her room. You're only saying that because as I'm gay. My husband said she couldn't go to a party. This is homophobia. At first, we thought maybe this was normal, part of her finding her identity. The support group said to be patient, but kept escalating. She started policing our language, our friends, even what we watched on TV. If we didn't immediately agree with every opinion she had, suddenly we were anti gay. The worst part? We couldn't even talk about it. Anytime we tried to have a conversation, she'd shut down or start crying about how we didn't support her. My husband and I felt like we were walking on eggshells in our own house. Last night, everything came to a head. We were having dinner, just normal Wednesday night pasta, when she brought up Pride Month. She dyed her hair rainbow the week before, and honestly, it looked great. We told her That we'd already promised to go to the raid with her in a few weeks, but apparently that wasn't enough. I think it's disgusting when straight people don't show visible support during pride, she said, twirling her pasta. It's basically the same as racism. If you're not actively showing you're an ally, you're part of the problem. My husband and I exchanged a look. Here we go again. Honey, we are allies, I said carefully. We support you completely. Then prove it, she said. I want all of us to dye our hair for Pride Month. Any rainbow color. It doesn't matter which one. I tried to stay calm. Sweetheart, we're not going to do that. We support, but we don't need to dye our hair to prove it. Her face went red. Are you serious right now? This is exactly what I'm talking about. You say you support me, but when it comes to actually doing something, you won't. Dying our hair isn't. I started. You're homophobic! She yelled. Both of you! You don't actually support me, you just pretend to.

Mitchell nodded like this was all perfectly legal. Smart move, Wesley. She's had a free ride long enough. I looked at the paper and almost laughed. He downloaded some random eviction template and just wrote my name on it in pen. Melanie finally spoke up, her voice barely a whisper. Maybe we can give her the weekend at least. Wesley shot her a look that made her shut up immediately. Nah, baby. We discussed this. She, it was tonight. That's when I made the call. Hey, Mister Sanders, I said, putting him on speaker. Could you come up to 2C? We have a situation here. Wesley's chest puffed out. Good. Call the landlord. I'm taking over this lease anyway. Melanie and I are common law now. Five minutes later, Mister Sanders walked in with his master keys jingling. He was this 60 year old Brooklyn native who'd owned the building for 30 years. He took one look at the scene. Wesley with his bags, Mitchell trying to look intimidating, Melanie shrinking into the. Ouch. And me standing there calm as could be. What's going on here, Mr Sanders asked, though his slight smirk told me he already knew. Wesley stepped forward with all the confidence of someone who'd watched too many law shows. I'm moving in and she's moving out. I've been living here for three months, which makes me a tenant. Melanie and I are together, so I'm taking over her half of the Lease. Mr Sanders looked at Wesley like he'd just said the earth was flat. Then he started laughing. Not a chuckle, but a full belly laugh that went on for a solid 30 seconds. Wesley's face started twitching. What's so funny, old man? Mr Sanders wiped his eyes and pulled out his phone. Let me show you something, son. He pulled up a document. This is the lease for apartment 2C. See that single name? That's not Melanie. That's not.

Logan had been complaining for weeks that I hovered too much. When we went out at his company's holiday party, he pulled me aside near the coat check. Listen. Tonight, can you just not be so attached to me? My coworkers think it's weird how you're always by my side. Just mingle on your own. For once, I smiled sweetly. Of course, babe, I'll give you tons of space. Really? You're not upset? Not at all. You want independence at parties? You got it. The party was at this upscale rooftop venue, open bar, DJ, the Works. Logan immediately ditched me to bro out with his work buddies, leaving me by the entrance. Perfect. I walked straight to the bar where his boss, Thomas, was getting drinks. Emily, where's Logan? Oh, he wanted space. Tonight, I'm flying solo. Thomas looked confused at his own company party. He says I'm too clingy, didn't want me cramping his style. Thomas's wife, Diane overheard. He left you alone. How rude. No worries. I'll just entertain myself. And I did. I ended up in a fascinating conversation with the CFO about cryptocurrency. Then the head of HR pulled me into their group to settle a debate about true crime podcasts. I was having a genuinely great time. An hour in, I caught Logan's eye across the room. He was with his bros but kept glancing over As I laughed with his supervisors, then the DJ started playing salsa music. This gorgeous guy from Accounting, Javier, asked if I could dance. I'd love to. We tore up that dance floor. Turns out Javier was a semi professional dancer. He spun me, dipped me the whole nine yards. A crowd formed to watch. Logan appeared suddenly. Hey, maybe we should, oh, am I being too clingy? I asked mid spin. No, I just, great. Then you won't mind if I keep dancing. Javier dipped me dramatically. Crowd cheered. Logan retreated to the bar Downing whiskey with his confused buddies. Later, the CEO's wife pulled me aside. You're Logan's girlfriend. We need to talk. She dragged me to her table full of executives wives. They immediately adopted me, pouring champagne and gossiping about everyone. Logan usually brags about you non stop. One said, where is he? He needed guy time. Apparently I hover. They exchanged looks. Men are idiots, the CEO's wife declared, raising her glass. Toasted to that. Logan kept trying to approach, but every time he got close, someone else would pull me into conversation. His female co workers wanted workout tips. The it guys needed restaurant recommendations. Even the janitor asked for relationship advice. Everyone loved me except Logan who looked increasingly miserable. Then came the speeches. CEO grabbed the mic thanking everyone for their hard work. Special shout out to Emily for bringing such amazing energy tonight. Logan, you're a lucky man. Everyone clapped looking Around for Logan. He was sulking by the bathroom. Where's Logan? The CEO asked into the mic. He wanted space, someone yelled. Laughter erupted. The CEO's wife grabbed the mic. Well, his loss. Emily's been the life of the party. More cheering. Logan's face went red. Around midnight, the party was winding down. I was ex.

Dude, what the hell? I flashed him my lock screen. I have a girlfriend. His face went white. Just trying to help you move forward, man. Move forward. From what? He practically ran away. I tried calling my girlfriend Isabella on the public landline right then straight to voicemail. I must have called 15 times. I was losing my mind. Everyone felt so bad for me that no one even forced me back on the field to play. As soon as lunch hit, I grabbed Jason more aggressively this time. Tell me what's happening now. Now I can't. He was typing frantically in his notes app. You can't or you won't. His girlfriend Ava read over his shoulder, then slapped him hard. How could you not tell him? You coward. She stormed off. Jason, something happened to Isabella. He wouldn't look at me. Just kept typing. That's when Stacy walked by. She saw me and her face twisted with rage. You never deserved a girl like Usabella. I always told her she deserved better. Her friend clamped a hand over her mouth and dragged her away. My head was spinning. I stumbled to the vending machines where the coaches were arguing. He has a right to know now, Mrs. Griffin. Hissed, there's no point. The decision has already been made. Mrs. Fitzharris shot back, somebody tell me what's happening, I shouted. They scattered like roaches. It wasn't until the bus ride back that Jason spoke to me again. By that point, I was so sick of everyone's BS.

Every Sunday for 15 years, my grandmother made the same announcement at family dinner. When I pass away, everything goes to whoever visits me most. She tap her cane on the floor, smile like she just revealed state secrets. This turned my entire extended family into vultures. My Aunt Rachel drove three hours every Tuesday just to vacuum Grandma's living room. Uncle Steve called twice daily asking about her arthritis. My cousin Jennifer moved back from California and started doing Grandma's grocery shopping. They all hated each other, but pretended to be saints around her. Meanwhile, I was banned from inheritance discussion. I liked guys and chicken nuggets, and grandma made it crystal clear that sinners don't deserve family money. She'd change the subject whenever I entered rooms. My cousins would smirk and whisper about how I'd be working at McDonald's while they lived in luxury. But here's what none of them knew. I actually loved spending time with grandma. Not for money, she'd already told me I wasn't getting any, but because she was genuinely funny. When she wasn't performing for the Inheritance Hunters while they argued over who deserved what, I'd sneak over on Wednesday nights to watch old movies and eat ice cream. Grandma would relax completely when it was just us. She'd tell dinosaurs jokes from the 2000 BC and complain about how fake everyone was being. She even started asking about My boyfriend and seemed genuinely interested in our relationship. I never mentioned these visits to anyone because I knew they'd think I was scheme. After she passed last year, the whole family gathered for the will reading. Rachel brought a calculator. Steve wore his funeral suit from 1995. Jennifer had already started planning her European vacation. They were practically drooling as the lawyer opened the envelope.

The one who'd impersonate teachers perfectly or release three chickens numbered 1, 2 and 4 into the hallways, leaving staff searching for non existent chicken No. 3 for hours. His pranks were creative but never truly harmful until graduation day. For weeks, he'd been mysteriously absent. During lunch periods, we noticed him hanging around the auditorium where graduation would be held, but assumed he was just helping set up like other student during the ceremony. Everything seemed normal until our principal approached the podium to deliver his traditional speech. When you press the microphone button instead of turning on, the entire electrical system shut down. In the confusion that followed, the giant projection screen behind the stage suddenly lit up, apparently connected to some separate power source. What appeared was a compilation video of secretly recorded faculty meetings where teachers made sarcastic comments about students, gust grade, manipulations for athletes and our principal referred to our class as the worst batch in years. The footage was devastating. Miss Wilson mocking a student's learning disability. Coach Brenner admitting to changing grade. It's Doctor Harrison calling parents entitled whiners. Parents gasped. Students looked stunned. The teachers on stage froze in horror. Within seconds, parents began shouting. Several students in the audience burst into tears seeing their teachers true opinions of them. The superintendent tried desperately to shut down the Projection. But Marcus.

Tim will handle tonight's demonstration, she announced with fake authority dripping from every word. You're needed in the children's touch tank area for deep cleaning duties. Everyone in that equipment room knew exactly what would happen if Tim approached Poseidon during feeding time, when the octopus was most territorial and aggressive, but I looked Caroline directly in the eyes and explained the obvious anyway. Poseidon won't accept food from Tim, and he becomes violent when strangers approach during his dinner routine. Caroline snapped back that we managed without the feeding demonstration and gave me a direct order to report to the children's area immediately or face consequences. I slowly unclipped my security badge and identification card, placing both items on the stainless steel prep counter while our senior aquarist and two night staff members watched this confrontation unfold in stunned silence. I pulled out my phone to start recording and told Caroline that Poseidon was in full hunting mode because it was feeding time and Tim knew where all the equipment was stored. Caroline's face turned bright red when she realized I was documenting our conversation for legal purposes. If you walk out of this building, you're terminated immediately and permanently. I replied calmly that this was perfectly fine with me, already hearing Poseidon's agitated flashing echoing from the deep sea exhibit two rooms away. I'm recording this for unemployment documentation. Since you're firing me for refusing to endanger a four million dollar animal and potentially injure your completely inexperienced employee, I walked out of the building and barely made it to the parking lot before my phone started buzzing with frantic calls and text messages. Twelve missed calls came in during the first four minutes, starting with panicked messages from our senior aquarist describing how Poseidon had grabbed Tim's entire arm through the feeding slot and refused to let go.

I was 22, living my best life when my phone exploded with calls from my entire family. My cousin Eve, who was 16, told everyone I'd been sneaking into her room and that she was now pregnant with my baby. The whole family believed her instantly. My parents screamed at me over the phone, calling me disgusting. My siblings blocked me on everything. Even my grandparents who raised me wouldn't take my calls. I had zero proof it wasn't true. Eve was the family princess and I was just a black sheep cousin who barely came around anymore. The accusations spread like wildfire through our tight knit extended family. Aunts and uncles who used to invite me to barbecues suddenly acted like I didn't exist. Mom's sister, Eve's mother posted critical Facebook statuses about protecting our children from predators in our own family. Within a week, I was completely erased from every family group chat, every holiday plan, every graduation announcement. The next year destroyed me completely. I waited every day for police to show up at my door with handcuffs. Every knock made my heart stop. Every phone call from an unknown number sent me into a panic attack. I lost my job at the auto shop because I couldn't focus, kept making mistakes, showing up late, calling in sick. My boss finally sat me down and said, whatever was going on? At home, needed to stay there, but I was too broken to explain. Lost my apartment three months later when I couldn't make rent, moved in with a buddy who let me crash on his couch. But even he started asking weird questions when family never visited or called. Started drinking heavily just to sleep. Then drinking to get through the day. Then drinking because breathing felt impossible without it. Dating became a nightmare. How do you explain why your entire family disowned you? First girl I tried to date asked to meet my parents. After 2 months, I made up some story about them being dead. Second girl saw through the lies when she noticed I I had zero family photos, no childhood stories, no one to invite to anything. She asked Point Blank why I never talked about my family. And when I couldn't give a straight answer, he was gone by morning. The isolation was crushing. Holidays were the worst. Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter. Everyone else had somewhere to go, someone to call. I'd drive past my old neighborhood and see all the cars in my parents driveway knowing they were all inside without me. I finally moved three states away and started completely over. New job, new friends, new identity. Told everyone I met that my family lived far away and we weren't close. Simple, clean lie that people accepted. Got into therapy, got sober, worked my ass off to build something resembling a normal life.

So I did exactly that and watched her world crumble. She watched me get down on one knee five times and said no every single time. Eight years together, I've been playing husband since year 2, paying her car note, keeping her on my insurance, covering most of the rent while she found herself through three different careers. She had this whole routine down, tears in her eyes, hand on her heart, then some perfectly rehearsed excuse, we're not ready. Let's wait till we're more stable. The timing isn't right. Then came proposal No. 5, and she finally showed me who she really was. I'd gone all out this time, convinced myself maybe the problem was I hadn't made it special enough. I rented out her favorite restaurants, rooftop, hung string lights everywhere and invited all our friends and family there. The whole production cost me three months salary, but I thought it'd be worth it when she finally said yes. My girlfriend stood there in the dress I'd bought her, surrounded by everyone we knew, and she didn't even let me finish the speech, just shook her head with this pitying smile like I was a dog that wouldn't stop bringing her the same stick. Back at our apartment that night, I finally broke, asked her straight up if she loved me. Why did she keep doing this? Her whole face changed in an instant and the mask came. Completely off. It's my choice when I accept a proposal, she said. Voice ice cold. You don't get to pressure me with your timeline. You're my boyfriend, so act like one. Stop trying to be my husband when I haven't even accepted your proposal. Know your place. Know my place. After eight years of building a life together, I was supposed to know my place. Those words rewired something in my brain. Eight years of playing husband while she kept me a boyfriend status because it was convenient for her. She wanted me to act like a boyfriend. Fine. I give her exactly what she asked for. But boyfriends don't pay their girlfriends bills. Boyfriends don't share bank accounts. Boyfriends don't sacrifice their futures for someone who won't even wear their ring. I started my new boyfriend only policy the next morning while she was at her yoga class. First, I sold the ring to a dealer for 12 grand, enough to cover what I spent on her car this year alone. Then I called Verizon and removed her from my phone plan. By the time she got home from yoga, I changed every password and moved my money from our joint account. She didn't even notice until lunch when her phone died mid phone call. Babe, my phone's not working, she texted from her laptop, annoyed but not worried. Call Verizon. It's being weird. An hour later, they said I'm not on the account anymore. Then the panic started. Creep. What did you do? I responded, I'm being your boyfriend and not your husband, just like you said. She actually laughed at first, thinking it was some kind of joke. She came home that night acting extra sweet. Made my favorite dinner and tried to cuddle on the couch. Okay, you made your point, she said. Kissing my neck. I'll think about what you said. Now fix my phone. I moved to the guest bedroom instead. The next morning, she couldn't log into Netflix. Then Hulu died.

I was the only night keeper at our aquarium who could handle Poseidon, our four million dollar giant Pacific octopus. And that evening he wrapped all eight arms around my forearm to gently pull crab from my beating tongues. His massive 200 pound body moved with surprising Grace through the crystal clear water of his tank. But when any other keeper approached, the same gentle creature became a destructive nightmare that sprayed black ink everywhere and destroyed thousands of dollars it's worth of equipment. Our new operations director Caroline watched from the observation deck with her arms crossed, clearly unimpressed by what she called my animal dependency problem during yesterday's staff meeting. She believed every creature should have multiple handlers because no single employee should be irreplaceable, especially not because of some oversized sea creature that cost more than most people's houses. Caroline had spent three weeks documenting every minor violation she could manage. Manufacturer writing me up for wearing a different brand of reef safe sunscreen than the one corporate required even though their brand gave me hives and docking my pay. When Poseidon's complex eating routine ran five minutes over my scheduled break, her masterpiece was hiring Tim, her former assistant manager who spent entire shifts taking Instagram selfies near the shark tank and had never worked with cephalopods in his 24 years of existence. Poseidon hated Tim with a burning intensity of a thousand suns shooting Pressurized water jets that soaked him completely whenever he approached the tank. And once Tim slipped so dramatically on the wet observation deck that he crashed through a three thousand dollar interactive display about octopus intelligence. Tim's solution was to stand 15 feet away from the tank and throw food pellets like he was feeding pigeons at the park, which made Poseidon retreat to his cave and refuse to eat for two entire days. A disaster struck on a Wednesday evening when major marine research donors were arriving for a private feeding demonstration at 8:30, specifically requesting to see our famous octopus interact with his primary caregiver 20 minutes before the V I. P. Tour.

All parents help their children, actually, came a small voice from the back row. Connor said his mom made him start over four times until it was perfect. Missus Prescott's face hardened. Elizabeth, mind your own business. I knelt beside Connor's desk. Connor, what book are you reading at home right now? His eyes darted to his mother, then back to me. The one about the wizard boy, he whispered. Harry Potter, I asked. He nodded slightly. What page are you on? 12, he mumbled. But mom reads me the hard parts. Missus Prescott's phone began ringing. She answered immediately, turning away from us. Yes, I'll be there. The meeting's running late. When she hung up, I stood my ground. Missus Prescott, I believe Connor needs reading support, not Advanced Placement. I'd like to recommend. Unacceptable, she snapped, gathering her things. I expect that plan implemented by tomorrow or I'll take this to the principal and the superintendent and the school board. As she stormed toward the door, she called back. Connor, don't forget you have piano at 4, then swimming at 5:30, then math tutoring at 7. After she left, the room remained silent until little Elizabeth spoke up. Connor, want to come to my birthday party Saturday? We're having a water balloon fight. Connor looked up, his eyes brightening slightly. My mom says I'm allergic to water balloons. That evening, I stayed late preparing a detailed assessment of Connor's actual reading level, along with Research based interventions. When Missus Prescott arrived for drop off the next morning, I handed her a folder. Here's my plan for Connor. I gave you my plan already, she said dismissively. Mine includes Connor's input, I replied, and documentation that will go to the school psychologist if you continue to push your son beyond his developmental capabilities. Her face paled. Are you threatening me? I'm advocating for Connor. That's my job. Six months later, Connor was reading at grade level and building his own science projects. Mrs. Prescott still Blairs at me during parent teacher conferences, but Connor smiles.

I was just three weeks into my first year teaching third grade when Missus Prescott marched into my classroom 15 minutes before dismissal. She wore a crisp business suit and carried a leather portfolio like it was a weapon. The children were finishing their science projects. Paper mache volcanoes that had taken us all week. Miss Wilson, she announced loudly, not caring that 27 8 year olds turned to stare. We need to discuss Connor's grades. I smiled professionally despite the interruption. I'd be happy to schedule a conference tomorrow. This is. Prescott didn't move now. It's fine. Connor needs to be moved to the advanced reading group immediately. Connor, a sweet boy who struggled to read at grade level, louched in his chair, cheeks burning red. Connor's making wonderful progress, I said quietly, but the advanced group might be frustrating for him right now. She pulled a document from her portfolio and slapped it on my desk. I've outlined a new education plan for Connor. You'll implement it starting tomorrow. It wasn't a request. The 10 page document detailed a complete curriculum rewrite for just her son. Demanded I give him different homework, different tests and 30 minutes of private tutoring daily during my lunch break. Missus Prescott, I can't give Connor a separate curriculum from the rest of the class. Her eyes narrowed. My husband and I donate significantly to this school. Perhaps you don't understand how Things work here. The classroom had gone silent. 27 pairs of eyes watched us, including Connor's, which were now filling with tears. Let's discuss this privately, I suggested. There's nothing to discuss. Sign this, acknowledging you've received Connor's new learning plan. I glanced at Connor, who was now hiding his face in his hands. Then I noticed something, his science project. Unlike the other volcanoes, Connor's was immaculate with perfect lettering and advanced features the other children hadn't attempted. Connor, did you make your volcano yourself? I asked gently. Before he could answer, missus Prescott cut in.

I was working at the steakhouse called the Cedar Room when this family started coming in every Friday night. The dad would snap his fingers at me like I was his personal servant, demanding water refills before I could even set down their menus. The mom constantly sent food back claiming it was too cold or too salty, obviously just fishing for discounts. Their son, Nathan, this 14 year old with the smuggest face you've ever seen, was the absolute worst. From the moment they walked in, Nathan acted like he owned the place. He'd make comments like, do you even know how to write down orders right? And don't mess up my steak like last time, even though I'd never served him before. The kid would deliberately throw bread crumbs on the floor while staring me down, then tell his parents, this guy looks like he couldn't afford a haircut. His parents would just laugh and nod along like he was some comedy genius. Every week I dreaded seeing them walk through that door. The hostess Sarah, would give me this apologetic look whenever she seated them in my section. Other servers started avoiding eye contact when the family showed up, grateful it wasn't their turn to deal with the nightmare table. One Friday evening in December, I was having an especially rough day. My car had broken down that morning and I was already stressed about The repair costs. When I saw Nathan's family walk in, my heart sank. They got seated in my section again. I brought out their usual order, trying to stay professional despite Nathan's constant snide remarks. I bet you can't even afford what's on this plate, he said with this evil smirk, pointing at his perfectly cooked rib eye steak. Before I could respond, he grabbed the edge of the plate and flipped it over, sending the hot steak and mashed potatoes directly onto my shoes. The gravy splattered all over my uniform. His parents burst out laughing like it was the funniest thing they'd ever seen.

My family discovered I was good with kids when I was 14 and babysat my cousin once. That single afternoon of watching cartoons turned me into their unpaid nanny for the next 12 years. At first, it was just by my sister dropping off her toddler just for an hour while she ran errands. That hour turned into six when she decided to get her nails done instead. I. I remember sitting on my floor surrounded by broken crayons and goldfish crackers, realizing I missed my shift at the coffee shop. My brother joined in with midnight text about his twins needing an emergency sitter for his concert plans. College, they took it even further. My sister would bang on my dorm door and dump her kids for entire weekends. She cost me my first serious boyfriend when she called me during our anniversary dinner screaming about a fake emergency. My boyfriend looked at me across that candlelit table and said he couldn't do this anymore. After graduation, my parents made everything worse by secretly giving my siblings keys to my apartment. I started coming home from my marketing job to find kids destroying my kitchen and toys taking over my home office. My boss pulled me aside after I'd missed another presentation and told me to figure out my priorities. The moment they took it too far came three months ago when I woke up to voices in my living room. I stumbled out of my pajamas to find four kids watching cartoons with suitcases next to them. My sister's two kids and my brother's twins were all there eating my cereal like it was just another Saturday. On my counter was a note that made my hand shake. My entire family had booked a month long cruise to Europe and decided not to tell me because I'd make it difficult, the note said. They knew I take good care of the kids like I always do. I kept reading it over and over trying to understand how they could just leave the country without even asking me. My sister had attached a grocery list and my brother left $200 for expenses. I was their personal hired help. They could book without notice. The youngest kid looked up and asked if I was making pancakes for breakfast. That innocent question broke something inside me because these kids had no idea their parents had just abandoned them. That's when I decided to teach them what abandonment really felt like. You see, 12 years of forced babysitting had taught me every rule about child welfare and what authorities look for. I made the kids breakfast and told them we were going to play a game where they told me about all the times they stayed with me before. I recorded videos on my phone as they excitedly shared stories about being dropped off for Days without their parents checking in. The seven year old even mentioned the time his mom left him here when he had strep throat. I carefully documented the suitcases, note and the pathetic $200 meant to last a month. Then I looked up the number for Child Protective Services. My family thought they were getting a free month in Europe. Instead, they were about to learn what happens when you abandon your children with someone who knows the system. I called CPS and reported four abandoned minors with no guardianship papers. The caseworker arrived within two hours and went pale reading the note. By afternoon, the kids were in emergency.

So I chose to forget I had a sister. For 2 years, I never called, never texted, never checked her Instagram or asked our parents how she was doing. When people brought her up, I would literally walk away. I told everyone, including our mom, I don't care if she's dying, I'm never talking to her again. My friends thought I was being dramatic. My parents kept begging me to reach out. But I had made a promise to myself and I was going to keep it no matter what. Then last Tuesday around midnight, someone Started pounding on my apartment door like the building was on fire. When I opened it, this dirty, sweating mess of a man pushed right past me into my living room. I recognized him instantly, Blake. He looked like he hadn't slept in days. His clothes were torn up. His hair was greasy, and he kept looking over his shoulder like someone was chasing him. That's when I noticed the kitchen knife tucked into his waistband. I need a place to hide, he said, pacing around my couch like a caged animal.

So I went to this Applebee's last Friday night around eight PM I get seated at this booth near the back and my waiter comes over. Guy looked like he was in his early 20s, kind of scrawny with this patchy beard. He takes my drink order, just a Coke, and disappears. For like 15 minutes I'm sitting there looking around, watching other tables get their food and I'm still waiting for my damn soda. Finally, he shows up with my Coke, doesn't even apologize, just flops it down and asks what I want to eat. I order the chicken tenders with honey mustard and seasoned fries. Pretty basic stuff. He writes it down and vanishes again. 20 minutes go by, nothing. I can see him at the computer terminal just standing there scrolling on his phone. Other waiters are running around actually doing their jobs, but this guy is just chilling. I try to get his attention a couple times, but he's completely ignoring my section. After another 10 minutes, I flag down a different waitress, older lady with gray hair who looked like she actually cared about her job. I asked her if she knows what happened to my food order. She looks confused and goes to check. Turns out my waiter never even put my order in the system. The lady, her name tag said Janet, looked embarrassed as hell. She apologizes and immediately puts my order In says the kitchen will rush it. But now I've been sitting there for almost an hour with nothing but a warm Coke. My food finally comes out, but guess who brings it? Not my original waiter. Janet brings it over with another apology. The chicken tenders are overcooked and the fries are cold. At this point, I'm just hungry and tired, so I eat it anyway. The whole time I'm eating, I can see my waiter at the bar area talking to some girl who's clearly not working there. He's completely forgotten I exist. Never checked on me once after taking my drink order, never refilled my Coke, never even walked past my table. When I'm done eating, I have to wave down Janet again to get my check. He brings it over and I can tell she feels bad about the whole situation. The total was like 18 bucks. Here's where it gets interesting. Janet hands me the check and quietly says, don't worry about tipping Tommy. He didn't earn it tonight and everyone saw what happened. Apparently, this wasn't the first time this kid had pulled this crap. So I pay my $18 cash exact change and leave zero tip as I'm walking.

My daughter Kayla has this rare condition called cleipol file syndrome. Basically, her neck vertebrae are fused together, which means her neck doesn't move like it should and her head sits weird on her shoulders. The doctors explained that if she ever got hurt and someone tried to move her neck the wrong way, she could become paralyzed or worse. When Kayla was 7, we met with this specialist who laid out all the scary scenarios. Accidents, playground falls, sports injuries. Any first responder or doctor who didn't know about her condition might try to stabilize her neck in a way that could permanently damage her spinal cord. The specialist said we needed to make sure medical personnel would know immediately not to manipulate her neck. He recommended getting a medical alert tattoo right on her upper chest. That would be visible even if she was unconscious. At first I thought he was crazy. Tattoo my seven year old. But then he showed me photos of other kids who'd gotten them for similar conditions. They were small, simple, just the basic medical info in clear black letters. The doctor explained that medical jewellery could get lost or removed during trauma care, but a tattoo would always be there. He connected us with a tattoo artist who specialised in medical tattoos and worked with kids. The guy had done hundreds of these procedures and knew exactly how to make it As painless as possible. I talked to Kayla about it, explaining why it was important. She was scared at first, but when I told her it was like getting a special Mark that would keep her safe, she got more interested. The tattoo artist let her pick the font and showed her exactly what it would look like. The actual process took maybe 15 minutes. It was just three lines. Flipple feel syndrome. Do not manipulate neck, and see medical I D. Kayla gripped my hand but didn't cry. The artist gave her stickers afterward and told her she was braver than most adults. He worked on for years. Everything was fine. Kayla's teachers knew about the tattoo, her pediatrician approved of it, and we never had any issues. She actually liked having it because it made her feel special and protected. Then last month, Kayla's school called me to come in for a meeting. I figured it was about her grade.

Sorry for what? She just shakes her head and walks away, disappearing into the crowd of vampires and zombies at our Halloween dance. What the hell was that about? I scanned the dance floor, searching for an explanation. That's when I noticed. Everyone is staring at me. Quick glances that dart away when I make eye contact. A group of sophomores whispering behind their hands. Everyone knows something I don't. I can't even call anyone because my phone's dead. I make my way through the dancing bodies, looking for Tara. Another group goes silent as I pass. Stewart reaches out like he wants to stop me, then pulls his hand back. Has anyone seen Tara? I ask a group near the punch bowl. They exchange looks. One girl's eyes start to water. She just left. Someone finally says, Tara wouldn't leave without me. We came together. We were supposed to leave together. I need to find out what's happening. I marched towards the vice principal standing by the gym entrance, but he sees me coming and actually turns away, pretending to adjust a paper skeleton taped to the wall. Mr. Mulaney? My voice comes out harder than I intend. He won't meet my eyes. Emily, you should. Maybe you should call your parents. My phone's dead. What's going on? It's not my place to say. He clears his throat. Just Go home, please. The way he says these makes my stomach drop. I push through the double doors and to the hallway. The fluorescent lights feel too bright after the dim gymnasium. My footsteps echo as I head toward the parking lot. But I hear crying coming from the girls bathroom. Inside, I found three freshman girls huddled together. When they see me, one of them gasps. What? I asked, clearly fed up. Realization dawns on her for some reason. Oh, my god. You don't know? She whispers. Don't know what? I'm practically shouting now. Somebody posted it on their Instagram story. She holds out her phone with a shaking hand. I reach for it, but another girl yanks her arm back. Don't show her that. Not here. Show me. Before she can, a voice then says my name from the doorway. Emily. It's Missus Walters, the drama teacher. Her face is pale. Come with me. I'll tell you everything. She leads me to her office, closes the door. The silence is suffocating. Sit down, she says gently. I don't want to sit down. I want to know why everyone's treating me like this. There was an incident at your house about two hours ago. My heart stops. The way she said incident makes my blood run cold. Your father, she continues, and suddenly I can't breathe. The police found him in the garage. Dad? My dad who drove me to school this morning. Who reminded me to have fun. Tonight, there was a note on the workbench. Her voice is barely steady. What kind of note? But I already know. Somewhere deep down, I already know. Missus Walters expression shifts, and I see something worse than sadness there. Something like horror. Emily, he's gone. He took his own life this afternoon. The room tilts. No, no, no, no, no. Your mother found him when she got home from work. She's the one who. Missus Walters voice cracks. The paramedics couldn't do anything. He'd been gone for over an hour by the time she got there. I'm shaking my head, backing toward the door. This isn't real. This is a sick Halloween prank note. Missus Walter says, her voice barely a whisper now. Emily, in the note, he confessed. Confessed to what? Her hands are trembling. To hurting children. Multiple children. Over the course of 15 years. The floor drops out from under me. He named them, provided detail.

You're annoying because you helped me pick up my books when I dropped them last month and you didn't even remember doing it. She paused.

The kind where I check my phone every five minutes, hoping you texted back. Started smiling. I couldn't help it. I do the same thing. You what? Check my phone constantly. I like talking to you.

You're annoying because you made me like someone I'd never even met. So what now? She said softly. Now you give me your actual number so I know who I'm talking to. Fine.

I laughed, wondering what made this person text me that. I replied, thank you. The response came back quickly. That wasn't a compliment. I choose to take it as a compliment. I responded with my chin held high. This is why you're annoying, the person said. I frowned. Who is this anyway? I don't know. Their response mocked me. You obviously know I deadpan guess. You'll have to find out, George. I sat up straight in my seat. That was my name. Do I know you? I sent, obviously. I nearly howled. Are you in my grade? Nice try. I tried a few more questions over the next several minutes. Did we have classes together? Did we have mutual friends? Every single one got deflected with responses like, wouldn't you like to know whether boy or just a simple nope, not telling. After 20 minutes, all I got was that they were a girl because of the way they texted. She texted me again that night with just a random, the homework for Hawkins is so stupid. We apparently had the same history teacher, but when I asked what period she had him, she changed the subject to how Hawkins always pronounced Renaissance as rain saunts. This became our pattern over the next few days. She'd text me random things that happened at school and I'd try to figure out who She was she'd see right through it every single time. You're getting predictable, George, she sent one afternoon. How am I predictable? You always try to make me slip up. It's cute, but it's not gonna work. I started making lists in my notes app girls in my history class who might know me well enough to have my number who seemed like they do something like this. The lists got really long really fast, then completely useless. Two weeks in, our conversations became different. She'd send me songs at midnight with this is the vibe RN and no other context. I sent her a meme the next morning that made her respond. I actually laughed out loud in class. Thanks a lot. I thought I almost had her when she texted, saw you almost trip by the stairs today. I definitely almost eaten it on the main staircase earlier, but like 15 people saw it happen. She could have been any one of them. Three weeks in, I realized I was checking my phone constantly throughout the day waiting for her texts like they were the most important thing happening to me. You're still.

Another from my sister said, make sure you're already in Phoenix before she figures it out. I called my mom again and this time she answered sounding perfectly calm. Hi, honey. How are my orchids? How's Aunt Carol's surgery going? Oh, fine. She's recovering. That's amazing since she's posting beach photos from Fort Lauderdale. Right now, silence. And I don't know what you're talking about. You destroyed my credit. You stole my identity. I could practically hear her rolling her eyes. Oh, please, we're your parents, not criminals. We gave you life. The least you can do is help us with this little situation. My voice got sharper. Little situation. You put a 340,000 dollar debt in my name. Well, if you hadn't been so selfish about helping family, we wouldn't have had to do it this way. I hung up and immediately called my bank to freeze everything. Then I called the mortgage company and told them about the fraud, but they said without proof, I was still liable. I drove to the police station at 11 at night and filed identity theft charges against my own parents while crying so hard the officer had to write the statement for me. I called 14 lawyers before finding one who'd take the case. While I was googling how to reverse fraudulent deed transfer, at 3:00am, my mom texted me, you're really going to let your parents be homeless over money? We didn't raise you to be this heartless. I screenshot everything, including the emails where they planned this for months. My lawyer filed an emergency injunction and pressed federal charges since they'd crossed state lines. The F B. I got interested fast because apparently parental identity theft was becoming an epidemic. They froze my parents Phoenix condo and all their accounts when the agent showed up at their door. My mom was in the middle of hosting a dinner party with her new neighbours. She called me screaming that I'd embarrassed her in front of everyone. How could you do this to your own mother? I snapped back asking her how she could have done this to her own daughter. And she said, that's different. We're your parents. We have rights to what's ours. I said, I'm not yours anymore and hung up. The next morning, I got a group text from my siblings calling me dramatic and saying I needed to drop the charges because it's not that big of a deal and family doesn't do this to each other. I replied with screenshots of their emails planning the whole thing. They all blocked me. Yesterday, my mom texted asking if I could at least mail her the orchids since I'm keeping everything else that's theirs. I haven't responded yet because honestly, I'm thinking about it. Dead orchids seem like a perfect gift.

I said yes without knowing what I was really signing up for. The call came while I was halfway through a microwave dinner after my third double shift that week. My mom was sobbing about my aunt's emergency heart surgery and they needed to fly out immediately. My brother was supposedly in Singapore and my sister couldn't leave her kids, so of course, it had to be me. My dad showed up at my apartment an hour later, shoving papers in my face while check in his watch packet. Authorization, emergency repairs, just sign here, here, initial, there, our flights in three hours. The last document was a power of attorney and when I hesitated, he grabbed my shoulders. Sweetheart, you're the only one we can trust with this. You've always been there for us. That was true because every family crisis somehow became my responsibility while my siblings lived their lives. I signed everything because that's what I always did. Three days later, I was watering Mom's orchids when the bank called. I'm calling about your overdue mortgage payment. I laughed and said they had the wrong number, but the woman insisted the deed was transferred to your name four days ago and you're four months behind. The phone slipped and shattered on the tile. I could hear her tinny voice saying foreclosure while I stood frozen. I dove for the mail pile and started ripping open every envelope. Final notice after final notice. Four months of threats they've been hiding. My phone exploded with alerts as my credit score plummeted 70 points in real time. A 340,000 dollar mortgage with four missed payments had just destroyed my entire financial future. I called my dad and he didn't answer. I called my mom and it went straight to voicemail. I called my sister and she picked up on the fifth ring. Oh, hey, what's up? Her voice was too casual, too normal. Did you know mom and dad transferred their house to me? There was silence and, and she said, well, it makes sense. You're the responsible one. Then she hung up on me. I ran to their home office and found their computer still logged in. The email on the screen said Phoenix Retirement Plan. And my hands started shaking. They bought a condo in Scottsdale six months ago for cash. They were letting this house go into foreclosure, but under my name, not theirs. An email from my brother said, she's too nice.

Noah was diagnosed with autism when he was 3. He's 7 now, brilliant with numbers, loves trains more than anything and gives the best hugs when he's comfortable with you. My mother never got comfortable. From the diagnosis day, she acted like Noah had something contagious. She'd visit my sister Rebecca every weekend, babysit her twins, Tyler and Madison whenever needed, take them shopping, to movies, to restaurants. Noah got 10 minute visits where she'd stand by the door checking her watch. Rebecca's kids called her Nana. Noah called her Missus Dorothy because she never corrected him to use anything warmer. I tried explaining autism to her so many times. He's not broken, mom. His brain just works differently. She'd nod and change the subject. When family gatherings happened, she'd set up activities for Tyler and Madison, but nothing Noah could participate in. They play charades while Noah sat alone with his tablet. She'd bring special treats for the twins. But forget Noah couldn't eat certain textures. Every birthday, Tyler and Madison got elaborate parties at her house. Noah's birthday got a card with a twenty dollar Bill. The favoritism was obvious, but I kept hoping she'd come around. Then came Christmas last year. We all gathered at Mom's house like always. Tyler and Madison, now 10, raced to the tree where identical wrapped boxes waited. Tore them open. To find the latest ipads, complete with expensive cases and prepaid App Store cards, $500 each easily. Noah watched from the corner, flapping his hands with excitement. He loved unwrapping presents. The paper crinkling was one of his favorite sounds. Mom handed him a small, poorly wrapped gift. Inside was a half used coloring book with pages already colored in, clearance sticker still attached showing 99 cents, not even new, used from a dollar store. Noah didn't understand the insult. He just saw a gift and hugged it saying, thank you, missus Dorothy in her sweet voice. But Tyler understood. Madison understood. They exchanged looks that said even they knew this was wrong. Rebecca stayed silent. My wife Laura gripped my hand so hard it hurt. Mom smiled like she'd done something generous. At least it's something he can actually use, she said, you know, with his limitations. That's when I stood up. Noah, Buddy, go to the car with Mommy. We're leaving. Laura took Noah out while he clutched his pathetic coloring book.

My daughter Amy lost her first baby two years ago. He was still born at 38 weeks. They were gonna name him Philip. When she came home from the hospital, she couldn't even look at the nursery. She asked us to take it all down before she got back. Every single thing, the crib, the changing table, the little elephant mobile we'd hung together. She kept his ultrasound pictures and a tiny lock of his hair in a memory box. Everything else had to go. My husband's sister, Vanessa, had given Amy this expensive stroller at the baby shower. When we started donating things, Vanessa lost her mind. She called Amy hysterical. She told everyone at Sunday dinner that taking down a nursery was ridiculous and dramatic. She said Amy needed to grow up and face reality. I had to physically stand between them at one point because Amy was shaking so hard she could barely breathe. We banned Vanessa from family stuff for six months. She only came back after promising she'd never mention Philip again. Fast forward to last month, Amy's pregnant again, 26 weeks with a girl. We threw her a baby shower at my house. I invited Vanessa because my husband begged me to keep the peace. Big mistake. The whole afternoon, Vanessa whispered to people. I heard her tell my neighbor we were tacky for throwing a second baby shower. She Told my husband's cousin that Amy was milking the tragedy for attention and free stuff. I watched her roll her eyes every time someone congratulated Amy, but she stayed away from my daughter, so I bit my tongue. Then Amy started opening presents. There were these tiny pink onesies with bunnies on them.

I watched her roll her eyes every time someone congratulated Amy. But she stayed away from my daughter, so I bit my tongue. Then Amy started opening presents. There were these tiny pink onesies with bunnies on them. A handmade blanket from her best friend, Amy. He was smiling for the first time in months, really smiling. And I felt like I could finally breathe. That's when Vanessa spoke up, loud enough for everyone to hear. You know, if you hadn't torn apart Philip's nursery and thrown everything away like it meant nothing, you wouldn't be sitting here begging people for gifts. The room went silent. Amy's hands stopped moving. She just stared at the wall with this blank look on her face. And then tears started rolling down her cheeks. She didn't make a sound. Just tears. I grabbed Vanessa's gift from the pile, walked to the front door, and threw it onto the driveway. The box split open, and some glass thing inside shattered on the concrete. Get out! I said, right now. Vanessa crossed her arms. I'm not leaving. I have every right to be here. Someone needs to tell the truth. I completely lost it. Get out of my house! Screamed it so loud, my throat hurt. My husband ran in from the garage, where he'd been helping his dad load chairs into the car. His mom explained what happened, and without saying a word, he picked up Vanessa like she weighed nothing and carried her out the door. She was yelling the whole time about how we were all enabling Amy's weakness. He set her down on the porch and said, don't come back. Amy left the shower early. She didn't even take the gifts. Just grabbed her purse and walked out to her car while people were still standing around in shock.

He grabbed his phone off the table and pulled up his messages again. Your own best friend, Lily, told me I saw your girlfriend with another guy at a restaurant in town. I don't want to betray her, but no one deserves to be cheated on. Those were the words that broke me. My best friend turned against me. Tears finally fell from my eyes, rolling down my cheeks as I sobbed. It's not true, I said. None of this is true. I didn't understand why my friend and his friends would lie to him about me. I was so confused. His face was red and spittle flew from his lips as he said, I never should have trusted you with my heart. You broke my heart by cheating and I'll never love again. Just admit what you did. The more I denied it, the more angry he became. Just let me go, I said, trying to duck around him. He slammed his hands against the wall, caging me in and refusing to let me go. Fear filled me even more and I nearly choked on my spit. I had nowhere to go. This was when my fight or flight response kicked. I shoved at his chest hard enough to shove him back a step. I stepped around him and hurried toward the door, but he leaped after me and grabbed my arm with a grip that would leave bruises. I hissed in pain. And wrenched my arm free. Leave me alone, I snapped. I'm going. I don't want to stay with someone who would believe his friends over his girlfriend. I moved toward the door again. When it happened, he spun me around and slapped me across the face hard enough for my head to snap to the side. I froze. He froze in shock. Calmness suddenly spread through me. As I turned to look at him, my tears dried instantly. I stepped toward the door and he didn't follow me, probably too shocked at his own behavior to stalk after me. I knew what I had to do. I'm done, I said coldly. I won't stay with someone who raises a hand to me. Find yourself a new girlfriend. I'm done living in fear of what you might do to me. I turned and strolled out of the front door without looking back.

My dad died when my mom was 8 months pregnant with me. She already had my brother, who's basically our dad's clone. Same face, same walk, even the same laugh, apparently. And my mom, she's been living through him ever since. Like when I graduated valedictorian, she left halfway through my speech because my brother texted he needed a ride from his buddies house. When I got engaged, she spent the entire entire dinner showing my fiance photos of my brother's high school football highlights from 10 years ago. But I'm the idiot who keeps trying. So I invite her to my gender reveal party, thinking maybe, just maybe, she'll actually show up for me this time. My husband thinks I'm setting myself up for disappointment, but I tell him this is different. This is about her grandchild. She has to care about that. The party is actually going amazing at first. We've got 60 people here, custom decorations, and these insane fireworks my husband special ordered that'll explode in either pink or blue. Then my mom plants herself right in front of the reveal area where we're supposed to light the fireworks. We're waiting for your brother. She announces to everyone he's family and deserves to be here. I tell her we're starting at three PM as planned. She doesn't move. These things can wait. People are starting to stare, pulling Out their phones, whispering. My mother in law steps forward, saying we should stick to schedule. My mom gets louder. What kind of person excludes her own brother from such an important moment? The entire party goes silent. Kids are asking their parents what's happening. I try to walk around her, but she literally grabs my arm. Your brother is 15 minutes away. We're waiting. My cousin starts defending me, saying this is my party, my choice. Other relatives jump in, defending my mom, saying family is family. It's turning into this whole scene with everyone taking sides. My husband finally says enough and goes to get the fireworks himself so we can just do this. He comes back. Haley! The entire box is gone. Vanished. I'm searching everywhere, my dress getting dirty from checking behind bushes, under tables. Guests are grabbing their stuff, saying they have other commitments and can't wait around. My mom sitting there calmly sipping wine. Maybe this is a sign. We should wait for your brother. He's so close now. My best friend whispers that she thinks my mom

Others are nodding, but we can't prove anything. Suddenly, there's this massive boom from behind the house, then crackles filling the air. Pop, pop, pop. Echoing through the neighborhood. My husband and I sprint outside and the sky is exploding in bright blue fireworks, blue spirals shooting higher than the trees. Someone is setting off our gender reveal. We're having a boy. But the fireworks are coming from the empty lot behind our house. Everyone scream. I'm in confusion. Half the people missed it because they were inside. Others are recording on their phones trying to catch the tail end. My aunt's freaking that this wasn't the plan. Some guests look excited, others furious. I'm standing there crying because, yes, I'm having a son, but also because someone just stole this moment. Then through the smoke, I see a figure stumbling around in the empty lot. It's my brother, beer in hand, laughing like this is the funniest thing ever. He's shouting something at my mom, but I can't make out the words. My mom's face has this weird expression, not surprised exactly, but something else, proud. But why would she do this? My mom starts making the speech about how surprises make the best memories, while my brother stumbles over, reeking of beer and gunpowder. He's grinning at her like a kid who just won a prize. Did I do good, mom? You said the empty lot would be perfect. Everyone freezes. My mom tries to recover. Saying she thought it would be special if my brother participated as a surprise. But people aren't buying it. You deliberately ruined your daughter's gender reveal, my friend says. My mom gets defensive, says I'm always excluding my brother from important moments that siblings should share, milestones. My husband tells them both to leave immediately. As my mom's gathering her purse, she starts crying about how my dad would have wanted his son included, how my brother deserves to be part of every family Celebration. She actually says, your father loved your brother so much, he would understand why I did this. That's when I lose it completely because last month I found my dad's journal while cleaning out the attic. He'd written an entry the day before he died talking about the baby girl he couldn't wait to meet. He wrote, I hope she knows she was wanted, planned for, already loved. He'd even picked out my name. So, no, mom, I don't think dad would understand at all.

I got home from my college classes to find my boyfriend sitting on the couch in the living room. The TV was on with a PlayStation game playing. He seemed frozen in his seat. He turned slowly when I entered the room, his eyebrows drawn together and a frown on his face. Do you have something to tell me? He asked. I frowned. What do you mean? I was confused by his attitude. He sighed and pulled out his phone. Why am I getting texts from an unknown number telling me you've been cheating on me? I froze, anxiety rising as my cheeks reddened with anger and disbelief. Seriously, I asked. You would believe some random number? I would never cheat on you. See, how can I believe you when you won't talk to me? His voice rose with frustration. I felt panicky and my hands were sweating. I talk to you all the time. I pretend I couldn't believe this was happening. He was always accusing me of things, but this was taking it too far. He pulled up a group chat with his closest friends and began reading the messages to me. Stan tells me your girlfriend is cheating on you with some guy. Dave said, did you hear about your girlfriend? And this guy, Liam, added, I caught your girlfriend and another guy at the local coffee shop the other day. I thought you should know. He slammed his Phone down on the coffee table and narrowed his eyes at me. Are you going to admit it now? I shook my head in shock. I couldn't believe his friends would turn on me like that. I have no idea what they're talking about, I said quietly. You would believe them over me. Do you even have any real proof? He rose to his feet and began pacing around the room. They wouldn't lie to me, he muttered to himself. He turned on me in anger, fists balled at his sides. Just tell me the truth, he screamed those words at me, startling me. His anger went from zero to 100 in a second. I quickly backed away from him, fear rising. I've witnessed his rage before, but it has never terrified me before. He advanced on me until my back hit the wall and I had nowhere else to go. I never cheated on you, I insisted.

Logan had been complaining for weeks that I hovered too much. When we went out at his company's holiday party, he pulled me aside near the coat check. Listen. Tonight, can you just not be so attached to me? My coworkers think it's weird how you're always by my side. Just mingle on your own. For once, I smiled sweetly. Of course, babe, I'll give you tons of space. Really? You're not upset? Not at all. You want independence at parties? You got it. The party was at this upscale rooftop venue, open bar, DJ, the Works. Logan immediately ditched me to bro out with his work buddies, leaving me by the entrance. Perfect. I walked straight to the bar where his boss, Thomas, was getting drinks. Emily, where's Logan? Oh, he wanted space. Tonight, I'm flying solo. Thomas looked confused at his own company party. He says I'm too clingy, didn't want me cramping his style. Thomas's wife, Diane overheard. He left you alone. How rude. No worries. I'll just entertain myself. And I did. I ended up in a fascinating conversation with the CFO about cryptocurrency. Then the head of HR pulled me into their group to settle a debate about true crime podcasts. I was having a genuinely great time. An hour in, I caught Logan's eye across the room. He was with his bros but kept glancing over As I laughed with his supervisors, then the DJ started playing salsa music. This gorgeous guy from Accounting, Javier, asked if I could dance. I'd love to. We tore up that dance floor. Turns out Javier was a semi professional dancer. He spun me, dipped me the whole nine yards. A crowd formed to watch. Logan appeared suddenly. Hey, maybe we should, oh, am I being too clingy? I asked mid spin. No, I just, great. Then you won't mind if I keep dancing. Javier dipped me dramatically. Crowd cheered. Logan retreated to the bar Downing whiskey with his confused buddies. Later, the CEO's wife pulled me aside. You're Logan's girlfriend. We need to talk. She dragged me to her table full of executives wives. They immediately adopted me, pouring champagne and gossiping about everyone. Logan usually brags about you non stop. One said, where is he? He needed guy time. Apparently I hover. They exchanged looks. Men are idiots, the CEO's wife declared, raising her glass. Toasted to that. Logan kept trying to approach, but every time he got close, someone else would pull me into conversation. His female co workers wanted workout tips. The it guys needed restaurant recommendations. Even the janitor asked for relationship advice. Everyone loved me except Logan who looked increasingly miserable. Then came the speeches. CEO grabbed the mic thanking everyone for their hard work. Special shout out to Emily for bringing such amazing energy tonight. Logan, you're a lucky man. Everyone clapped looking Around for Logan. He was sulking by the bathroom. Where's Logan? The CEO asked into the mic. He wanted space, someone yelled. Laughter erupted. The CEO's wife grabbed the mic. Well, his loss. Emily's been the life of the party. More cheering. Logan's face went red. Around midnight, the party was winding down. I was ex.

So I'm dating Mitchell. He's 56, I'm 28. And, yes, he's rich. Like, really rich. We met at the Starbucks, where I was working on my laptop. He loved that I wasn't trying to get his attention and that I added to my coffee, in his words, more sugar than the Boston Harbor needed in 1773. But here's what six months of dating him actually looks like. Waiters hand him the wine list, never me. His friends, wives talk to me like I'm five, explaining what investment means really slowly. The valley gives Mitchell my car keys every single time. At his country club, someone always asks what I'm studying. I graduated four years ago. Last week, his lawyer asked if I needed help reading the dinner menu. It had seven items on it. Mitchell's company Christmas party is everything I expected and worse. I'm wearing this gorgeous Chanel dress that I bought myself because I liked it, and not even five minutes in, one of the wives pulls me into the bathroom. She puts her hand on my shoulder like she's about to deliver terrible news, and tells me I need to save the money Mitchell gives me for when this ends. When I mention having my own money, she laughs like I've told a joke and presses her friend's financial advisor card into my hand. And he specializes in girls like me, apparently. Mitchell gets pulled into a work Emergency. Leaving me at the bar, where his colleagues don't bother lowering their voices. How much do you think Mitchell spends on her monthly? One says, worth every penny at that age. Another answers, cheaper than my boat maintenance. When I approach and mention my startup work, they find it hilarious. One actually asks if Mitchell taught me the word portfolio. Another suggests I'm confusing shopping with investing. Then the boss himself walks over with his champagne and says the most insulting thing yet. When you and Mitchell are done, you should date my son. He's more age appropriate and needs a pretty girl. I say, I don't need anyone to take care of me, but he just pats my head like I'm a golden retriever. We all know what you need. Heart. I'm about to tell him exactly what I needed in that moment when I hear Mitchell's voice from the conference room. The door is cracked open, and he's on speaker phone, negotiating to buy a tech company. The seller is refusing his 10 million offer, insisting it's worth more, but won't explain why. Mitchell sounds increasingly desperate, repeatedly asking what he's missing. That's when my blood runs cold. I know this company. I know it intimately. I know exactly what Mitchell is missing. I push into the conference room. Before I can stop myself, Mitchell looks up, irritated at the interruption. He tells the seller on the phone, sorry, my girlfriend just wandered in. I'm already scanning the Papers spread across the table, confirming what I suspected. The seller's voice crackles through the speaker, asking what's going on. I state simply that the company has three major clients not listed in the disclosure. Mitchell freezes. The seller's voice turns sharp, demanding to know how I could possibly know that. Mitchell starts apologizing for my intrusion, while the CEO appears in the doorway. Mitchell, that's confidential information. You shouldn't be sharing these things. His wife laughs, suggesting I overheard something, and I'm trying to sound smart, but I continue.

I was the only night keeper at our aquarium who could handle Poseidon, our four million dollar giant Pacific octopus. And that evening he wrapped all eight arms around my forearm to gently pull crab from my beating tongues. His massive 200 pound body moved with surprising Grace through the crystal clear water of his tank. But when any other keeper approached, the same gentle creature became a destructive nightmare that sprayed black ink everywhere and destroyed thousands of dollars it's worth of equipment. Our new operations director Caroline watched from the observation deck with her arms crossed, clearly unimpressed by what she called my animal dependency problem during yesterday's staff meeting. She believed every creature should have multiple handlers because no single employee should be irreplaceable, especially not because of some oversized sea creature that cost more than most people's houses. Caroline had spent three weeks documenting every minor violation she could manage. Manufacturer writing me up for wearing a different brand of reef safe sunscreen than the one corporate required even though their brand gave me hives and docking my pay. When Poseidon's complex eating routine ran five minutes over my scheduled break, her masterpiece was hiring Tim, her former assistant manager who spent entire shifts taking Instagram selfies near the shark tank and had never worked with cephalopods in his 24 years of existence. Poseidon hated Tim with a burning intensity of a thousand suns shooting Pressurized water jets that soaked him completely whenever he approached the tank. And once Tim slipped so dramatically on the wet observation deck that he crashed through a three thousand dollar interactive display about octopus intelligence. Tim's solution was to stand 15 feet away from the tank and throw food pellets like he was feeding pigeons at the park, which made Poseidon retreat to his cave and refuse to eat for two entire days. Then disaster struck on Wednesday evening when major marine research donors were arriving for a private feeding demonstration at 8:30, specifically to see our famous octopus interact with his primary caregiver. Twenty minutes before the VIP tour, Caroline cornered me in the equipment room while I prepared Poseidon's dinner of fresh dungeness crab and puzzle feeders. Tim will handle tonight's demonstration, she announced with fake authority dripping from every word. You're needed in the children's touch tank area for deep cleaning duties. Everyone in that equipment room knew exactly what would happen if Tim approached Poseidon during feeding time, when the octopus was most territorial and aggressive. But I looked Caroline directly in the eyes and explained the obvious anyway. Poseidon won't accept food from Tim and he becomes violent when strangers approach during his dinner routine. Caroline snapped back that we'd manage without the feeding demonstration and gave me a direct order to report to the children's area immediately or face consequences. I slowly unclipped my security badge and identification card, placing both items On the stainless steel prep counter. While our senior aquarist and two night staff members watched this confrontation unfold in stunned silence, I pulled out my phone to start recording and told Caroline that the sighting was in full hunting mode because it was feeding time and Tim knew where all the equipment was stored. Caroline's face turned bright red when she realized I was documenting our conversation for legal. If you walk out of this building, you're terminated immediately and permanently. I replied calmly that this was perfectly fine with me, already hearing Poseidon's agitated flashing echoing from the deep sea exhibit rooms away. I'm recording this for unemployment documentation since you're firing me for refusing to endanger a four million dollar animal and potentially injure your completely inexperienced employee. I walked out of the building and barely made it to the parking lot before my phone started buzzing with frantic calls and text messages.

She returned 6 years later to find I divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years Max. Don't change the locks. He left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation to our 8 year olds. That first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decisions. No more walking on eggshells around her mood swings. Year 1 was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curve ball in our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year 2 brought unexpected changes without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. His grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I'd been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd forgotten how to Enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake, cook, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her Bonus Mom, their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes and tucked them in at night. Year 5 was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and be being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year 6, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward after three Years of zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from in the living room. Through the window, we watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck, pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she owned the place. Eleanor was packing the twins lunches for.

I had sworn I would never talk to my little sister Mia again, not after she picked that scumbag, Blake, over our entire family. For 2 whole years, I stuck to my word like it was carved in stone. Blake was the guy who got our cousin Jenny hooked on pills. He would sell them to her behind the school, then act all innocent when she overdosed in the bathroom during homecoming. Annie barely survived and our whole family watched her go through hell trying to get clean. when I tried to warn Mia about what kind of person Blake really was, she laughed in my face. You're just jealous I have someone. She, I said, you can't stand seeing me happy for once. That was the night I told her if she stayed with him, she was dead to me. She chose him. So I chose to forget I had a sister. For 2 years, I never called, never texted, never checked her Instagram or asked our parents how she was doing. When people brought her up, I would literally walk away. I told everyone, including our mom, I, I don't care if she's dying, I'm never talking to her again. My friends thought I was being dramatic. My parents kept begging me to reach out. But I had made a promise to myself and I was going to keep it no matter what. Then last Tuesday around midnight, Someone started pounding on my apartment door like the building was on fire. When, when I opened it, this dirty, sweating mess of a man pushed right past me into my living room. I recognized him instantly, Blake. He looked like he hadn't slept in days. His clothes were torn up. His hair was greasy. And he kept looking over his shoulder like someone was chasing him. That's when I noticed the kitchen knife tucked into his waistband. I need a place to hide, he said, pacing around my couch like a caged animal.

So my whole family had been using my Amazon Prime account for like three years. My mom, my sister Ashley, my Uncle Rick. Even my grandma somehow figured out how to order stuff. I was paying for it because I actually use Amazon all the time for work stuff and groceries, but they were just leeching off it. The breaking point happened two weeks ago. I check my account and see 17 packages coming to different addresses. 17! My sister ordered a whole workout set she'll never use. My mom got some fancy face cream that cost 60 bucks, and my Uncle Rick ordered a drone he definitely doesn't need. But the worst part was my cousin Blake ordered a gaming chair that cost $400. I called Blake and asked him what the hell he was thinking. He just laughed and said it's not his problem. I gave everyone access. He said if I didn't want people using it, I shouldn't have shared the password. This kid just graduated high school and acts like he runs the world. So I called my mum and told her everyone needed to chip in for prime or get their own accounts. She got all dramatic and said family should help each other out. She reminded me how she used to buy me clothes when I was younger. I told her that was literally her job as a parent and not the same thing at all. Then Ashley calls me crying, saying she can't afford her own prime account because she's saving for a wedding. I reminded her that her wedding is in two years and she just spent $300 on workout clothes she returned last month. She said I was being petty and that it's only like $10 a month split between everyone. I did the math. If everyone chipped in 10 bucks, that would actually cover prime and give me extra money. But when I suggested this in our family group chat, suddenly everyone had excuses. My mom said she's on a fixed income. Ashley said she's saving for the wedding. Rick said he barely uses it anyway, which is a lie because he ordered protein powder just yesterday. The final straw was when my grandma called me, confused about why her soap order got cancelled. Turns out my account got flagged for fishes activity. Because there were so many different addresses, Amazon temporarily locked my account and I couldn't order my medication refills. That's when I snapped. I changed the password and removed everyone's.

I responded, bros before hoes, but moms before all. And everyone cracked up. Jason didn't smile, though. His face drained of color, like I just confessed to murder. He grabbed all his stuff and moved three rows up the school bus without a word. Jason, what's wrong? I was just kidding. I called after him, but he wouldn't turn around. That's when I heard it. Casey, my girlfriend's best friend, was crying her eyes out in the back row. When I turned to look, her friend whispered urgently in her ear, and she glanced at me before crying harder. Okay, that was definitely weird. I started to wonder whether my joke was really that offensive. That's when my phone buzzed. Three missed calls from dad, but there was no signal. And at the red light, I caught the bus driver wiping his eyes in the rearview mirror. In my three years of knowing him, the most emotion he'd shown was mild annoyance when kids left trash on the seats. A cold feeling crept into my stomach. I got up to go talk to Jason, but missus unfit Harris blocked the aisle. Sit down. We're moving. I just need to sit down. I'd never heard her voice like that. I sat, but the second we got to the destination, I cornered Jason. Dude, what is going on? He backed away. Nothing. I just. I need space. Bro, I was just kidding. I don't know if I'd pick my mom or my girlfriend. Why did you have to tell everyone what I said? Sid appeared out of nowhere and pulled me aside. Our team captain, who never said more than pass the ball all to me, grabbed my shoulders. Bro, if you need to talk about anything, I'm here. About what? I was almost shouting. Now he just squeezed my shoulder and walked away. That cold feeling in my stomach was spreading. During the water break, Ryan shuffled over. This kid didn't even know my name. Oh, the blonde Kaylee from volleyball thinks you're cute. She's single now, too. The words hit like a punch. Dude, what the hell? I flashed him my lock screen. I have a girlfriend. His face went white. Just trying to help you move forward, man. Move forward from what? He practically ran away. I tried calling my girlfriend Isabella on the public landline. Right then straight to voicemail. I must have called 15 times. I was losing my mind. Everyone felt so bad for me that no one even forced me back on the field to play. As soon as lunch hit, I grabbed Jason more aggressively this time. Tell me what's happening now. Now! I can't. He was typing frantically in his notes app. You can't or you won't? His girlfriend Ava, read over his shoulder, then slapped him hard. How Could you not tell him, you coward? She stormed off. Jason did. Something happened to Isabella. He wouldn't look at me, just kept typing. That's when Stacy walked by. She saw me and her face twisted with rage. You never deserved a girl like you, Isabella. I always told her she deserved better. Her friend clamped a hand over her mouth and dragged her away. My head was spinning. I stumbled to the vending machines where the coaches were arguing. He has a right to know now, Mrs. Griffin hissed. There's no point. The decision has already been made. Mrs. Fitzharris shot back. Somebody tell me what's happening! I shouted. They scattered like roaches. It wasn't until the bus ride back that Jason spoke to me again. By that point, I was so sick of everyone's BS that I just wanted to show him the Minecraft base I've been working on. We were ten minutes away from the

With his phone charged and ready, right on schedule, Rick emerged from his house at two PM, looked around to make sure no one was watching, walked over to our porch. With that same casual stride he perfected over months of systematic theft, dad hit record as Rick grabbed the package and headed back to his house. This time, dad actually followed him outside, filming from across the street as Rick disappeared through his front door with what he thought was another free prize. We waited inside. Dad kept checking his watch. Mom asked what was happening, but dad just held up one finger and smiled. About 20 minutes later, we heard, heard this blood curdling scream from Rick's house. Then another one, then what sounded like furniture being thrown around and someone having a complete meltdown. Dad was grinning like it was Christmas morning. Five minutes after that, Rick's front door flew open and he stumbled out looking like he'd been attacked by a craft store explosion. Bright rainbow glitter covered every inch of him. He looked absolutely ridiculous, like a very angry, very sparkly unicorn who'd lost a fight with a party supply store. That's when Dad's real masterpiece revealed itself. Two official vehicles pulled up to Rick's house. United States Postal Inspection Service agents got out with handcuffs and evidence bags. Turns out dad had been coordinating with them for weeks. The glitter explosion wasn't just petty revenge. It was the final piece of evidence they Needed to catch Rick in the act and build an airtight federal case against him. They arrested him right there in his driveway while he was still sparkling like a human disco ball.

My dad caught our neighbor stealing packages off our porch but didn't say a word to anyone about it for months. This has been going on since we moved to the neighborhood. We'd get delivery notifications but find nothing at our door. My mom kept complaining to Amazon about missing packages, filing reports, getting refunds. The neighbor was smart about it, too. Rick, who worked from home and had perfected his technique. He'd wait exactly 15 minutes after the delivery truck left, then casually stroll over like he was checking his own mail, grab our stuff and head back inside like nothing happened. Dad started keeping a notebook, times, dates, what got stolen. Mom thought he was being obsessive, but he had a plan brewing. He started ordering worthless junk online just to mess with Rick. Expired vitamins from sketchy websites, broken phone accessories that didn't work, random magazines about hobbies nobody cares about. Stuff that cost almost nothing but came in official looking packages that would bull a thief. Every few days, another decoy package would arrive. Rick kept taking them like clockwork, probably thinking he'd hit the Jackpot. With neighbors who ordered so much stuff, dad would place the order and wait by the window with his notebook. This went on for three weeks. Dad was building something but wouldn't tell us what. Then dad escalated phase 2. He found this website that sells glitter packages specifically designed For pranking, package thieves ordered the biggest one they had, the kind that explodes rainbow glitter everywhere when someone opens it. The description promised it would take weeks to clean up. But he also made a phone call. Turns out his college roommate, Tom, works for the United States Postal Inspection Service. Dad had been documenting everything for weeks, times, dates, photos through the window, even video footage of Rick's theft routine. Stealing mail is a federal crime and Tom explained they'd been looking for solid evidence against repeat offenders in our area. Dad had basically built them a perfect case without realizing it. The morning the glitter explosive arrived, dad positioned himself at the.

I feel like I'm in hell. I can't give you too much pain medication that will make your condition worse. I got one final confession to make. What's left? I cheated on your taxes. I'm a murderer. I killed my business partner. I shot him in the head and made it look like suicide. And he was just the first. And you killed more? Three or four. Try not to kill anyone else until I get back.

Yeah, yeah. I got a couple of tickets. I thought the show was about the magician. You want her? Yeah. Maybe you can take your girl. No, I don't think so. Why not? She stood me up. I was standing outside the theater for two hours and she never showed up. What? You gonna let her treat you that way and get away with it? Listen, if I was you, I'd go find that girl, take her by the hair and shake her like an etch a sketch DOC lives alone. Well, she does owe me an explanation. Now you're talking. Well, here's your chance. Hey, Chris. Oh, hey. What happened to you yesterday? That's right. We were supposed to go see footloose. I totally forgot. I didn't know it then, but for years to come, I dated an awful lot of women with amnesia. Oh, that's right. We're supposed to go to the prom together. I totally forgot. That's right. We were supposed to do something for your birthday. Totally forgot. Oh, that's right. I was supposed to give you a kidney. Boy, I forgot all about you. Until I got famous, I never met a woman that could remember anything. So maybe we can go Saturday. Hmm. This Saturday. I can't. I have a panelist. Are you free Sunday? I have to go clean the house. Too bad. I got these Houdini tickets for Sunday afternoon at the Park for real. Yeah, right here. You know what? Maybe I can go. So I'll see you Sunday then. Alright, Sunday what? That girl is not interested in you. She's interested in your tickets. You think so? She's an opportunist. She goes with whoever has the best deal. She only agreed to go out with you because she didn't have anything better to do. That's how I ended up mad for three years. I don't think you vets like that. I'll make a bet. I didn't want to believe DOC was right about evet, so I decided to see for myself. Hey, evet. Yes, Chris. Hi. Listen about those tickets. Yeah, I found out they were fake for real. But you know, we can still go to a movie. Yeah, I found out that this is a new movie. Hey, Chris. Hey, can I talk to you for a minute? I hope she doesn't have something better to do. What? How come you didn't tell me you just didn't want to go out with me? Instead of dissing me like that, like what? Like leaving me out in front of the movie theater like a fool, like say you wanna go with me to go see Houdini and hanging up in my face. You said the tickets were fake. I thought you were going because you wanted to go out with me. Why did you even agree to go out with me in the first place? Because I don't have Anything better to do? Why don't you say that I was trying not to hurt your feelings. Well, you know, you really suck at that. Well, what do you want me to do? You know what? Nothing. I asked a bet out after I got famous. She stood me up and went out with Chris Tucker. You handle that like a man, Chris. You still got those tickets? Yeah. Why? I got this young honey on the line and she loves rap. Have fun. You know I will, man. The first time I asked a girl to go out with me and this happened, hey, at least it ended better than this.

What happened? It was an accident. Um, I choked him out. I had to. I just want you to tell me, tell me what happened. I was driving, talking with Bella, my wife. The boys were in the back. Jamie was playing with his iPad. Dylan grabbed it from him, wouldn't give it back. Jamie can't control his anger, started punching Dylan, got out of the seatbelt and got on top of him, kept pounding. Bella couldn't pull him off. I could hear Jamie's fists cracking against Dylan's face. He was screaming for help. So I pulled over, just threw myself on top of Jamie, wrap my arms around him and hold him as tight as I could. When he gets like this, the bear hugs are the only thing that bring him back, bring him back from his dark place. Jamie, how you doing? I'm Doctor Charles. Would you mind if I look at your hands? Fifth metacarpals broken on each hand. This really got to hurt. We're gonna get you completely fixed up. Okay, it's nice to meet you. This is not child abuse. After two miscarriages and five failed IVF attempts, we had enough heartbreak. We adopted Jamie when he was a few days old. Do you know anything about his birth parents? Nothing really. Um, mom was young in foster care. We don't know anything about dad. Well, Jamie's 11 now, so how old was He, when he first started acting out as an infant, he didn't like being held, was always fidgety. How about as a toddler? I'm sitting still, taking turns, following directions. They were all a challenge. When did Jamie's behavior start becoming aggressive? Elementary school fights with classmates and teachers. We're homeschooling now. And your other son, Dylan, is he adopted as well? Yeah. This initially Jamie's idea. You wanted to be a big brother. And in the beginning, Dylan's presence seemed to calm Jamie. He would push his stroller, feed him his bottle, let him climb all over him. They are so close. I'm assuming that Jamie's been evaluated by a psychiatrist, several. They all just had to the diagnosis. Intermittent explosive disorder, comorbid ADHD, disruptive mood disorder. What meds is he on right now? Risperidone, valproic acid, lithium, adrenergic. They all work for a bit, but then he always ends up in a dark place. Mr Mrs. Shaw, Dylan's out of surgery. I'll take him to recovery. Look, what I'd like to do is admit Jamie for a five day hold. That'll give us a chance to assess the situation and come up with some treatment options for you. Anything, please, just help him.

Stop it! I wish I could tell you exactly what happened in there, what would trigger Jamie, but honestly, I can't. I have reviewed his medical records, I've spoken with several of his doctors, and what is clear to me is that your son is struggling with multiple impulse control and mood regulation disorders. So what do we do? We just want to help him. Well, it's the hospital's recommendation that Jamie be admitted to a residential facility where he can receive sustained clinical care as well as supportive therapy. Residential facility? Yeah. Mrs. Shawn, Jamie's eleven. Puberty is fast approaching, and. And that surge of hormones is just gonna undoubtedly exacerbate his conditions. It just make him more difficult to treat in general. You know, find the right balance of meds. And a specialized setting like this will have the behavioral resources Jamie needs for the future. And it'll be a safe place for him right now.

Call the police first. My husband Derek was already reaching for his phone before I could even process what I just read. What the, how does that mean? His voice came out harsh and panicked as he dialed Kira's number. She didn't pick up. I tried calling too. My hands shaking so badly I almost dropped my phone straight to voicemail. We'd left our seven year old daughter Zoe at home with Kira because we'd driven two hours away from my sister's surprise birthday dinner.

Derek was already pulling on his jeans when another text came through from Kira. I'm hiding in Zoe's closet with her. Someone broke in through the basement window. We can hear them downstairs. Oh my god. I called 9 1 1 while Derek grabbed the car keys and we were running to the parking lot before the operator even finished asking for our address. The dispatcher stayed on the line as we peeled out of my sister's driveway at 3:00am, promising that officers were already being dispatched to our house. She Asking me questions I couldn't answer. Do you have security cameras? Does anyone else have a key? Has anyone been watching your house? All I could think about was Zoe hiding in that tiny closet, probably terrified, probably wondering why her parents weren't there to protect her. Drive home felt like it took years, even though Derek was going 20 miles over the speed limit the entire way. The 9 1 1 operator told us at 3:00am that officers had arrived at our house and were surrounding the property. She said we needed to stay away until they secure the scene. But Derek just drove faster. I texted Kira again desperately, are you okay? Is Zoe okay? The message showed as delivered but not read. My mind went to the darkest possible places as we flew down the empty highway. What if the intruder had found them? What if Kira's phone had died? What if we were already too late? 3:00am, my phone rang with a number I didn't recognize. This is Officer Williams with the police department. Your babysitter and daughter are safe. The suspect fled before we arrived, but we have units searching the area. Relief flooded through me so intensely I started crying. Derek's hands were gripping the steering wheel so hard his knuckles were white. We pulled up to our house at 408:00am to find five police cars parked on our street with their lights flashing. Our front door was wide open and officers were walking Through with flashlights.

Everyone laughed except me. I quietly raised my hot dog and said, challenge accepted. That night, I packed everything into two suitcases and left my key on the kitchen counter. No, no, no. Goodbye. Just gone. I've been the family doormat for 29 years, the one who organized every holiday, baked every birthday cake, and cleaned up everyone's messes while they took selfies without me. So when mom made that joke at our BBQ with my aunts and siblings all laughing, something inside me just clicked. I moved three hours away to a lakeside cabin, blocked everyone's numbers, and started over as Jade instead of JD, the nickname that made me feel like a child. For the first week, my phone stayed silent, exactly like mom predicted. But week two 2. My brother called 47 times. Turns out nobody knew how to work the washing machine I've been maintaining for years. Their clothes piled up like a laundry mountain until he finally had to buy new underwear instead of figuring out the spin cycle. Week 3, my sister showed up at my old job crying, begging my former co workers for my new number. She had a family emergency, aka couldn't figure out how to renew her car registration. The same registration I've been handling for her since she was 16. My co workers told her I'd Moved states away she broke down in the parking lot because she'd never even Learned where the DMV was located. She ended up paying $300 to some sketchy guy who promised to handle it.

So I hopped on another flight and send these pics to wife, and now she is begging me to return. I was sitting at gate 35, honeymoon tickets in hand, when my phone rang. We've been married for exactly 72 hours. The wedding had been perfect. Expensive, but perfect. My wife Claire's name flashed on the screen, and I smiled, expecting her to tell me she was running late from the hotel. Hey, babe, where are you? Boarding starts in 20 minutes. Silence. Then her voice, tight and nervous. Jake, I can't make the flight. Stomach dropped. What do you mean you can't make it? Are you okay? It's Marcus, she said quickly. Marcus? Her ex boyfriend of five years. The one she swore was just a friend. Now, he texted me this morning there's an emergency with his mom. She practically raised me. I need to be there for him. I sat there processing our honeymoon. The Maldives, two weeks of all inclusive paradise that cost me $14,000. And she was canceling for her ex boyfriend's family emergency. Claire, we can reschedule visiting his mom when we get back. This is our honeymoon. Her voice got defensive. You don't understand. She might not have much time left. Marcus needs support right now. Then he can call his actual family or Literally, anyone else? Like, don't be selfish. I thought you'd understand. Selfish? Three days into our marriage, and I'm selfish for expecting my wife to join me on our honeymoon? So what am I supposed to do? I asked quietly. Just cancel the trip. We'll go another time. I'm really sorry, but this is important. She hung up. I sat there, staring at my boarding pass. Around me, couples were kissing, families were laughing, excited for vacations. I looked at my phone, at our wedding photos still fresh on Instagram, at the messages from friends and family congratulating us. Then something clicked. Strange, cold clarity. I wasn't canceling anything. I opened my laptop, went to the airline website, and changed my return ticket. Then I booked a completely different outbound flight, one way to Barcelona, leaving in three hours from a different terminal. I texted Claire, have a nice time with Marcus. I'll be fine. She responded immediately, thank you for understanding. I love you. I didn't reply. Six hours later, I was sitting at a tapas bar in Las Ramblas, watching the sunset paint the Mediterranean orange and pink. I posted a photo, just me, a glass of wine, and the caption, when life gives you a canceled honeymoon, you take yourself to Spain instead. First stop, Barcelona. My phone exploded. Claire called 14 times in 10 minutes. I declined everyone. Then the text started. Jake, what are you doing? You're supposed to be home. Why are you in Spain? We need to talk about this. I replied once. You had your emergency, I had mine. Mine was realizing what kind of marriage I just signed up for. Her messages got more frantic. Turned out Marcus's emergency was that his mom had a cold. Not dying, just a cold. Claire had driven four hours to comfort him, brought soup, stayed at his place. She called his mom personally, healthy as ever, confused why Claire said she was dying. By day three, I was in Seville. Flamenco shows, incredible food, making friends with other travelers. I posted.

My mom got in the cast member's face. No, absolutely not. Check the back. There has to be more. The cast member kept apologizing, and my sister started crying. The family in front of us was walking away with their kid holding the bucket above his head. My sister took off running, and my mom went right after her. My sister tried to grab the bucket from the kid's hands. The dad pulled his son away, and my sister was screaming, you don't even care about figment! You're just gonna throw that away in a week! My mom shoved the dad so hard he stumbled backwards. Then she lunged at the kid and grabbed the bucket. The kids started wailing. The other mom tried to grab it back, and my mom yanked it away so hard the handle broke. My sister dropped to her knees, sobbing, no, you broke it! Then she looked up at me with your hatred. This is all your fault! If you had run when I told you to, we would have been ahead of them. Disney security showed up and escorted us past hundreds of people who were recording and staring. My sister was crying so hard she could barely walk, and my mom was arguing with security the entire time. We got taken to some office where a supervisor explained that we were banned from all Disney properties. My mom tried to argue that my sister has a medical condition. My daughter Needs this popcorn bucket for her mental health. My dad was sitting in the corner with his head in his hands. My sister was on her phone looking up resale prices for the bucket and crying harder every time she refreshed. The supervisor said we needed to leave immediately and that if we tried to come back, we'd be arrested for trespassing. They walked us out through a back exit. We had dinner reservations that night that cost $400 and we missed it because we spent three hours getting banned and from Disney World. We drove back to the hotel in complete silence except for my sister sobbing in the back seat. My mom kept saying, that family is going to sell that bucket for hundreds of dollars. That's why they wanted it so badly. I checked my phone and my sister had posted a five paragraph rant about Disney discriminating against adults and how I ruined her life by not caring about her passion. My mom had already commented, so proud of you for standing up for yourself, baby girl.

My sister has been obsessed with Disney since we were kids, but it got really bad after college. She's 24 now and has an annual pass even though we live in Ohio, which means my parents fund her monthly trips to Florida. Her room looks like a Disney store exploded in it. She has hundreds of collector pins covering every surface and trying to figment the dragon in the corner. She even tracks limited edition merchandise on a spreadsheet. My parents pay for everything because she claimed she was building a business selling Disney content, but her Instagram only had 200 followers. I wanted nothing to do with this weird Disney worship, but my mom somehow guilt tripped me into going on a family trip with them. The trip was a nightmare from day one. My sister had a full itinerary planned down to the minute, including which bathrooms we were allowed to use. She cried twice before lunch on the first day because a character meet and greet line was too long. My parents just kept apologizing to her and buying her stuff to calm her down. By day three, I was looking at flights home. That's when my sister burst into my room at 6:00am. The pigment bucket drops tomorrow, she said, like she was announcing someone died. She made us sit through a 45 minute presentation About how we were going to obtain the bucket. My mom was taking notes and my dad asked if we needed walkie talkies. When I said it's just a popcorn bucket, my sister's face went red. You don't get me. You never have. My mom squeezed my arm. Please just support her. The next morning, we got to Epcot two hours before it opened. When the gates opened, everyone started power walking toward the store. My sister was practically running and my parents were right behind her. I was walking at a normal pace because I don't run for anyone. When we got in line at the store, it was already wrapped around the building. My sister was on her phone refreshing five different Disney Facebook groups and doing breathing exercises. My mom was next to her saying, you're doing so good, baby. We're almost there. When we finally got close to the front, a cast member came out and started counting heads. She pointed at the family in front of us and said, you guys will get the last one. The family started cheering. The cast member looked at us with this apologetic face. I'm so sorry. We're completely sold out. My sister made this sound I've never heard from a human.

Now she's begging for a comeback after she saw my name as the person who inherited millions of dollars. Diane served me divorce papers on our 10th anniversary. I planned a surprise trip to Italy, had the tickets hidden in my desk drawer, was going to tell her that night at dinner. Instead, I came home to her lawyer sitting in my living room with paperwork. She been sleeping with her personal trainer, Rick for six months, the same trainer I'd hired for her birthday because she said she wanted to get healthier. I paid this man $150 per session twice a week to destroy my marriage. The divorce was brutal. Diane's lawyer painted me as a neglectful workaholic who drove her into another man's arms. Never mind that I worked 70 hours a week running my construction company to pay for her shopping addiction and the house renovations she demanded every year. Judge gave her the house, said she needed stability. The house I'd literally built with my own hands on weekends, pouring the foundation, framing the walls and installing every fixture. She got half my business assets, too. I had to sell my truck, my tools and take out loans to buy out. Her share kept me from going under, but just barely. I moved into a studio apartment above my buddy Tom's garage. Canned soup for dinner most nights, worked 18 hour days trying to rebuild my Adopted parents called occasionally, but I was too ashamed to tell them how bad things were. They'd sacrificed everything to adopt me as a baby, put me through trade school and helped me start my business. I couldn't tell them I'd lost it all. Six months into sleeping on a mattress on the floor, I got a call from someone named William Brenner, said he was an estate attorney from Connecticut. I almost hung up thinking it was a scam. But he mentioned my biological grandparents names, Elizabeth and Robert Hayward, names I'd never heard before. Turns out I've been adopted through a private arrangement. My biological mother was 15 when she had me. Her parents made her give me up. She died in a car accident five years ago, never married, no other kids. Her parents spent decades looking for me, but the adoption records were sealed. They hired investigators, petitioned courts, never gave up. They finally found me three months ago, but both died before they could make contact. Robert from a heart attack, Elizabeth two weeks later from a stroke. They left me everything. Four commercial properties in Hartford are generating $80,000 monthly rent.

The lawyer kept listing assets while I sat in my studio apartment staring at water stains on the ceiling. They'd even left a letter, 20 pages of Elizabeth's handwriting, apologizing for letting me go, explaining they built this wealth hoping to find me, that everything they did was with the dream of one day giving it to their grandson. They updated their will every year for 35 years, always leaving everything to me, using the only name they had from the adoption papers. Two weeks after the lawyer's call, I was signing paperwork in Connecticut when my phone started blowing up. Diane had seen my name in the Hartford newspaper story about the Hayward estate. Suddenly, she was texting about how she missed me, made a terrible mistake. Rick meant nothing. I didn't respond. Then came the calls from her mother, sister, our old mutual friends, all saying I should consider forgiveness. Still didn't respond. A month later, after I'd moved into a decent apartment and restarted my business properly, Diane showed up at my office. But she wasn't alone. Rick was with her, standing behind her like a bodyguard. They were getting married next month but were short on funds. The house needed repairs I'd apparently never finished properly. Could I help out for old time's sake? After all, I could afford it now. The audacity was breathtaking. This woman who'd taken my house. My business, my dignity was now asking for handouts with her affair partner right there. Rick even chimed in, said it would be the mature thing to do, that we were all adults who could move past petty resentments. Petty resentments he called destroying my life petty. I looked at them standing in the office I'd rebuilt from nothing in the business sheet nearly destroyed, asking for my dead grandparents money. My biological grandparents who'd spent 35 years searching for me, built an empire hoping to find their grandson whose fortune Diane thought she could just request, like borrowing a cup of sugar. I stood up, walked to the door and opened it. Get out. If you contact me again, my lawyer will handle it. His name is William Brenner. You might remember lawyers. Diane, you certainly paid yours enough of my money. They left without another word. Last I heard, they had to cancel their wedding venue because they couldn't afford the deposit.

Get upstairs now! Lipp had been having strange dreams lately. He knew he couldn't keep going like that. After all, he was only in his 20s, still full of energy. So he went to a diner and approached a waitress. He told her what he was thinking. But then Sarah came over. The girl took one look at Sarah and then rejected Lipp. And I would love to jump your bones, cause Sierra's my girl. But we're friends. It'd still be weird. After being rejected, Lipp went to his job at the garage. He shared his dreams with a coworker. In this dream, my entire house is filled with all these naked models, right? But every time I go and try to touch some tits, poof! Now she disappears. But their talk got way too explicit, and it really ticked Eddie off. You're gonna fix that bike or fuck it. Jesus Christ, already? That night, Lipp managed to score a date with a girl. At first, things went great. Then the girl suggested having a few drinks. But Lipp wasn't having it. He was trying to stay sober. While she went to order the drinks, he slipped out and left. The next day, Brad came to Lipp with some happy news. He was going to be a dad. But Lipp started rambling about what happened the night before. And Eddie couldn't take it anymore. He's been yapping about ass non stop. You know, I'm almost 10 months clean. He's gonna make me backslide. When the two of them started arguing, Brad quickly bailed. I need some fucking pussy. Get upstairs now! Hearing Eddie's words, lick was stunned. After

Then he opened a bucket of pig fat. The woman thought Jack was up to something kinky, but instead, he started covering her with the pig fat. He even took out a scraper. The woman instantly got upset and tried to leave. But as she turned around, Jack knocked her out cold. Next, he cut off her hair. Then Jack wrapped her tightly in the pig fat soaked cloth. Once the fat had fully absorbed her scent, he carefully scraped off the grease, then distilled the world's one of a kind perfume. Jack grew up in an orphanage and later worked at a leather factory. Because of his excellent work, his boss took him to the city to broaden his horizons. The variety of smells in the city deeply fascinated him. Suddenly, a unique fragrance caught his attention. It was coming from the fruit vendor he had passed earlier. Jack couldn't help himself. He approached her, grabbed her hand and sniffed it deeply. The woman, terrified, immediately ran away. But Jack wasn't ready to let go. He followed her scent all the way to a secluded alley. Afraid of being caught, Jack pressed his hand over her mouth. It wasn't until later that he realized his mistake. To preserve the woman's scent, Jack began studying the art of perfume making.

Today we are talking about the cases of Cynthia Coffman, Kerry Dalton, and Veronica Gonzales. Part2 I #deathrow #execution #women #womenondeathrow #news #truecrime #crime #california","california,women,crime,deathrow,news,truecrime,execution,womenondeathrow","Carrie was the only one who did not cooperate with the detectives and decided to go to trial. And this is where she was found guilty of Irene's murder and the jury actually recommended the death sentence. She is currently 65 years old and is serving her death sentence at the Central California Women's Facility. And because she's in California, I don't think we will ever see her be executed. The last person I wanna talk about today is 55 year old Veronica Gonzales who has been serving a death sentence in California for the last 27 years. She was sentenced to death for the absolutely horrific torture and murder of her 4 year old niece Jenny Rohas. When I say absolutely horrific, some of the details of what they did to this little girl are by far the worst things that I have ever, ever read. I'm not going to go into exact details of what they did to her, not only because it's extremely graphic, but also because I don't even think there's time to talk about everything that they did to this girl. In 1995, four year old Jenny Rohas began living with her aunt and uncle Veronica and Ivan Gonzales. And this was after her mother had lost custody of her. Six other children also lived in this home with them. And the home was in absolutely deplorable conditions. There were cockroaches everywhere. There was no food in the house. None of the children had beds And all of the children had lice. While Jenny was living there, Veronica and Ivan began very brutally torturing and abusing her. She was frequently beaten, strangled, handcuffed and starved. They would burn her with a blow dryer or curling iron, burn her with boiling hot water, handcuff her and force her to sleep in a box. Just absolutely horrific, horrific things. On July 21st of 1995, they both forcefully submerged Jenny into a bathtub full of scalding hot water. Water temperature was 156 degrees Fahrenheit and was so extremely hot that it peeled the skin and the toenails off of the lower half of her body. She had severe burns to over 50% of her body to the point where several parts of her body was missing skin and she was even missing hair from her head. And I really want you to think about what I just said because after this happened, Veronica and Ivan let her sit there and suffer for six hours until she eventually stopped breathing and she died. When Jenny was brought to the hospital, they discovered that she had injuries to every single part of her body and they were in various stages of healing. So she had been abused for a while. There were so many injuries to this little 4 year old's body that it took up 10 pages of the court documents to just describe her injuries. Veronica and Ivan were immediately arrested following Jenny's death and they both went to Trial where they were found guilty of her murder and they were both sentenced to death. Ivan is currently 58 years old and is serving his death sentence at the California State Prison. Veronica is currently 55 years old and is serving her death sentence at the Central California Women's Facility and because she's in California I don't think we will ever see her be executed. I'm going to go ahead and end it there for time sake but please let me know if you guys want me to keep this series going and go over some more of the women on this list. Also please let me know if you guys like how I'm currently doing this. Right now I'm doing 3 women at a time because I like to give a little bit of details on the case but if you'd rather see a much more quicker breakdown so that I can cover more women in a video please let me know and I can try to change it up. But anyways, thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video.

Today we are talking about the cases of Cynthia Coffman, Kerry Dalton, and Veronica Gonzales. Part1 I #deathrow #execution #women #womenondeathrow #news #truecrime #crime #california","california,women,crime,deathrow,news,truecrime,execution,womenondeathrow","Did you know there are currently 2,100 men on death row but only 48 women? Let's do another video where we talk about some of these women that are on death row and what exactly they did to get there. Really quickly before I begin, all three of the women I'm talking about today are from California. And death row in California has been dismantled. So that means that all three of these women are still serving a death sentence. However, they are no longer on death row and they're just in general population in prison. The first person I want to talk about today is 63 year old Cynthia Kaufman who has been serving a death sentence in California for the last 35 years. And she was actually the very first woman to receive the death penalty in California since it was reinstated back in 1977. She was sentenced to death after her and her boyfriend kidnapped and murdered four different women over the span of two months back in 1986. Cynthia began dating a man who had just been released from jail by the name of James Marlowe. Quickly after they began dating, they began using drugs, they got married and then they started to commit very violent crimes together. From October to November of 1986, they kidnapped and murdered four different women. On October 11th of 1986, they killed 32 year old Sandra Neary and on October 28th they killed 35 year old Pamela Simmons. Then on November 7th they Killed 20 year old Corina Novis and on November 12 they killed 19 year old Lionel Murray. They were both arrested just two days after killing Lynell. And when Cynthia was brought in for questioning, she immediately confessed to everything. At first she tried to tell police that James was abusing her and she was too scared to leave him and that she did not participate in the murders of the four women. But while she was in prison, she ended up confessing to her cellmate that she was absolutely in love with James and she did participate with all of the murders. In 1989 and 1990, Cynthia and James both went to trial where they were both found guilty of the murders of all four women and they were both sentenced to death. James is currently 68 years old and is serving his death sentence at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility. Cynthia is currently 63 years old and is serving her death sentence at the Central California Women's Facility. And because she's in California, I don't think we will ever see her be executed. The next person on the list is 65 year old Carrie Dalton who has been serving a death sentence in California for the last 30 years. She was sentenced to death for the 1988 torture and murder of 23 year old Irene Melanie May. And still to this day Irene's body has never been found. On June 26 of 1988, Carrie and two other People, Cheryl Baker and Mark Tompkins were all together in a house with Irene. At some point, Carrie decided that Irene was a snitch and she eventually convinced both Mark and Cheryl that they all needed to kill her. Carrie decided that the best way to do this was to fill two syringes full of battery acid and then to inject Irene with those syringes. But when Irene wasn't immediately dying, they then began to be hit her over the head with a cast iron skillet and then they stabbed her several times. They then took her body and disposed of it. No one knows exactly how or what happened. And still to this day, her body has never been found. Both Mark and Cheryl cooperated with the detectives and told them everything that happened. And Mark Tomkins ended up pleading guilty to first degree murder and was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Cheryl Baker pled guilty to second degree murder and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. And I believe by now both of them have been released.

Pero cuando el Machi realmente se quedó atascado en su garganta, gampachi empezó a dudar. Intentó levantarse luchando, pero tropezó con la mesa y se desmayó. Justo entonces, el alma de gampachi flotó fuera de su cuerpo. Al darse cuenta de que su cuerpo todavía respiraba, gampachi salió volando rápidamente. Quería encontrar a alguien que lo salvara, pero nadie en la calle podía verlo. Justo cuando gampachi gritaba desesperado pidiendo ayuda, de repente vio a un chico con color. Esto le dio esperanza, y al confirmar que ichiro podía verlo, gampachi agarró la bicicleta de ichiro y se la llevó corriendo a casa. En el camino, gampachi le dijo a ichiro que estaba a punto de ahogarse. En pánico, ichiro abrió la puerta y vio a gampachi desmayado sobre la mesa. Ichiro levantó rápidamente el cuerpo de gampachi, pero por más que intentara, no pudo abrirle la boca. Entonces fue por detrás de gampachi. Ichiro planeó unir fuerzas con Niro para sacar ese trozo de Machi. Mientras tanto, el alma de gampachi solo pudo animarlos ansiosamente desde un lado, pero Niro era solo un perrito. Por más que se esforzara, no alcanzaba el Machi. Justo cuando gampachi se sintió sin esperanzas, ichiro levantó el cuerpo. Como ichiro solo tenía 8 años, tenía suficiente fuerza y para asombro de gampachi, Niro, ichiro y gampachi cayeron juntos. Cuando ichiro luchó por ponerse en pie y quiso buscar a un adulto para pedir Ayuda. Gampachi lo detuvo. No quería que nadie lo hubiera hecho un desastre, pero ichiro insistió en salir por ayuda. Mientras discutían, Niro pareció notar algo. Algo parecía haber salido de la boca de gampachi. Gampachi pensó que era el Machi atascado en su garganta y que le dijo a ichiro que tirara con todas sus fuerzas. Pero cuando ichiro lo sacó, descubrió que en realidad era la lengua de gampachi. Gampachi se quedó totalmente en shock. Por suerte, el Machi salió junto con la lengua de gampachi. Después de que ichiro sacó el Machi, gampachi regresó inmediatamente a su cuerpo. Sin embargo, por haber estado tanto tiempo sin oxígeno, el alma de gampachi volvió a flotar fuera de él rápidamente. Ver la muerte de un humano por primera vez puso a ichiro muy triste. Eso hizo que gampachi se sintiera algo culpable, así que lo consoló pacientemente. Pronto, ichiro volvió a la normalidad, pero justo cuando ichiro estaba a punto de irse, gampachi lo detuvo otra vez. Quería que ichiro lo dejara ir con algo de dignidad, así que ichiro y Niro arrastraron el cuerpo de gampachi hasta el dormitorio juntos y le ordenaron la habitación con cuidado. Realmente, gampachi les amenazó para que no le contaran a nadie el bochornoso hecho de que se había atragantado hasta la muerte con un Machi. De lo contrario, gampachi se convertiría en fantasma y vendría a buscar a ichiro todas las noches

To keep its owner from waking up and killing it, the rooster paints on the window to make the owner think it's still night time. It turns out that the morning before, when the rooster crowed, it saw the farmer sharpening an axe. At first, it thought this was just normal maintenance. But when it saw the farmer practicing chopping motions, it realised the danger. While the farmer went inside to rest, the rooster used its claws to drag the axe to the vegetable garden. Then it dug a hole and buried the axe, thought this would keep it safe. However, when the farmer watered the plants, the axe popped up from the soil. The farmer thought a new axe had grown in the ground, so he brought it back to the house. The desperate rooster spent all night thinking of solutions. The next day, while the owner was out, the rooster grabbed the axe to defend itself. But before it could act, it noticed a newspaper on the ground. That day was duck hunting season. Hunters would be out shooting ducks. The rooster came up with a crazy idea. It ran to the barn and stuck a toy duck on a hat as a gift for its owner. Once the farmer entered the cornfield, the rooster whistled loudly. Little did it know, this sounded like a duck call. As a result, it got all its feathers. Shut off. The rooster, then took a hand grenade, painted it white, pulled the pin, and placed it in the nest. The owner picked up this egg and shook it, thinking it would hatch into a chick. He had the rooster incubated. By the time the rooster tried to escape, it was too late. Soon, the owner approached with the axe. Rooster ran for its life and crashed headfirst into a tree. When it finally regained consciousness, it started writing its will. But surprisingly, the axe wasn't meant for it. The owner was chopping the tree behind it. The rooster breathed a sigh of relief. Just as it was celebrating with a dance, the tree fell right on its head. To help itself recover faster, the rooster started cooking itself. After drinking the chicken soup, it would be completely healed.

She pointed to a more expensive set. As the staff turned away, she swapped back the fake and fled. Two police officers tracked her down and finally apprehended her. She tried to escape again while they were talking, but an officer grabbed her clothes. The staff member was distracted by the beauty. One officer seized the moment to swap the items. Amid the staff's gratitude, they departed. He produced the genuine necklace and all three burst into laughter. Yes, they were a high IQ fraud ring dedicated to punishing criminals who evaded justice. She targeted a wealthy gang boss for her next strike. As they collided, she snatched his wallet. Amidst his apologies, she politely turned away and handed the wallet to her accomplice. But within 10 minutes, the tycoon tracked her down. He emptied her bag's contents, yet his wallet remained missing. She removed her coat. Either search me or apologize. He turned away just as a waiter picked up and returned his wallet. He looked back. She was already in tears, crouched on the floor, face in her hands. He quickly helped her gather her purse, apologizing profusely. She stood, snatched her bag and turned to leave, a faint smile playing on her lips. The prey was hooked. The tycoon turned in his own bar to find her. He rose to apologize, offering drinks as reparation. She deliberately leaned close to take a drink, stealing his room key. In the process, after clinking glasses, he downed his shot in one gulp. She promptly poured hers out, fainting a headache from overindulgence. Then she dashed to the restroom, handing the key to her accomplice. Her accomplice sneaked into the tycoon's room to install 10 pinhole cameras. But an unexpected turn. The tycoon got up to return to his room. In a panic, she grabbed his hand and shed tears. Then she genuinely got herself drunk and began babbling incoherently at him. The tycoon found himself drawn to this heartbroken beauty. After installing the cameras, the accomplice fled the room and returned the key card to the bar. Spotting the accomplice, she wrapped her arms around the tycoon's head. The accomplice successfully slipped the key card back into the tycoon's jacket. Seeing the accomplice retreat safely, she collapsed into the tycoon's arms. She awoke in his presidential suite. When the tycoon opened the door, she quickly collapsed, fainting sleep. He closed the door and left to take a shower. She rose and went to the living room, retrieving the tycoon's phone to implant malware. Her accomplice remotely manipulated the device, successfully transferring the gang's illicit funds. Now they had stolen $100 million from both the criminal syndicate and corrupt officials.

Just when we thought we would die out there, a ship suddenly appeared in the distance. We waved our arms and shouted for help, trying to get their attention, but the noise of the waves drowned everything. In the end, it didn't work. We were completely hopeless. So we held on to each other tightly. Night fell, then heavy rain poured down. We lifted our heads and drank as much as we could. The exhaustion from the day quickly pulled us into sleep. When I opened my eyes, the woman next to me was gone. I looked around. The sea was empty. With no choice left, I started swimming forward. Then I heard movement in the water. A shark appeared not far away. It came straight at me. Somehow, I escaped its first attack. I was overjoyed, but then I saw blood dripping from my arm. At any moment, that blood could bring the shark back. I spotted a reef in the distance and decided to risk it all. I pulled off my life jacket, smeared blood on it and tossed it in the other direction. Then I swam hard toward the reef. The life jacket bought me some time, but the shark was still fast. At the last moment, I climbed onto the reef. That's when I realised my leg was also hurt. I tore my jacket to wrap it up, then collapsed into sleep. When I woke again, the tide had risen. The reef was almost gone. Just when I thought the sea would take me, a ship was speeding straight toward me.

Well, one of the first people to testify against him was his ex partner, Officer Dawson Farley, who was with him that day. He said there wasn't one point that night that he was afraid of Sonya Massey, and in fact, the only person he was afraid of that night was his partner, Sean Grayson. When they played the body cam footage for the jury to see, Sean Grayson covered his ears and looked down when they played the part where he fired three times at Sonya, taking her life. If you're unfamiliar with this case, on July 6th of 2024, Sonya Massey called police to her home in Springfield, Illinois because she thought that there was an intruder outside of her house. After entering, Sean Grayson notices there's a pot of boiling water on the stove, so he tells Sonya to go take it off. And as she's taking it off, they're joking back and forth, and Sonya says, I'll rebuke you in the name of Jesus. That's when Sean Grayson says, you better effing not! I swear to god, I'll shoot you in your effing face! Sonya apologizes and ducks beneath the counter, but regardless, Grayson fires three times, hitting her once in the head. He then prevents his partner from getting medical aid because he says she's already done. Turns out Sean Grayson had a history of misconduct, but he was still allowed to be on the field. Rest in peace to Sonya. Prayers for her justice. Let me know what you guys think, and as anything comes out, I'll keep you guys updated.

Around 9:30 yesterday morning, police responded to a call from a young boy who said that everyone in his home was dead. Officers described it as nothing short of a massacre, with Jonathan shooting Lindsay, Ethan, Dylan and Lucas, but leaving his ten year old unharmed. Now, according to police, sometime overnight, Jonathan and Lindsay became involved in an altercation. Jonathan then, quote, armed himself with a gun, and he shot her several times. At that point, he reportedly started going through the house and systematically killing their children. There was actually just one child found in his bed, with investigators saying that they were hunted down and killed. Now, aside from that, we know investigators didn't find any signs of a struggle and that ultimately they found two bodies upstairs and two bodies downstairs. They say that why the young, the question wasn't killed remains a mystery, and that he was released to other family members at the scene. There were also no previous calls to the residents or reports of domestic violence. And it seems like everyone is wondering what happened. Lindsay Candy was known to be a wonderful mother, and 18 year old Dylan just graduated from the local high school last year.

Adult Protective Services soon got involved. Turned out grandma had been transferring $1,200 every month for three years labeled Bill help. Zero receipts, no repayment. Court day came. My parents sat across from us looking miserable. Tyler looked bored. I presented everything, the footage, the note, the bank records. The judge reviewed it all. Then he looked at my parents. You dumped your 75 year old mother on a sidewalk before dawn. You abandoned her. Mom tried crying. We just wanted what was best for may. The judge cut her off. You've been draining this woman's fixed income for over 30 months. When she was no longer convenient, you discarded her. Sat back. Defendants are found guilty of elder abandonment and financial misconduct, 3 thousand dollar fine and 12 months probation. My dad stood up, pointed at grandma. No real mother would let her son be dragged into court. Grandma stood. I raised a man who's standing next to me. You raised yourself into a corner. That night, grandma pulled out an envelope. I didn't tell anyone because I wanted to see how they treat me when I had nothing. Inside were legal documents, property deeds, account summaries. Total net worth $51 million. I sold land. My sister left me. That restaurant I worked at, I owned part of it. Silent share. All under my Maiden name. Your father never knew. She handed over more papers. You're now the legal owners. Of a coastal property in Monterey, 50 rooms. It's yours. We sat there stunned. Two weeks later, the doorbell rang. My mom holding a pie behind her dad and Tyler. We've been thinking about you, mom said, smiling. We want to reconnect. Tyler held up a photo album. We brought pictures. Grandma stepped forward. You didn't care when I was freezing on a sidewalk, but now you want to reconnect, he smiled. You can keep the pie, but the door stays closed. I shut it clean. Monday morning, I filed a restraining order. Two months later, Tyler got kicked out by my parents after racking up debt and punching a cabinet. My parents moved two towns over. Words spread about the court case. They hosted a family gathering once. Three people showed up. None stayed long. Grandma's still with us. You don't need blood to define family. You just need people who show up when it counts.

A year later, they came back begging, but she wasn't the same burden anymore. I woke up to my neighbor calling. Charles, your grandma sitting outside your gate. I blinked. Wait, what? Been there 20 minutes? Two bags. She hasn't moved. I scrambled outside with my wife, Violet. Grandma, May 75, sat on freezing concrete at 5:30 a. M. Two busted suitcases beside her. One had a folded note shoved through the handle. She wasn't crying or yelling, just staring at the ground, hands shaking, face pale. We rushed her inside, wrapped her in blankets, cranked the heat. She still hadn't spoken. I opened the note. We figured this was best. Please understand. That was it. No names, no explanation. I checked security footage. 5:00am, my dad's SUV pulled up. He got out, open the back seat. Mom helped grandma out. They placed the bags next to her and drove off. No hugs, no knocking, just gone. I called them both a dozen times. No answer. Straight to voicemail. Finally, grandma spoke, voice quiet. Last night your dad packed my things, said Tyler and Olivia were moving in. The house was too crowded. Tyler, my golden boy brother, always got everything handed to him. They just left you in the cold. She looked away. He said it wouldn't be forever. Next day, we drove to their house. Tyler stood Outside with a moving truck, laughing with his wife, Olivia. When he saw us, his smile died. My parents sat inside like nothing happened. You dumped her at my gate like garbage, I said. Dad didn't even blink. She's staying with you now, isn't she? What's the problem? The problem is you left her outside in 38 degree weather at 5:30 in the morning. Mom set her coffee down dramatically. We had no choice. Charles, Taylor and Olivia just had a baby. They needed stability. Your grandma was too much TV, too loud, forgetting things. Tyler shrugged. Look, she wasn't happy here anyway. I stared at him. She gave up her retirement to help raise us. You paid your college deposit when dad couldn't afford it. He rolled his eyes. That doesn't mean she gets to control the house. We left that afternoon. I filed an elder abandonment report. Show the detective the security footage, the note, my unanswered calls, everything. This isn't just abandonment, he said.

For three months, Garrett would accidentally grab my food deliveries. Always had some excuse ready. Oh, I thought it was mine. I'll Venmo you later. Spoiler alert he never did. It started small. My Chipotle bowl disappeared one Tuesday. Found Garrett eating it while gaming. Dude, I was starving and thought you ordered for both of us. Then my Friday night pizza. Gone. Sorry, man. Driver said it was for the apartment. I'll split the cost by month two. He wasn't even trying to hide it. I'd come home to find empty containers in his room. Thai food, Indian, Mexican, Chinese. If it showed up at our door, Garrett claimed it. Last week was the breaking point. Ordered my usual pad Thai from Bangkok Garden. $30 with tip. Extra spicy. Just how I like it. Long day at work, looking forward to unwinding with my comfort food. Walked into the living room to find Garrett scarfing down my dinner while binge watching the office. Dude, this was clearly labeled with my name and apartment number. Sorry, man. I was so hungry after the gym. I'll pay you back tomorrow. Promise. I'd heard that promise 17 times, never saw a penny. That was the final straw. I started planning. See, Garrett has this huge work presentation on Friday. He's been stressed about it for weeks, practicing his pitch in the mirror, printing presentation packets at Kinko's. His entire promotion to senior account manager depends on impressing the new VP. Helen Rodriguez. Been talking about it non stop. If I nail this presentation, I'm finally moving up. If I blow it, I'm stuck doing data entry forever. So Tuesday evening, I placed a very special order called Milano's Premium Catering. The most expensive place in town. The kind that caters law firm partners, meetings and country club events. I'd like to order a full executive spread for Garrett Mitchell's big promotion Celebration. I told them tomorrow at 11 a m. Sushi Platters, Gourmet.

Ava opened her eyes in the hospital bed after the car accident and smiled at me drowsily. But then she looked confused. Then fear overtook her. Why are you in my room? I reached for her hand, but she jerked away. Ava, I'm Silas, your husband. She shook her head violently. I'm not married. I'd remember being married. Held up my left hand, showing the ring she'd slipped on five years ago while crying happy tears. We've been together seven years, married for five. Her eyes went wide with panic. You're lying. This is insane. The doctors explained the amnesia while Ava stared at her own wedding ring like it might bite her. For three days I watched my wife treat me like a well meaning stranger. She was polite, but kept her distance. Her parents showed her our wedding album. You were so happy, her mother kept saying. Ava studied the photos clinically. She looks happy, she'd say. Like a bride with someone else entirely. At night, I'd go set up a planetarium. The place where we first fell in love. I arranged hundreds of photos and videos of her life before the accident, our life together. I truly believe that if she fell in love with me once, she could do it again. The drive to the planetarium felt like heading to my own execution. Ava sat pressed against the passenger door. Can You at least tell me why we're going to a planetarium, she asked. Because you once told me that you knew you'd marry me under these exact stars. She went quiet. That's either really romantic or really presumptuous. I couldn't tell if she was joking. Inside, I LED her to the center, where I recreated our first date exact, exactly. Same blankets, same spot, even the same brand of chocolate she'd brought to share. Sit here and look up, I said. Eva lowered herself carefully, still treating me like a stranger. Then the dome exploded with light. Her college graduation photo appeared first, spreading across the ceiling. That's me! She gasped. More photos bloomed like flowers around it. This is every moment that LED to us, I said. The photos changed to the bookstore where she'd worked.

Mister Peterson, I've been noticing some concerning behavior in class. I. Concerning behavior? I literally just sit there and calculate numbers. She points at me. He's been using advanced technology to gain unfair advantages over students following traditional methods. Advanced technology? It's a twelve dollar calculator from Walmart. Mr. Peterson looks confused. You mean his calculator? Yes. While we're struggling with mental math like you intended, he's just pressing buttons and getting perfect answers. Lady, that's literally what calculators are for. It's creating an unequal learning environment. Madison can. Some students don't have access to these devices. The school literally sells the same calculator in the student store for $15. Mr. Peterson scratches his Head. Well, calculators aren't technically prohibited, but they should be. It's academic dishonesty disguised as convenience. Academic dishonesty for using a tool designed specifically for math? I think we should investigate his methods, Madison says, eyeing my backpack like it contains state secrets. Mr. Peterson, clearly uncomfortable with Madison's intensity, agrees to look into it. The next day, I get called to the principal's office during lunch. Principal Williams sits me down like I'm about to confess to selling test answers.

At the funeral, Tyler sat in the back, didn't speak, left before the reception. Dad pulled me aside. She talked about you constantly those last months. Said you reminded her of her father. Kind, steady. I wore Mom's ring on a chain around my neck. And at the reception when someone asked.

The room laughed. A week later, when our mom landed in the hospital, I was the only one who showed up and the only one she asked for. Growing up, Tyler was the golden child, straight A's, med school, married his college sweetheart, three kids, big house in the suburbs, club membership. I was just the other one, the guy who chose teaching over money, who bought a modest townhouse. Instead of keeping up appearances at family dinners, mom would brag about Tyler's latest achievement, his new car, his promotion, his kid, it's private school. I'd sit there nodding, smiling. My 40th birthday fell on a Saturday. My wife Claire threw a small dinner, both our families. I'd spent all afternoon making tiramisu from scratch, Mom's old recipe, the one she used to make for special occasions. Tyler took one look and smirked. Look at that. Nate finally did something useful. The table erupted in laughter. Dad chuckled. Tyler's wife grinned. Even my own kids giggled. Claire's smile was tight. I set the dessert down, forced to laugh. Yeah, that's me, Mister Useful. I cut everyone a slice, ate mine in silence, left early, blamed a headache. Claire squeezed my hand in the car. He's an ass family, I said. A week later, my phone rang at 2:00am. Dad's voice was shaking. Your mom collapsed at Mercy, General. I threw on clothes, grabbed my keys. The hospital was 35 minutes away. I made it in 22. Dad was in the waiting room, pale, hands trembling. Called him, he's coming. I sat with dad until 4:00am. Finally, a doctor came out. She's stable. You can see her. Mom looked small in that bed, tubes everywhere, monitors beeping. Her eyes opened. When I walked in, Nate, she whispered. I took her hand. I'm here, mom. Don't leave. I won't. Tyler showed up at 8:00am, hair perfect, Starbucks cup in hand. Traffic, he said, not looking at me. Mom was awake by then, groggy but alert. She looked past Tyler. Squeeze my hand tighter. Where were you, she asked him. Tyler blinked. I'm here now. Mom had to arrange coverage at the practice. She pulled her hand from his kids to get ready for school. So does he, mom said quietly. He was just here. Tyler's jaw tightened. He stayed for 20 minutes, then left. I stayed for three days, sleeping in the chair beside her bed, bringing dad coffee, talking to doctors.

This shocked Flanders deeply. Noticing Flanders pale face, the doctor tried to open the window to get some fresh air. However, he accidentally fell down. Afraid of the pain, the doctor gave himself an anesthetic injection to eye. In the end, his death pose was exactly the same as what Flanders had foreseen on his way home, Flanders saw an old man hanging from a power line. If Flanders took the initiative to step forward to catch him, but he immediately saw a vision of the old man being killed by a crocodile. If Flanders was stunned, he let go of his hands and the old man fell into the sewer. He was indeed killed by a crocodile. Flanders felt confused that he told Homer about his superpower. Homer asked Flanders to predict how he would die if Flanders discovered that Homer would be shot to death and the killer was himself. If Flanders didn't dare to tell Homer what he had seen, Flanders plan to move away. Before leaving, he told Lisa about this matter, but Homer accidentally overheard everything that he didn't think Flanders would kill anyone. Homer even took a police officer's gun to threaten Flanders. I'm so scared that Flanders is pointing a gun at me. Flanders turned around and threw the gun into a shredder. He was glad that he had changed the outcome of killing Homer, that he Hugged Homer only to find that Homer would trigger a nuclear explosion that would destroy the earth. Homer was just about to go to work. Flanders followed him to the nuclear power plant telling Homer not to press the self destruct button. Press the destruct button. Homer had no choice but to listen to Flanders. Seeing this, Flanders grabbed the security guards gun. The bullet pierced through Homer's body in an instant. Dot Flanders prediction came true again. Well, you stupid son of a.

But what the prince didn't realize was that the man had been hiding his true strength all along. Back at the Magic Academy, he was known as the strongest defensive mage, not only mastering all the elemental magics, but also regarded as the most talented mage since the Academy's founding. After becoming a court mage, he focused on support magic to help the ambitious prince level up more efficiently. Yet the prince never noticed. He thought a commoner who only used support magic wasn't worthy of teaming up with him. Despite being expelled, the man didn't give up. After all, his own master had also been a court mage who was justly exiled. His goal was to challenge the kingdom's class system. The next day, he tried to meet with the king, explaining that the prince's team wasn't strong enough to tackle the 30th floor of the dungeon, which was extremely dangerous. But because of his commoner status, he couldn't even enter the castle gates. A mage from the prince's team came over to mock him, scoffing at the rumor that he had once broken the record for the 37th floor of the abyss to reach the 69th floor. To the mage, it sounded like nothing more than boastful nonsense. Unable to enter, the man tried to Hand his dungeon guide directly to the king. But the mage dismissed it, tearing the guide into pieces and ordering the guards to throw him out face. With such a humiliating outcome, he could only sign and prepare to leave the capital. Unexpectedly, he ran into a friend from his academy days. Red hair, upon hearing what had happened, immediately invited him to join his team. With nothing better to do, the man agreed. Together, they took a carriage to the dungeon city of Thistle, where the first step was registering him as an adventurer. Their target was the 52nd floor of the dungeon. But trouble came immediately. To enter floors above the 30th, one needed a special task only available to guild members with at least two and a half years of membership. Red hair was frustrated. There was no way to wait that long. Complaining would do no good. We suggested exploring the lower floors first. The man agreed it was a good chance to warm up. Having spent every day in the princess team casting support magic, he finally had a chance to show his offensive power. The two worked seamlessly, and the monsters in the shallow floors were no match. But oddly, instead of speeding through, the number of monsters kept increasing. Sensing something wrong, the man prepared to unleash his long, unused defensive magic. Red hair cooperated, casting a defensive barrier to protect the area. The man's lightning spell struck instantly, wiping out all the Red flying insects on the map. Just as he thought the battle was over, a giant abissal worm burst from underground and bit red hair. The man immediately understood the anomaly on this floor was caused by this creature. Were such a giant monster he was in his element. The massive worm was instantly killed by his sacrificial heavy strike, while red hair, as the Academy's top support mage, had long since cast a protective barrier around himself. The man's spell reminded him of their Academy days when they reached the 68th floor of the dungeon and were completely helpless against the boss, only to have him arrive late and instantly obliterated with a full element magic spell. Now that he had returned to the team, their combined strength meant they could break records once again.
