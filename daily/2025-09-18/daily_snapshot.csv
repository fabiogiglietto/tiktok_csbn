But you said we had to do it with the lights off, so I never got to see it. Yeah, just know it is what you wanted. What is that supposed to mean? Just tell me how big it is. Are you sure? Yes, tell me. Well, it is really three inches. Three? Stop lying to me. That was way bigger than three. I know, cause I didn't use it. What are you talking about? You said you wanted it to be extremely large and very dark. But I'm extremely light and very small. So I came up with a solution. What was your solution? I turn the lights off and use my fist. Huh? What? Honestly, come back. You hit all of the right spots and there are no pregnancy scares with a fist. So you don't think I should be embarrassed? I and you should definitely feel embarrassed. Like, I could not imagine having to deal with only three inches. But that fisted wonders. I know. I lost my whole arm in there. You used your whole arm? Yeah, you kept saying deeper and it just kept going. So that is why I felt it in my lungs all the way from my cat. Yeah, but whatever you used, it got the job done. Can I Come clean actually. What do you mean come clean? I thought you already did when you said you had three inches and just used your fist. It was a joke. I turned off the lights cause I was just too drunk and didn't want to see any lights. But I actually did use Mr. Johnson. That was your snake? There is no chance. One more thing. What could it be now? You didn't pull out. Actually. Yes. What? You try to pull out on time when it is like two foot long. Fair. I'm having a kid though. What? Why?

I painted it. I was standing in front of my largest piece at the gallery opening, champagne in hand, when a man in an expensive suit approached and started explaining my own painting to me. He had no idea I was the artist because the placard said Riley Turner, who he clearly assumed was a man since he kept talking about his brilliant technique. This guy Robert looked me up and down and said, you seem young to be at an opening like this. Let me guess, looking for a rich boyfriend? Smart girl. Lots of wealthy men here. He gestured at my painting like he owned it. See, what Riley is doing here requires years of training to appreciate. You probably just think the colours are pretty. The average woman just sees decoration. I took a sip of champagne and said, interesting perspective, which I guess he took as encouragement. Robert moved closer to the painting, physically stepping in front of me, and continued his lecture. A girl like you probably thinks this is just nice to look at, but there's actual intelligence behind it. The artist is obviously a man, because women simply don't have this kind of technical mastery. Female painters do. Flowers and feelings. This has real intellectual depth. It's biological, really. Men are just more capable of this level of abstraction. When I mentioned I was familiar with the Artist's work. Robert laughed and patted my shoulder. Following him on Instagram to look at the Pretty Pictures doesn't count as being familiar with Art, Sweetheart. You probably think you're cultured because you went to that Van Gogh light show. Real knowledge comes from decades of study, not whatever you Learned from TikTok. Robert decided to test me. Rapid firing questions. Who's Basquiat? What's Kiara Scuro? Name three Renaissance painters besides da Vinci. When I started to answer, he cut me off. Wrong. See, this is why galleries shouldn't have open events. You probably googled some terms before coming here to impress men, but Riley here is working in a tradition you couldn't possibly understand without a proper education. Not community college, sweetie. Real universities. He returned to my painting, now explaining it louder to raw crowd. What Riley has achieved here would cost probably 100,000 in education to even attempt. The materials alone cost more than you'd make in a month at whatever retail job you have. He looked at my outfit with disgust. Target clearance rack, right? Someone who shops there couldn't possibly grasp the investment in this piece. He probably spent more on one brush than your entire outfit. When I suggested the artist might be self taught, Robert sneered at me. Is that how you Learned about art? Painting parties? Robert grabbed my wrist to me to another angle, his grip too tight. You're too stupid to even stand in the right spot. Riley intended for This. To be viewed from exactly here, your ignorance is actually disrespectful to his work. He kept his hand on my wrist while explaining though. Honestly, explaining this to you is like teaching calculus to a toddler. You lack the basic foundation to understand any of it. He noticed me trying to pull away and squeeze harder. What am I keeping you from taking selfies? This is exactly why serious collectors hate these events. Girls like you come for the free alcohol and to hunt for sugar daddies. You're polluting the space where real art appreciation happens. He waved at a security guard. She's drunk. And her

Said I'd end up cleaning toilets for people like him, not knowing his dad worked for my mom. I was the quiet kid in eighth grade whose mom always said to keep a low profile at school. She dropped me off a block away every morning before heading to her office, and I knew not to mention that she meant the executive suite of the biggest company in town. Bruce's dad worked there, too, always bragging about being a regional sales manager. Bruce had no idea my mom was the one who signed his dad's paychecks, though. And because of that, Bruce made me the target of his bullying. Everything started on a Tuesday morning in early October when Bruce knocked my books out of my hands in the main hallway while I knelt down to gather my scattered papers. He stood there laughing with his friends. Later that same day, when I held the door open for him after lunch, he shoved past and told everyone I was probably hoping for a tip like a doorman. By Thursday of that week, he had progressed to stealing my lunch money during second period and announcing loudly that I was too poor to afford food anyway. Friday afternoon brought another escalation when he shoved me into a locker after PE and made comments about my clothes smelling like thrift store while the entire hallway erupted in laughter. The following week brought even worse treatment. Every time I raised my Hand. During English class on Monday, he interrupted to call me stupid and wrong. When test results came back on Wednesday and I had earned an A, he grabbed my paper right off my desk and ripped it into pieces while telling everyone the teacher probably felt too sorry for me to give me the F I really deserved. During lunch periods throughout that week, his harassment evolved from simply knocking over my tray to something more humiliating. Would grab my sandwich from my reused grocery bag, take a dramatic bite, and spit it out while declaring it was welfare food and mystery meat before throwing everything in the trash. On a particularly bad Thursday, I tried a different approach and offered him my chips, thinking maybe kindness would work. He knocked them out of my hand and ground them into the cafeteria floor with his heel while explaining that he didn't want to catch whatever diseases poor people carry. The entire cafeteria watched in silence. He made me clean up the mess with my bare hands. Physical education class became my daily nightmare after that. He would wait until I was changing clothes, then grab everything I owned and throw it all in the shower, leaving me standing there in my underwear. While I tried to retrieve my soaked clothes, he would loudly describe to the entire locker room how skinny and malnourished I looked from eating dollar store food. The harassment reached new levels the day he found My phone with its cracked screen. In early November, he picked it up and called it ancient junk, then explained that his dad had told him poor people always have broken phones because they can't take care of anything. He threw it on the ground and stomped on it repeatedly until the screen went completely black and the phone wouldn't turn on anymore. When I wore the same jacket three days in a row because my other one was still drying from being thrown in the shower, he started a rumor that I only owned one set of clothes. He would make gagging sounds whenever I walked past in the hallways and hold his nose while telling everyone I hadn't changed my underwear in a week. Career day arrived in mid November, and Bruce had spent the entire week telling everyone how his dad was going to present about being successful in business. The morning of the presentations, he cornered me in the bathroom and pushed my head toward the toilet while his friends held the door shut. He kept my face inches from the water and told me I better get used to cleaning toilets for rich people like him. His dad went first during the presentations, strutting around the classroom.

Ever since I was born, our house had an open door policy. If that open door policy took steroids, my dad specifically loved enforcing it and always told us that if a door was left closed, I could say goodbye to it. I always thought he was joking until I turned 5 and experienced it myself. I was in the room with my dolls with a closed door, when suddenly it slammed open. Next thing I knew, dad had his tools out and was taking the door clean off its hinges. He then went out into the back and burned it. It still had my bunny stickers on it, but he didn't care how hard I cried. On top of that, by dinner, not only the door, but the dolls I bought with my own money were burned, too. I cried to my mom, but all she could say was that dad had anxiety about hidden dangers, so it was best to just let him feel safe. Thing is, this only got worse as I got older. When I got my first period, I desperately wanted some privacy, but the curtain my dad installed wouldn't fully close. Naturally, I shut the door. That's when he barged in, claiming nothing natural needs hiding. He stood there while I changed my tampon in the shower, telling me not to be shy. I thought it couldn't get much Worse. But I was wrong. After weeks of begging my mom for a sleepover, she finally agreed for my 14th birthday. My friends arrived excited, having never visited until they saw our doorless house. There were a few strange glances thrown my way, but we moved on, running straight to my room, giggling with excitement. But the happiness did not last long. My dad started hourly safety patrols with his flashlight, peering into my room. He came in and examined every one of my friends, telling them to twirl to make sure they didn't have anything on him. And since I was the only one with the skirt, I had to twirl the longest. My friends were too creeped out and got their parents to pick them up the next day in school. Everyone was whispering about my doorless house and creepy dad. Their parents banned them from talking to me. I lost all my friends and became completely isolated. I remember at this time I began truly hating my dad, and that only intensified at 16. I woke up to him pulling off my blanket. I screamed at him and he went red before claiming he was searching under my mattress for contraband. My mom actually tried to intervene, but she was dragged out of my room. All I heard was the slap before the house went silent. The next morning, my mom had a bruise, and my door frame had a camera set up in it. I left At 17, with just a backpack to go to college, I didn't speak to either of them for a full 20 years. And I should have left it like that. But one day I decided to bring my 12 year old daughter to visit. I didn't want to see dad, only mom. So I had her promise me that she'd keep my dad away from my daughter. She said yes. Well, at around 2:00am, I woke to the feeling of my daughter pressing into my chest. She was sobbing that Grandpa had been touching her hair. And that's when I saw the blanket we had put up for some privacy have been torn down. Dad had been touching my daughter the whole time we slept. I rushed out and saw him in his room sleeping, pressing the blanket against his chest. I wanted to call him on the spot, but before I had the chance to confront him, my mom appeared out of the bathroom. I could see visible signs of what must have been her attempting to stop him. She broke down and started whisper apologize

I stared at that crumpled 20 and two tens like they were aliens. My daughter Emma was only 7, and I had no clue whose kid I was supposedly feeding. The handwriting was neat, definitely an adult's. And the note was on some fancy stationery with little flowers on it. When Emma got home from school, I showed her the money and asked what was going on. She just shrugged and said, oh, that's from Becca's mom. Becca doesn't have lunch money this week, so I've been sharing my sandwich. My heart melted a little, but I was also confused. Why didn't this mom just pack her own kid lunch? The next morning, I decided to pack extra food just in case. Two sandwiches, two juice boxes, extra crackers. Emma didn't even question it. She just smiled and said, thanks, Dad. Becca will be so happy. I dropped her off at school, then went to work. But I couldn't stop thinking about this Becca kid. That afternoon, I got a call from the school. Mister Williams, we need to discuss something with you about Emma. My stomach dropped. Did she get in trouble? Did something happen? I rushed over there, expecting the worst. The principal, missus Davis, sat me down in her office with this weird look on her face. Your daughter has been bringing extra food every day. This Week and sharing with a classmate. We normally don't allow food sharing because of allergies, but we wanted to talk to you about the situation first. She explained that Becca's family was going through a rough patch. Her mom worked three jobs but still couldn't afford school lunches. They'd applied for the free lunch program, but there was a waiting list. Meanwhile, Becca had been sitting at lunch with nothing but a water bottle. Emma apparently noticed on Monday and just started splitting everything in half. Her sandwich, her apple slices, her cookies. She'd even been giving Becca her juice box and drinking from the water fountain instead. I was proud of my daughter, but also heartbroken. No kid should go hungry at school. I told Missus Davis I wanted to keep packing extra food until Becca's free lunch kicked in. He smiled and said that would be fine, but mentioned that Becca's mom had been trying to find me to pay me back. That evening, there was a knock on our door. A woman in scrubs stood there looking exhausted. Are you Emma's dad? She asked nervously. I'm Janet, Becca's mom. I work at the hospital downtown. She looked like she hadn't slept in days. He pulled out a worn envelope and tried to hand it to me. I know $40 isn't enough for all the food Emma's been sharing, but it's all I have right now. I get paid again on Friday. Her voice was shit.

I'm 23 and my family still cuts my food for me at restaurants. Not kidding. My mom will literally reach over and slice my chicken into bite size pieces while I'm eating it. Growing up as the youngest of seven kids by a huge gap didn't help. My siblings are all 10, 15 years older than me, so they've always treated me like they're living at family dinners. They still ask if I need help tying my shoes or if I remember to brush my teeth. My sister Amanda still tries to help me order at restaurants, telling servers she'll have the chicken nuggets without asking what I want. Last month at my cousin Abigail's wedding was the absolute worst. The whole extended family was there, aunts, uncles, grandparents, great aunts, family, friends. The worst, during cocktail hour, my Aunt Janet loudly announced that I couldn't have champagne because babies don't drink alcohol. She handed me a juice box instead. A juice box at a wedding? I'm 23 years old with a medical degree. Then came dinner seating. My Uncle Mark grabbed my arm and said, come on, sweetie, you're sitting at the kids table. I tried to protest, explaining I was an adult, but he was already walking me over to a table full of actual children. Eight year olds coloring on place mats. Ten year olds playing with action figures and me with my college degree and my Job that none of them bothered asking about. The kids kept asking me questions like what grade are you in and do you like our coloring books? I spent the entire dinner helping a six year old nephew cut his chicken while my family laughed from the adult tables, pointing and taking photos like it was cute. My cousin Kelly walked over during appetizers. Ah, look at you helping the little ones, she cooed. Maybe someday you'll be ready for grown up conversations. She patted my head like I was a golden retriever. The breaking point came during cake cutting. When the bride and groom finished their ceremonial first slice, they started serving guests. My Uncle Mark walked over with a plate and a plastic fork. A plastic fork. Let me help you with this, honey, he said, and started cutting my slice into tiny little pieces like I was a toddler who might choke. Uncle Mark, I can be careful with the fork, sweetie. He interrupted, taking it from my hands. We don't want any accident. Remember what happened at Christmas when you tried to use the good silverware? I hadn't dropped anything at Christmas. He was just making stuff up. The entire reception was staring at this point. Other guests were whispering and pointing. Some were filming with their phones. I felt my face burning with embarrassment. That's when the bridesmaid of honor walked over. She was this elegant woman in her 40s looking confused. Excuse, excuse me. Are you Dr Nguyen? She asked, staring directly at me. Everyone at nearby tables turned to look. My Aunt Janet burst out laughing like this was the funniest thing she'd ever heard. Oh, honey, that's just our baby cousin, she said condescendingly. She still figuring out college classes and living in the dorms, playing dress up as a doctor. Aren't you, sweetie? The woman's face went from confused to absolutely shocked. Ma'am, this is Doctor Engyen. She performed emergency brain surgery on my 6 year old daughter.

My family still makes me weigh myself before holiday dinners. Not joking. My Aunt Rose keeps a scale by her front door specifically for me. Growing up as the fat cousin shaped everything about family gatherings. Even though I lost 140 pounds three years ago, they refuse to see it. I wear oversized hoodies to every family event now. The baggy clothes hide my body because years of their comments train me to cover up. They make me enter through the garage because they claim the front steps can't support me. My cousin Derek still calls me Big Mac and makes earthquake sound effects when I walk. Last Christmas, they gave me a group gift of weight loss surgery pamphlets and a biggest loser DVD set. Thanksgiving This year was what revealed everything. The entire extended family was there. Aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents, second cousins, everyone. My grandmother had rented a huge cabin for the weekend. The torture started immediately. When I walked in, Uncle Edward yelled across the room that they'd reinforced the deck chairs. Don't want another incident like the fourth of July. He laughed. There was no incident on the fourth of July. The whole room erupted in laughter. My cousin Marissa grabbed my plate at dinner before I could. I'll serve you, she announced. Portion control is important. She put three green beans and a spoonful of Turkey on my plate. Nothing else. When I reached for the Mashed potatoes. She slapped my hand. Those aren't for you. My teenage cousins started a betting pool on whether I'd sneak food later. They used a whiteboard in the living room to track their bets where everyone could see. Twenty dollars said I'd raid the fridge by midnight. 30 said I'd eat a whole pie. After dinner, they made me sit on the floor. The couch has a weight limit, Aunt Rose explained to her new boyfriend. We have to be careful. She said it like I wasn't even there. Like I was some kind of safety hazard. I tried to tell them about my transformation. I've lost a lot of weight. I start. Derek burst out laughing so hard he spit out his drink. Sure you have, Big Mac. What did you lose five pounds? The room exploded. Even my mom was giggling. Honey, stop making things up, she said. It's okay to be who you are. The worst part came during family photos. They made me stand in the back corner for balance, the photographer said, after my aunt whispered something to him. Then my Uncle Edward announced, I should probably skip the group jump photo. Safety first, he said, patting his stomach and winking at everyone. My cousin filmed the whole thing for her Instagram story. The caption read, Chunky's still dreaming of being skinny. With crying, laughing emojis. That's when the cabin owner walked in with his son to say hi to everyone. The son stopped Dead in his tracks, staring at me. He was this athletic guy in his 30s. Looked like he lived at the gym. No way, he said, his voice cutting through the chatter. Are you Benson Clark, the gym trainer? My Aunt Rose laughed. Him. He can barely transform himself to the couch. The man ignored her completely. His excitement was building. This is insane, dad. This is the guy I told you about. He saved my life. The room went quiet. My Uncle Edward snorted. Chunky saved your life? What did he do? Eat all the donuts before you could get diabetes? The man's face went serious. Two years ago, I weighed 300 pounds. I found his program when I was planning to end everything. He runs one of the best transformation programs out there. I lost 100 pounds. Pulled out his phone, showing before and after photos. This man owns a chain of successful gyms. Major companies pay him, massive sponsorships. He's transformed thousands of lives. My Aunt Rose's smile froze. That's. That's impossible. He works at a fast food place. The man looked confused. Fast food? He just bought the entire

I found my work crush share crying in the break room, looking completely stressed. My dad's in the hospital and I need to fly out tonight, but I can't find anyone to watch my kids. My ex won't answer. The babysitter I hired bailed. And I just, I can't afford to miss this flight, but I can't afford anything else either. She leaned against my shoulder crying even harder. I volunteered without thinking. I'll watch them, I said, heart racing from how close she was to me. Are you serious? It's three kids, 3 for at least two weeks. I waved my hand around like a lovesick fool. How hard can it be? The kids showed up at my apartment that night with tons of suitcases. The oldest, around 14, looked at her mom and said, really? Another boyfriend? Cher's face went red. He's just a friend from work. Camilla, the middle one, 10, rolled his eyes. The youngest, 7, wouldn't even look at me. They stood in my doorway like they were being sentenced to prison. Cher hugged them quickly, told them to be good and left for the airport. I stood there with three kids who clearly hated me and realized I was in way over my head. The first morning I woke up early to make them pancakes. When the oldest one, Camilla, laughed, she's not here, you know, you can stop trying. She Said, besides, you're not her type. Mom doesn't date guys without kids. We seen this a dozen times already. It hurt, but it wasn't a lie. Shares, co workers, guys from her gym, men from dating apps, everyone wanted to play dad until they realized three kids meant actual work. And the kids really didn't make it any easier. From spilling drinks on my laptop to turning the TV up during important zoom meetings, they hated every second with me. Dude, just survive until she gets back, then ask her out. My friend told me that became the plan. Survive 2 weeks, do whatever to keep the kids happy, be the hero, finally land a date with share. But like most things, it doesn't always happen the way you want it to. Some time within the second week, the middle kid, Murph, came home from school trying to hide a black eye. Before I could even ask, Camilla grabbed ice from the freezer and held it against his face. Just pretend you didn't see anything, she told me coldly. I bent down beside them and asked in a kind but stern voice, tell me what happened. Just leave me alone, he said. Turning away, I shook my head. I'm not here to lecture you or get mad at you or do anything without your permission, not even tell your mom. But I need to know what happened. Murph blinked at me and frowned. Someone called me an orphan because I Don't have a dad. I patted his head and thanked him, walking away as calm as I could, even though all the blood in my body was boiling with anger. Next afternoon, I took a half day at work and showed up at their school in a rented GTR, strikingly white engine, purring like a monster. I rolled down the window and waved, wearing sunglasses and a black polo. Who's got the coolest dad now, I said loudly as Murph and his friends ran over excitedly. Murph watched his bully's jaw drop and quickly hopped in. He rolled down the window and flipped him off, which was my signal to immediately drive off the middle school campus. Okay, I like the enthusiasm, but let's never tell your mother about this, I said. Grinning, I picked up the other two kids and took them to in and out for a quick afternoon snack, then surprised them with a baseball game. Murph ate in a helmet full of nachos and I managed to snag a foul ball for little Celia. Not bad, old man, Camilla said, watching her siblings enjoy the game, we made sure to take pics with the car and at the stadium, all covered in ketchup and mustard, sent everything to their mom with a caption, we wish you were here. After that, things between me and the kids sort of changed when the youngest, Celia, had a nightmare and called for her mom. I sat beside her bed. Reading out fairy tales until she fell asleep. I made the kids meals and lunch box.

My best friend Mike called me at 3:00am last Tuesday, voice shaking. I need to tell you something, and I need you to listen without hanging up. We've been friends since middle school, so I knew something was seriously wrong. Remember that guy Derek, who kept harassing my sister at work? The one who followed her home and kept showing up at her apartment? I remembered Derek was this creepy older guy who wouldn't take no for an answer. Mike's sister Emma, had filed multiple complaints, but nothing stuck. Well, he's not going to bother anyone anymore, Mike said quietly. My blood went cold. What do you mean, he's not going to bother anyone? There was this long pause where I could hear Mike breathing heavily through the phone. I was driving home from Emma's place last night around midnight. She'd been crying because Derek showed up at her work again, this time with flowers and a note saying he knew where she lived. I was so angry I could barely see straight, Mike continued. That's when I saw Derek's car parked outside her apartment complex. He was just sitting there in the dark, watching her windows. I pulled over and walked up to his car. When he saw me, he started laughing and said Emma would come around eventually. I snapped. I dragged him out of the car, and we started fighting in the parking lot. But then he Hit his head on the concrete when he fell. There was so much blood and he wasn't moving. I checked for a pulse, but there was nothing. My hands were shaking as I held the phone. Mike, please tell me you called 9 1 1. Another long silence. I panicked. I put his body in his trunk and drove his car to the old quarry outside town. You know, the one where we used to go swimming as kids. The car is at the bottom of the lake now with Derek inside. I hiked back to my car and drove home like nothing happened. I felt sick to my stomach. This was my best friend. The guy who helped me through my parents divorce, who was the best man at my wedding. Mike, we need to call the police right now. This was self defense, or at least manslaughter. If you explain what happened. No, he interrupted. They'll never believe me. A guy with Derek's background doesn't just disappear without someone looking into it. But if they find the car, I'm going to prison for murder. The next few days were torture. I couldn't eat and sleep. Couldn't look at my wife without feeling like I was keeping this horrible secret. Mike acted completely normal, even asking if I wanted to grab drinks that weekend. But something felt wrong about his story. Derek was a big guy, probably 200 pounds. Mike was maybe 150, soaking wet. How did he drag A body that size and get it into a trunk by himself? And why would Derek be parked outside Emma's apartment when she moved to a new place across town two weeks ago? I started doing some digging. I called Emma and casually asked how she was doing with the Derek situation. Oh, that's been resolved for weeks, she said. My new boyfriend Jake had a talk with him, and Derek hasn't bothered me since. When did this happen? I asked about three weeks ago. Jake used to play college football, and I think Derek got the message pretty clearly three weeks ago. But Mike said this happened last Tuesday. Then I remembered something else. Mike had been acting strange for months, not just the past week. Paranoid, jumpy, asking weird questions about loyalty and friendship. He'd been having money problems, too. Something about gambling debts. I decided to drive out to the quarry myself. If there really was a car down there, I needed to see it with my own eyes. When I got to the spot where we used to swim, the water was crystal clear. You could

Our chemistry teacher, Mr Rodriguez, had this insane rule. If your phone made any sound during class, he'd lock it in his desk for a full week. Not the day, the entire week. Senior year, everyone knew someone who'd lost their phone to him. He kept them like trophies in his desk drawer, grinning whenever kids begged to get them back. There was this quiet kid, Marcus, who worked nights at McDonald's to help his mom pay bills. Twelve year old sister Lily walked home from Jefferson Middle every day through this sketchy area near the auto shops on Fifth Street. She was supposed to text Marcus the second she got home. One Tuesday during our midterm, Marcus's phone buzzed just once. Text. Rodriguez didn't even look up from his crossword puzzle, just held out his fat hand phone. See you next Tuesday, Mr Johnson. Marcus went pale. Please, Mr Rodriguez, my sister should have put it on silent. Your poor planning isn't my emergency. Marcus actually got on his knees, begged, explained about his mom's double shifts at the hospital, about Lily being alone, about the creeps who hung around that neighborhood. Rodriguez just smiled and slid the phone into his desk. Maybe you'll think twice next time. That afternoon changed everything. Lily never made it home. Some freak in a white van had been watching Jefferson Middle for weeks when she tried calling Marcus 1st like she always did when scared. His phone phone just rang in Rodriguez's locked drawer. She was missing for four hours. Four hours of Marcus pacing the McDonald's parking lot, checking the time, knowing something was wrong, but having no way to know what. Police found her behind the Valvoline on 8th. Physically okay, but she wouldn't stop shaking, wouldn't talk for three days. Marcus came to school the next morning looking like he'd aged 10 years. He walked straight to Rodriguez's room during lunch. I need my phone back.

When I was 7, I was attacked by a German Shepherd. I nearly died after three surgeries, but I never told my husband grant, because his whole family raises golden retrievers, and they literally have more photos with dogs than with people. On our third date, grant suggested we visit a dog park, and I panicked and said, I'm allergic. When his face just dropped. I added, severely allergic. And now it's been eight years of this ridiculous lie. I carry fake Epipen filled with vitamin water like some kind of spy. I've left 17 birthday parties doing my whole itchy eyes performance. The worst part is our kids beg for a dog every single Christmas, and grant always tells them, you know, mom can't be around dogs. Sweetie could kill her. I'm literally going to hell. Then after about a week, I started to notice grant has been doing laundry constantly now. Which is weird, because this man once wore the same shirt for a week. He says he just wants to help more, but something feels really off about it. My son suddenly volunteers to take out the trash every single day, and he literally sprints to the garage, then to the bins like he's training for the Olympics. He won't even let me help when the bags are heavy. Meanwhile, my daughter keeps spending time in the garage organizing dad's tools, which makes zero sense. Because this girl thinks a Philip's head is a hairstyle. But then I find these muddy paw prints by the garage door yesterday, and they're definitely not from a cat like grant claims. Because what cat has paws the size of a toddler's hand? There's creepy scratching sounds from the garage at night and grant says it's probably raccoons. But since when do raccoons whimper? Then credit card Bill comes in and I see it has a 47 dollar charge from Petsmart. Grant says it's fraudulent and he'll handle it, but he never actually calls the think about it. I find a bag of dog food in Grant's trunk when I'm getting groceries and he says it's for donations at work, but his office doesn't even have a coffee fund, let alone donation drives. This morning I wake up and there's blonde hair on my pillow. That confirms it for me and I'm about to fake a reaction, but then my brain kicks in because if I have an allergic reaction now, grant will wonder why I didn't have one while I was literally sleeping face first in it all night. So I just vacuum it up quickly and pretend I saw nothing. Grant starts testing me at dinner, casually mentions the neighbor got a new puppy, and watches my face like he's a detective. So I have to do my whole routine, scratch my arms and sniffle, but he looks suspicious. My son asks mom what happens if someone With allergies. Accidentally touches a dog but doesn't know. My heart stops, and I ask why this little boy has the nerve to say, just curious for science class. But I know they're studying volcanoes. My daughter leaves her phone open to Google search. Is about how to tell if someone is really allergic. And can allergies suddenly go away? Which makes my stomach drop because my 12 year old is apparently Sherlock Holmes. Now, this morning, grant says he found fur on our bed sheets. He shows me this chunk of long golden fur and says, the window was open, must have blown in from somewhere. So I have to pretend to feel itchy and take a fake Benadryl in front of him. All the while, he watches me swallow it like he's monitoring a science experiment. I even had to open my mouth and lift up my tongue. Then he says something that makes my blood freeze. Funny thing. I found your allergy medication in the bathroom. And he holds up my prescription bottle. I looked up these pills, and the markings don't match Benadryl. They match vitamin C tablets. He continues, and his voice is so calm, it's terrifying. Also, you slept on that pillow with fur for hours with no reaction. And yesterday when you were napping, something else happened in our bed that should have sent you to the hospital. I literally can't breathe. Because he knows. They all know. But then he says, we Need to talk in the garage. All of us. Right now. I follow them like I'm walking to my execute. I open the door and immediately find a golden retriever puppy jumping on me, licking my entire face, fur absolutely everywhere. And my skin doesn't react. No hives, no, no sneezing, nothing. Instead, I scream bloody murder and trip trying to run away. My daughter starts crying, and grant says quietly, this dog slept in our bed yesterday. On your pillow. Actually, we have a video. That's when my son whispers, three months. We've had him three months. The dog brings me a tennis ball like we're best friends. And nobody knows what to say.

Like, bro, real friends don't need to be in the same classroom or even the same postcode to stay tight. You could be across the city in a different uniform, learning completely different subjects, but somehow the bond never fades. Everyone else is like, oh, if you don't go to the same school, you'll drift apart. Nah, bro, not us. I could be sitting in math class stressed out over equations I'll never use in life, and you're across town doing science experiments, and we're still texting dumb memes like we saw each other five minutes ago. And when we do link up on the weekend, it's like we never left. No awkward vibes, no weird energy, just straight vibes. Bro, we might not be in the same school, but we've got the same mindset, same humor, same jokes, same energy. And the best part? When you meet their school friends and suddenly you feel famous, like, oh, you're that friend they always talk about. Yeah, that's me. I don't even go here, but I run this friendship. So if you've got a friend that's in another school but still feels closer than anyone in your class, appreciate that. That's real friendship. Forget proximity. It's about loyalty.

My younger sister, Ariana, turned into a homewrecker the moment my husband Kevin slipped the ring on my finger and started a desperate pick me routine. If Kevin were blue, she'd show up in blue. If you mention liking something, she'd become an expert overnight. If you posted about a restaurant, she coincidentally appeared during our date. It started subtle, almost innocent even, like sitting next to Kevin. At every family dinner, Ariana would squeeze between us, claiming she couldn't hear from the other end. I didn't mind, since family is family. But after six months, it got obvious. Kevin joined a gym near his office. Ariana got a membership there the next day, showing up during his workout times in tiny sports bras. Kevin mentioned liking astronomy once. Suddenly, Ariana was texting him NASA articles daily, asking, can you explain this to me? Then came the fake emergencies. Her car broke down near Kevin's office. Her apartment had a gas leak. When I was out of town, she needed help moving heavy boxes that turned out to be empty. Kevin always told me immediately, showing me her texts with eye rolls. She's just young and confused, he'd say, and I agreed. Until she officially went too far. A hard knock at 9:00am, and there stood Ariana in a tiny white sundress, full makeup, hair curled like a magazine. Shoot! I need Kevin's help moving furniture, she announced, pushing past me. Where is he? But we both knew she lived in a furnished apartment. I was about to tell her to leave when she added, I'm sure you have errands to run. You can go away now. She was literally trying to dismiss me from my own home. Kevin came downstairs and she immediately grabbed his arm. Oh, perfect. You're already dressed. I promise I'll return him in one piece. She actually winked at me. I felt my chest burn with rage, but then had a different thought. I headed upstairs, loudly saying, I need to take a bath. But I didn't leave or go to the bathroom. I stayed upstairs where I could hear everything through the vents. Didn't waste any time. Oh my God, Kevin, you're so muscular! She giggled, clearly touching his arm. Do you work out every day? I bet you could lift me with one hand. Wanna try? I rolled my eyes. This girl had zero shame. I kept holding laundry, waiting for Kevin's polite deflection. Instead, I heard him say, seriously, Ariana, can I tell you something important? My heart sank. Oh, god, here we

Like why is that step even required? Why do I have to risk my soul insanity in a sweaty emotional situation just to unlock the baby starter pack? The fact people would know I did too. And the way people say but it's all worth it in the end. Like girl, that's what they say after surviving a car crash. You're not convincing me to grow a human like it's a houseplant when I literally forget to feed myself some days. I'm not stable enough to be a life factory. why is no one talking about the fact that you don't even get a break after the baby's born?

I don't even read the instructions on frozen waffles and now I'm supposed to build a whole human from scratch? And don't even get me started on baby names cause I already know I'd name my kid something adorable. And then he'd grow up to be a middle school menace with a mullet and a scooter who calls teachers by their first name? I'm not risking all that just to have my custom baby turn out like a Fortnite sweat who screams into a headset and tells other 12 year olds you're trash while I'm in the back crying over how I spent 9 months assembling this child just for him to rage quit over losing in Roblox Obby level 2. And the emotions. I crashed out yesterday because my charger fell behind the bed. Now imagine me pregnant.

So my kids daycare had some family emergency and shut down for the day. They sent this email at like 3 in the morning, which was real helpful when I'm already asleep and have to work the next day. I'm scrambling around trying to find someone to watch my kid because I literally could not miss work that day. Had this huge presentation that would basically make or break my job. So I'm calling everyone I know at like 6:00am. The only person who picks up is my stepbrother's girlfriend, Ashley. She doesn't work, just sits around all day while my stepbrother pays for everything. I mean everything. Her daily Starbucks runs, weekly nail appointments, a whole designer purse collection. been trying to get her to do literally anything productive for years. But whatever, I'm desperate. I call her up, and she's like, oh, sure, I can totally watch him for you. I'm thinking, finally, someone's actually gonna help me out. Then she hits me with it. My family rate is $200 for six hours. I literally had to ask her to repeat that because I thought I heard wrong. $200 for six hours to watch one kid who mostly just plays with his tablet anyway? Are you being serious right now? I asked. She goes on this whole speech about how this is her livelihood and she takes childcare very seriously and that she's already giving me a family Discount. I'm thinking, what livelihood? You haven't worked a day since you moved in with my stepbrother three years ago. But I'm stuck. If I don't show up to work that day, I'm literally getting fired. So I agree to her insane price, and she demands the money up front before I even drop my kid off. I hand over $200 cash, drive to work fuming, and end up working barely four hours after you factor in traffic. So I basically paid 50 bucks an hour for her to sit on her couch and make sure my kid didn't burn the house down. Fast forward two years. Ashley and my stepbrother break up, but somehow she ends up living rent free in his dad's extra house and driving my dad's old car. My stepbrother still pays all her bills because they have a kid together. Now. She finally gets a job at some retail place because he stopped funding her weekly spa days. Then last month, I get this panicked text in our family group chat. Emergency. My babysitter bailed, and I have to work today or I'll get fired. Can anyone watch my daughter, please? I'm desperate. I'm reading this text, and I can't help but smile a little. I text her back super fast, I can totally help you out. I'll watch her. She's so relieved and grateful, sending me heart emojis and everything. Then I hit her with the kicker. My family rate is $200 for the Day, the typing bubbles appear and disappear, like, five times. Then my phone starts blowing up. Are you kidding me right now? That's way too much. I thought we were family. You're being ridiculous. Just screenshot our old conversation from two years ago and send it back to her. This is the exact same rate you charged me. You said it was the family rate, remember? You said you took this very seriously. She completely lost it. Started calling me every name in the book, saying I was petty and vindictive and that she was in a real emergency. I told her that's exactly what I said to her two years ago. The best part? She ended up having to call out of work anyway because nobody else would watch her kid for free on such short notice. And apparently, her manager was not happy about it.

This rich kid at my college paid me $500 to take his final exam. For him not cheat. Literally show up as him. See, Brad was this trust fund baby who partied through freshman year while I worked three jobs just to afford ramen. His dad threatened to cut him off if he failed chemistry. And Brad was looking at a solid F. Problem was, Brad and I looked almost identical. Same height, same messy brown hair. Even wore the same thick rimmed glasses. People mixed us up constantly. Which gave Brad a brilliant idea. He cornered me outside the library one Tuesday, panic in his eyes. You're a science major, right? Just walk in, take the test, walk out. 500 cash. I thought he was insane, but $500 was two months of rent money. My bank account had $47 in it, and my landlord was already leaving threatening notes. So I agreed to the stupidest plan ever. For two weeks, I lived and breathed chemistry. I memorized Brad's textbook, practiced his signature until my hand cramped. Even Learned to write with my left hand, since he was left handed. I studied his social media to copy his mannerisms. The kid barely knew what carbon was, but I was determined to nail this thing. I even got his roommate to help me practice. You need to slouch more, he said. Brad never sits up straight, and he always taps his pen when He's thinking the day of the exam, I showed up 20 minutes early, put up trying to look casual. My hands were shaking as I walked into the lecture hall. 200 students, and I was pretending to be someone else. The professor barely glanced at Brad student ID when I handed it over. Good luck, Bradley, he said without looking up. I found Brad's usual seat in the back corner and sat down. My heart was pounding so loud, I thought everyone could hear it. When they handed out the test, I felt confident. The first 30 questions were exactly what I'd studied. Molecular structures, chemical equations, periodic table stuff. I was flying through it. Then I hit question 47. Describe the quantum mechanical model of electron behavior in metallic bonding under extreme pressure conditions. I stared at the question for five full minutes. This wasn't just advanced chemistry. This was graduate level theoretical stuff. I'd never seen anything like it in Brad's textbook. That's when it hit me. Brad had been skipping so much class, he'd missed entire units. The professor had been covering cutting edge research while Brad was passed out in his dorm. I was complete. We screwed. Panic set in. I looked around the room. Everyone else was writing furiously. Some girl in the front row was already on the back page. I had two choices. Leave half the test blank and guarantee Brad fails, or make something up and hope for partial credit. So I Started inventing chemistry. I wrote about electrons forming pressure cascades and quantum tunnels under extreme conditions. I made up equations that sounded scientific but were complete nonsense. I described metals becoming molecularly fluid and electrons fade. He's shifting into higher dimensions. It was like writing science fiction, but with chemical formulas. When I handed in the test, the professor actually looked up from his papers. He flipped through my answers with raised eyebrows. Interesting approach, Bradley, he said slowly.

Brad thought scaring people was hilarious, and his kids did, too. Every morning, his dogs attack the fence while his boys laughed at crying kindergartners. At the 4th of July barbecue, he let all three dogs loose while his kids timed the chaos. When our HOA tried discussing dog rules, Brad brought his meanest one and nobody would speak up. His brother worked for Animal Control and made complaints disappear. Here, things got worse. After Brad realized nobody would stop him, he started training his dogs in the front yard while his boys kept score. They had a whole system where old people were worth one point, but runners were worth five. His wife Lauren started taking the kids to her mother's house during training sessions. I tried asking him to keep the dogs in back during school hours. The next day, his older son stood at the bus stop with Rex. The chain was just short enough to not reach the sidewalk. Kids pressed against the opposite fence anyway. Brad filmed it from his porch while his younger boy counted how many kids cried. Whenever anyone complained, Brad would claim discrimination against pitbulls. He threatened to sue for harassment and mention his brother at animal control. he'd let his dogs accidentally get loose near the complainer's house. he started bringing raw meat to the park during family Picnics, his dogs would fight over it while his kids cheered. At the farmers market, he'd act shocked when they lunged at other pets. Lauren stopped coming to neighborhood events after people begged her to intervene. My puppy Milo was everything Brad's dogs weren't. My mom gave him to me two weeks before she died of cancer. Was this gentle golden retriever who loved everyone. Brad kept saying I was raising a marshmallow, not a dog. That morning, I just let Milo out. When I noticed Brad's kids by their back gate, the older boy was teaching the younger one something about the latch. I had a bad feeling and moved toward the door, pull it fast and watch him work, the kids said. The gate flew open and Rex burst through like a missile. I screamed and ran but knew I wouldn't make it. Hit Milo hard and went straight for his throat. Brad appeared on his deck holding his Sunday newspaper and coffee. His kids whooped and hollered while my puppy fought for his life. I pleaded with Brad to intervene. He checked his watch like he was timing it. The emergency vet couldn't save Milo. She said Rex had been trained for quick kills, not regular dog fights. The police claimed without video evidence, their hands were tied. Brad's response when I confronted him was that I'd Learned why people get real Protection dogs. His kids high fived him and went back inside. I buried Milo under His favorite tree and a week planning. Brad posted constantly about hunting trips and being an APEX predator. He thought fear was entertainment, but I'd show him what being prey felt like. I studied the woods behind our properties and found paths between the trees. Mrs. Chen.

The school called me during a client meeting. Your daughter won't stop crying. We need you here now. My stomach dropped. Maya never cried at school. She was my tough girl who scraped her knee last month and asked for a Spider Man Band Aid while blood ran down her leg. I left my presentation half finished and drove like the world was ending. The secretary's face was pale when I walked in. She pointed down the hall without speaking. That scared me more than the phone call. Maya sat curled in the corner of the nurse's office, arms wrapped around her knees. Her favorite purple dress was torn at the shoulder. The butterfly hair clips I'd put in that morning were gone. When I touched her arm, she jerked away like I was made of electricity. Baby, what happened? I whispered. She wouldn't look at me. Just kept staring at the wall with empty eyes. The nurse shifted uncomfortably and told me Maya hadn't said a word since PE class ended. Missus Johnson brought her in like this. I took Maya home. She sat in the back seat, not her usual spot, next to me. That night, she wouldn't eat her favorite Mac and cheese, wouldn't watch cartoons. Just sat on her bed holding her stuffed elephant while helping her into pajamas. I saw them. Finger shaped bruises on her upper arms. Dark purple marks where someone had grabbed her hard. My hands shook. Maya, who did this? She finally looked at me. Her voice came out so small. Mister Garcia said if I tell, he'll hurt you. He said nobody believes little girls anyway. Mister Garcia, the PE teacher parents loved because he coached the winning soccer team. The one who high fived kids in the hallway, who'd been teaching for 15 years. I called 9 1 1 that night. The female officer who interviewed Maya was gentle, patient. Maya told her everything. How Mister Garcia took her to the equipment room during class. How he made her play a secret game. How it hurt. How he did it to other girls, too, during their special practice time. The principal called me at six am. Not to apologize, to scold me. He said I should have come to him first. That calling police was premature. That Mr. Garcia was a valued member of their community. I recorded the entire call.

The Disney princess stopped mid autograph, stared at my ankle, then at my six year old daughter, Emma, then back at my ankle. Sir, is that she started clearly breaking character, which apparently requires something serious at the Happiest place on earth. It's not what you think, I said quickly, but Cinderella was already flagging security. Within minutes, I was surrounded by three guards and mouse ear hats trying to look threatening, while tourists took photos of what they assumed was part of the show. Here's the thing. I'm not a criminal. The ankle monitor was court ordered, but not for the reason everyone assumes. My ex wife, Patricia, claimed I was a flight risk during our custody battle. Said I might take Emma to Brazil because I'd renewed my passport. I renewed it for a work conference in Toronto. Judge still ordered the monitor as a caution until custody was finalized. I've been wearing it for three months, setting off every metal detector in Orange County. Emma didn't understand why Cinderella looked scared. Daddy, why is the princess sad? I knelt down, ankle monitor clicking against the pavement. She's just confused about daddy's special bracelet. Security moved closer. One spoke into his radio, we have a code yellow in fantasy land. I didn't know what that meant, but it sounded bad. Tourists started pulling their kids away from us. One mom loudly whispered, that's why we check The registry, Karen. The head of security, a surprisingly intimidating man named Raul, escorted us to Disney jail. Yes, that's a real thing. It's a small office behind Main Street that smells like churros and broken dreams. Emma thought it was a VIP experience. Are we getting special Mickey ears? She asked. Raul pulled up my information on his computer. His expression shifted from suspicious to confused to sympathetic. City battle? He asked quietly. I nodded. He sighed. My brother went through the same thing. Judge made him wear one for six months because his ex said he'd flee to Cuba. He's never even been to Cuba. Raul made some calls 20 minutes late. Later, we had a Disney escort. Not because I was dangerous, but because Raul felt bad. No kids should have their Disney trip ruined by adult problems, he said. Our escort, Jerome, was a former NBA player who'd retired to work at Disney because he loved making kids happy. Emma rode on his shoulders the entire day. We skipped every line, got front row seats to every show. Jerome told everyone I was a special guest, which technically wasn't a lie. The ankle monitor kept setting off the sensors on rides. Space Mountain stopped three times because of me. They had to manually override the system. By the third ride, the operators knew me by name. Ankle monitor dad is back, they'd radio ahead. It became a running joke. One operator said, you know, we've had Weapons, drugs, even a snake once. But you're our first ankle monitor. I chose to take that as an achievement. Plot twist came at dinner. We were at the character meal when goofy sat down at our table. He pointed at my ankle, then did an elaborate MIME of being arrested, going to court, then being innocent. Emma laughed hysterically. Goofy's silly daddy. But then goofy pulled out his phone.

So I gave him exactly what he asked for. It started when I wore a tank top and shorts to the grocery store on a 90 degree day. You're not leaving the house dressed like a SLT, my dad said. While I was grabbing my car keys, I looked down at my completely normal summer outfit. Cover yourself up because I'm not having my daughter walking around looking like she's for sale, he continued. His face red with anger. I went back upstairs and changed into jeans and a hoodie despite the heat. And he nodded approvingly while saying this was about respect and dignity and protecting my reputation. That night I did some online shopping with his credit card since he cared so much about my clothing choices. Thank you for helping me understand modesty, I said. The next morning wearing a full length denim dress that covered everything except my hands and face. He seemed pleased until we got to his office barbecue where everyone kept asking if I was feeling okay and why I was dressed for winter. She's exploring modest fashion, he explained uncomfortably, while his co workers exchanged concerned looks and I stood there sweating through three layers of fabric. Monday, I wore a beekeeper's suit to school because dad had been very clear about covering up and protecting myself from unwanted attention. The principal called him within an hour asking if Everything was alright at home and whether I was being forced to wear extreme religious garments, it just a phase, my dad told them. But I made sure to explain loudly in the main office that my father said my body was shameful and needed to be completely hidden from men's eyes. The counsellor started taking notes while my dad's face turned purple. Tuesday brought his important client dinner at the country club and I arrived in a full birka. I'd ordered express shipping from Amazon. This is our daughter, my dad said weekly, as his Japanese investors stared in complete confusion. They kept asking questions about our family's religious beliefs and whether this was common in American households while I sat silently eating through my face covering. His biggest client pulled him aside to discuss their concerns about doing business with someone who had such extreme views about women. And I heard my dad desperately trying to explain it was just teenage rebellion. Wednesday, I upgraded to a hazmat suit for his company picnic because he'd mentioned Protection so many times that biological Protection seemed appropriate. His boss's wife cornered him by the potato salad to express her deep concern about what was happening in our home. If you need resources for controlling behavior or religious extremism, we have employee assistance programs, she said, while I stood nearby in my yellow containment suit explaining to anyone who asked that my dad said my skin was too dangerous to be Exposed to the public, Thursday was parent teacher conferences and I wore a Victorian morning dress, complete with a black veil that covered my entire face. My teacher asked my dad Point Blank if he was abusing me or forcing me into a cult while I sat there looking like a Gothic ghost from 1850. She seems to be crying for help, the teacher said sternly, while my dad tried to explain that I was doing this to myself. But she'd already seen my essay about how my father called me a slut for wearing normal clothes. Friday, I went full throttle when I wore a full medieval suit of armour to his promotion announcement dinner because nothing says covered up like actual metal plating. The clanking drew everyone's attention as I walked in and his regional manager immediately asked why his daughter was dressed like she was going into battle. My dad says my body is a weapon that needs to be contained. I announced to the entire restaurant and several people took out their phones to record while my dad tried to disappear into his chair. His promotion was put on hold pending an investigate into his home situation. Saturday morning, the neighbours had organised an intervention after seeing me mow the lawn in a radiation suit all week. We're concerned about your daughter's well being, Mrs. Jacob said, while six other concerned parents stood behind her. They documented everything with photos and time, time stamps, creating what they Called evidence of escalating abuse. My dad kept insisting I was doing this to spite him, but I maintained perfect innocence and said I was just following his rules about modesty and covering my shame full body. By Sunday, his girlfriend had dumped him via text, she couldn't date someone who psychologically tortured his daughter. His boss had suggested he take family leave to deal with his issues and Child Protective Services had opened a case file after receiving 17 different reports from concerned citizens. He sat at the kitchen table with his head in his hands while I stood there in my newest purchase, which was a full deep sea diving suit, complete with brass helmet. Please stop this, he begged. But I reminded him that he said I dressed like a slut and needed to cover up. Fine. Wear whatever you want, he said in defeat. But then his phone rang and his lawyer's name appeared on the screen. My mom had heard about everything from concerned friends and was filing for.

My mom is the academic baddie of the family. She has three degrees and one PhD, all from Ivy Leagues. And whenever I won an academic award, she'd brag about it for weeks, say it was all because of her. That was her thing. It was like she still wanted to hang on to her glory days. Well, I wasn't going to be the one to ruin that. So when she wanted all of my college application essays to go through her first, I let her. After all, she was the one to get my GPA up to 4.2. But then something strange happened. No college was accepting me, and I never received a single rejection email either. Instead, I got angry, sometimes even threatening ones like Harvard, who said my essay was a disgrace, or brown, who threatened to have me blacklisted from other schools. It was around this time that I started to notice a pattern. Every time I got rejected, she got this look in her eyes like she'd known all along, like she wanted it that way. But there was only one college I actually wanted to go to, university of North Carolina at Charlotte. I never told my mom about it because it wasn't an Ivy League. Plus, I didn't want her to think I was a failure for not getting accepted into yet another college. But then something strange happened. I got an interview within just two weeks. Of applying. They told me I was exactly the kind of student they were looking for. And that evening, I couldn't help myself. I did the craziest thing known to mankind. I told my mother. And despite everything, I still expected her to jump up with excitement or at least smile. But no. Instead, she just said, that's wonderful, sweetie, but don't get too excited. You don't want to be disappointed. I stared at her blankly. It was the first time I asked myself whether my mom really wanted the best for me. And I reminded myself about all the hours she had put into making me study, how my GPA was only high because of her. So I told myself the same thing she's always said to me, that I was being ungrateful. But after a week, I finally snapped because my dream college told me I was the perfect candidate. But week later, I got the email from U N. C. Charlotte. There it was in plain red, Ariel font, rejected. It was the nastiest email I had ever seen. Didn't even mention my grades, just talked about my poor character. But I wasn't confused. I knew that somehow my mom was behind it. So I stopped telling her anything, found a tiny school 3 states away that she never heard of, applied in secret, got in, packed my car the day after graduation and left while she was at her stupid book club for the first few Weeks, she called me every day but I never picked up because every time she would leave me a cute little voice recording, it was 5 minutes long where she described how much of an embarrassment I was to the family name. Another said I was sabotaging everything she had worked for and my favorite, that I was going to end up in a dead end job at 30 and end up dying alone. Like, mom, isn't that you? Lol. Anyway, I blocked her after that and most of my family took my side. Fast forward 5 years and I'm now a paralegal with an amazing salary and perspective job. I was in the middle of joking to my coworker about how we both thought we never get into college when she asked what my GPA was, 4.2 dash. What? She exclaimed, how the EF did you struggle to get in? Before I could even respond, she picked up her phone and called her dad. My dad's a college admission officer. Sorry, but I need to know what happened. I just smiled. Daisy had always been a little quirky. Daddy, do you know his effery encounter my name? By this point, I was almost killed over from how hard I was laughing, swatting the phone to try and get her to give up. But as soon as he responded, my body went still from 2,019 to Harvard. Daisy was smiling, I wasn't. Yes, daddy, I knew your memory was still Good. Why didn't she get.

Like me and my friend could be in the most tense, awkward, silent room and all it takes is one look, just one glance, and it's over for us. I'm talking courtroom silence, funeral level seriousness. And somehow in that moment, your brain's like, what if I laughed right now for absolutely no reason? And suddenly you're fighting for your life. Your stomach is shaking, your eyes are tearing up, and you're doing that weird wheeze cough to hide it, like hoping nobody notices. And bro, your friend isn't helping. They got that stupid smirk, biting their lip, looking anywhere but at you. And now it's a battle of who breaks first. You start doing that dramatic exhale like breathing through your nostrils is gonna save you. And it's never a situation where you can laugh. It's like during class when the teachers yelling at the whole room talking about this isn't funny, this is serious! And now you're in the back like trying not to burst that laugh out, trying not to make eye contact cause you know once you do, it's over. Worse, your friend starts shaking, doing that shoulder bounce laugh that's silent. And then your laugh becomes 10 x funnier cause now you're both gasping for air but making no sound, just wheezing like broken vacuums. If someone asks what's so funny, you can't even answer cause There's nothing to explain. It's just pure forbidden laughter energy at the worst possible time. To this day, I don't know how I survived those moments. Shout out to my laugh partner. We risked our lives not to laugh out loud. Tag your laugh, buddy, cause y'all know the struggle.

Yeah, that's what I want to know. Okay. Now, I don't suppose you have her number? No, um, but when it calls, it doesn't, like, show her number or anything. It just says, you know, Holly's calling or missed call. Right. Okay, so we can't call her. We can definitely call him, though, right? Yeah, totally. Okay, so let's devise a quick plan here during the commercial break, and then when we come back, let's see what we can find out about this, okay? Okay, so we're gonna call Tony. Call Tony and. And Ashley, tell him that you are this Holly girl's sister. Oh, no, not sister. It's like, say cousin. Say I'm Holly's cousin. And we're throwing her a birthday party. So we stole her phone and we called all of her contacts. Okay? So we can invite people, but we don't want her to know about it. Oh, like a surprise. Like a surprise, buddy. Yeah, we saw that you were in her phone. Okay, and then when he says, yeah, I'm in her Phone say like. Well, we just assumed you were her new man because of all the times she's called you. Yeah.

Last month at the dog park, this couple approached me while I was throwing a tennis ball for my dog, waffle. The woman immediately started sobbing when she saw him. Her husband had his arm around her shoulders and explained through his own tears that I had their dog, their baby, who'd escaped from their backyard and they'd been searching everywhere since I'd found waffle wandering around the parking lot behind my apartment building six months ago, no collar, ribs showing through his matted fur, and figured someone had dumped him. The husband pulled out his phone, showing me dozens of photos that definitely look like waffle, playing in their backyard, swimming in their pool, sleeping on their couch. He said his name was Cooper. And when he called that name, Waffle's ears perked up and he barked, which made my stomach drop because I've been so sure he was abandoned. The wife was crying into Waffle's fur while he licked her face. And her husband pulled out his wallet and started counting hundred dollar bills. We'll give you $5,000 for him, he said, his hands shaking as he held out the cash. I know you've been taking care of him and we want to reimburse you for everything, food and vet bills in your time because you saved our baby's life. We thought our lives were over when he got out. I stared at the money feeling sick because I didn't Want their money. And I definitely didn't want to give up waffle. This dog had been my only friend through the worst breakup of my life, sleeping next to me every night when I couldn't stop crying about my ex forcing me to go outside when I wanted to rot in bed forever. But watching this woman sob while showing me more photos of their family vacations with him made my chest hurt. These people were destroyed by losing their dog. And here I was keeping him from his real family when I just been the person who found him. If they were willing to pay $5,000 just to get him back, he must mean everything to them. I told them to keep their money and just take him, that I was glad he had people who loved him that much. The woman hugged me so tight I couldn't breathe while thanking me over and over. Waffle kept looking back at me as I handed his leash to the husband, probably confused about why I wasn't coming with them. The woman coaxed him toward their car with an excited voice, telling him they were going home. I told myself he'd be happier with his real family, with a yard and another dog to play with like in their photos. The husband shook my hand and said, you're a good person. Not many people would do this. And I stood there in the empty dog park trying not to cry, but I couldn't stop myself. Waffle was such a good dog and I had no idea when we woke up that that was my last day with him. The next three weeks were exactly as horrible as I expected. I kept looking for waffle every time I opened my door, kept saving bacon scraps before remembering he wasn't there to beg for them. I bought a goldfish just to have something alive in my apartment. But it wasn't the same as having someone genuinely excited to see me exist. I started taking different routes home to avoid the dog park and threw out his bed because looking at it made me wanna scream. But I told myself at least he was back where he belonged. I kept hoping I'd hear from his family, that maybe they'd send me a picture of him all settled in, but they never did. Then yesterday, I was scrolling through next door looking for a used coffee table when I saw a post that made me drop my phone. Someone had written warning, dog kidnappers active in our neighborhood. With a blurry security camera photo attached, the post explained that criminals were stealing purebred dogs from yards and dog parks, then selling them to puppy Mills and collectors overseas for massive profits. They worked in pairs, usually a couple, and used fake sob stories about losing their beloved pet to guilt owners into giving up their dogs. My hands were shaking as I clicked on the Photo to enlarge it. Even with the terrible quality, I could see it was them, the same couple from the dog park leading someone else's German Shepherd into the same car waffle had.

I've been going to the same tattoo shop for about seven years and got work done every few months. My artist, Derek, was always really laid back and liked doing challenging pieces. He'd done my whole sleeve and my back piece and everything. You're basically my canvas at this point. He'd always joke, but this time I wanted to cover up my ex's name on my shoulder blade. I sat in his chair that Thursday afternoon and told him I wanted a black mandala over it. Derek nodded and said, easy next. I've done hundreds of these. He got the stencil ready and started setting up his machine. Everything seemed normal at first. He was talking about this new ink he'd gotten and asking about my new job and all that usual talk. The buzzing of the machine was almost relaxing. About two weeks later, though, something felt weird during the healing. I was checking it in the mirror, and the texture didn't feel right. I could feel raised bumps that spelled out letters when I ran my fingers over it. I went back to the shop that Saturday morning and showed Derek. He looked at it for maybe 10 seconds and then took a step back. His eyebrows went up, and he tilted his head to the side, staring at my shoulder blade. Let me get you in the chair under the light, he said, and his voice Was quieter than usual. He put on gloves and ran his fingers over the tattoo once, then again, then a third time. He kept tracing the same spots over and over, and then just stood there shaking his head. The name Nathan was rising through the black mandala in these raised ridges. They weren't scar or keloids, but actual raised ink pushing up through the new tattoo. Derek stepped back on the chair and asked, have you ever had any healing problems before? I told him, never. All my other tattoos healed totally flat. The ridges were only where the old name was, maybe half an inch tall for each letter, but they were really obvious and you could read. Made it through the black ink like rail. He called over the shop owner, Tony, who'd been tattooing for 35 years. Tony took one look and right away said, I need to know if you have any allergies or skin conditions. I told him, no, I was perfectly healthy. He started asking weird questions about whether the original tattoo was done somewhere sketchy, or if I'd had any reactions when I first got it. The thing was, I got the original at a good place three years ago. No problems at all when I got it. My skin had always healed great. These raised ridges made no sense. Derek kept touching it with his gloved fingers and tracing the letters. He said, in all his years and thousands of cover UPS. He'd never seen old ink push through new ink like this. Texture felt like hard plastic under the skin. Totally different from normal scar tissue. Derek was really confused and said, look, I think we should try going deeper with even thicker black. I figured, why not? Maybe it just needed more ink. He went deeper this time and really packed the ink in there. The whole shop was watching. Now other artists kept coming over between their clients because everyone wanted to see this weird thing happening with my skin. Someone said maybe it was the type of ink that was used originally, but Derek checked his records, and it was the same.

I've been keeping this notebook for six years, and my girlfriend had no clue until last week. She always said I never opened up emotionally, but honestly, I just thought guys weren't supposed to talk about all the little things they notice. Growing up, my dad forgot everyone's birthday. My mom couldn't remember who liked what food. Their fights were brutal because nobody paid attention to anyone. I swore I'd never be that type of boyfriend. So in college, I started writing stuff down about whoever I was dating. Not weird stalker stuff, just normal things. Like how Ashley preferred hot chocolate when it rained, but iced coffee when it was sunny. Or how Jessica's voice got higher when she was nervous about something. When I met Mia three years ago, the notebook got way more detailed. I wrote down everything. How she stirred her cereal exactly seven times before eating it. How she hummed the same tune when she was happy. How her left eyebrow twitched right before she'd start laughing at something. Every few weeks, I'd add new stuff, like how she only wore her lucky socks on job interview days. Or how she needed exactly eight minutes of silence when she got home from work before she could handle talking. I wrote down that she liked her apartment at exactly 72 degrees, not 71 or 73. That she always ordered extra pickles but never ate them. That she got cranky. If she didn't eat something by 11:00am, but never admitted she was hungry, the notebook helped me figure out when to give her space and when to push her to talk about stuff, when to play upbeat music, and when she needed something sad. I knew she was stressed when she started reorganizing her bookshelf, so I'd order her favorite Thai food before she even realized she was hungry. When she was upset, she'd clean the bathroom obsessively, so I'd run her a bath afterward. None of this felt calculated or weird to me. It just seemed like paying attention. But I never told her about it because it sounded super intense when I thought about explaining it. Like, hey, hey, babe, I've been documenting your behavior patterns for three years. Doesn't exactly sound romantic. Plus, guys don't really talk about this stuff with each other. I figured she'd think I was some kind of control freak or something. Last Tuesday, she was cleaning our home office while I was at work. She called me freaking out, asking why I had a notebook with her name on it hidden behind my desk. I panicked, thinking she'd found something embarrassing, but she said she hadn't opened it yet. She was waiting for me to get home to explain. The drive home felt like forever. I kept imagining her thinking I was documenting her flaws or planning to break up with her or something crazy. When I got there, she was sitting On the

Elliot leaned in so close our breaths mingled and asked, how do I get close to your best friend? Elliot was the kind of gorgeous that made girls walk into lockers, but he sat there looking genuinely lost. I've never been on a date, he admitted. I almost laughed because he'd had at least three Valentine's offers this year alone. You literally have girls throwing themselves at you, I said. He shrugged. Sure, but it's different when I'm the one doing the chasing. I just freeze. I want this proposal to go well. That's when I realised he wasn't playing dumb. He actually didn't understand. He was attractive enough to where planning a proposal wasn't even necessary. But then again, the girl he wanted to take was none other than the most beautiful, full, talented, intelligent girl in the school. My best friend, Bian, with green eyes and light brown hair and an acceptance letter to Yale. There was nothing missing from her. Elliot slid over a small envelope. Here's my bride. I almost started hyperventilating. Comic Con weekend tickets and a free hotel. Holy Mother of all! I shook his hand enthusiastically. Three weeks. I'll teach you everything in three weeks. First week we studied the basics. After school, I taught him to how give compliments without sounding like he was reading from a script. Notice the small things, I said. New earrings if she looks tired. If She changed her hair. He was clumsy at first. Great haircut. You look pretty beautiful. I burst into laughter while he glared back. Compliments aren't about the adjectives you use. It's the heart, the sound, the honesty. He nodded, then looked me in the eyes. I like the way your eyes get brighter when you talk about something you love. My face flushed as he grinned. That's good. I managed. Say that for Vianne. The practice continued, and by the end of the week he was a complimenting machine, and I was immune to his one liners. Well, almost immune. By week two we moved on to actual romancing. We met up for a picnic at a popular dating spot, became competitive at bowling, and hung out at his place to watch movies. In the evening we practiced slow dancing in the garage, stepping on each other's toes for fun. It's a pretty great. I don't know why I kept freezing up before, he said, spinning me around. That's because most people our age do way more on dates. I made kissy sounds in his ear, and he jumped back, staring daggers at me for teasing him. I grinned as he helped me back up. Let's practice slow dancing, too, he suggested, slipping his arms to my waist, carefully making the heart of my chest pound wildly. Is this okay? He breathed against my hair. I could barely breathe, let alone answer. The night before the proposal, I helped him Pick out his outfit and style his hair exactly the way beyond preferred. Do I look good? For a second I forgot how to speak. You're like a prince, I breathed, and quickly added, that's what Vianne would say. We did one final practice run in the park. He strung up fairy lights and held onto my hand, gently stroking the back of it with his thumb. I stared up at him, at the large brown eyes sprinkled with golden speckles from the fairy lights, and smiled. He leaned in slowly, but just as I closed my eyes, he paused, dropping my hands, and took a step back. Vianne's going to love this. Reality crashed back hard. My heart squeezed painfully while I forced myself to agree. I think you'll do perfectly, I reminded him. Comic con was the same weekend as prom. No, he said. Thanks for bullying me. I mean teaching me. He winked and pulled me into one last tight hug. Enjoy Comic Con. I squeezed back. Enjoy prom. That Friday, the whole school watched as Elliot approached Vian at lunch with flowers and a giant proposal sign. He executed everything perfectly, just like we'd practiced. Speech, the timing, even the way he held the flowers. Vianne squealed and said yes! While everyone filmed it. The cafeteria erupted in cheers while my heart broke into a million pieces. How could I have let myself fall for a guy who was clear from the start he wanted Vianne? Not me. Elliot's eyes found mine in the crowd for just a second before Vianne pulled him into a hug. I quickly wiped away tears and walked off. I left school early, claiming I felt sick, which was

My mom had me when she was just 13. She was a child herself, but she tried her best. I still remember the day my second grade teacher made us draw our families. Other kids drew stick figures of dads and siblings. I just drew mom. When I got home, Mrs. Peters had written incomplete assignment in red pen across the top. Mom looked at my drawing, then at the red Mark, without a word, she took a marker and drew a giant circle around me and her. This, he said, is a complete family. By middle school, I was a straight a student. Mom would tape my report cards to our fridge like trophies. She'd come home from double shifts at the diner, her uniform stained with grease and still help me with homework. Education is your ticket out, she'd say. Then Cassie Mitchell happened. She cornered me by the lockers surrounded by her friends. Hey, charity case. Is it true your mom was a pregnant middle schooler, but you don't even know who your dad is? They were right. I didn't. The whispers followed me everywhere. Trailer trash, they'd say just loud enough for me to hear. Your mom's a SLT. I started skipping school. When my straight A's turned to F's, school called. Mom took a rare day off from the diner. I expected her to be furious. We couldn't afford lost wages, but When she got home, she just sat beside me on our porch steps, still in her waitress uniform. What's happening, baby? She asked, her voice tired but gentle. I stared at the concrete. Those, it's at school, I finally whispered. They say I'm nothing but a mistake, that I ruined your life. Mom was quiet for so long, I thought she might have fallen asleep. Then she grabbed my shoulders, her eyes suddenly fierce. Listen to me, she said, her voice shaking. Everyone in this town expected me to fail to give you up. My own parents threw me out, but you're the best decision I ever made. She wiped her eyes. So tomorrow we're going to show them exactly what we're made of. The next morning, mom, transform.

After the school shooting at the nearby elementary school, three children were shot dead. One of them was 10 year old Amelia, who bled out in Miss Lee's arms. And two months later, she became my 8th grade history teacher. At first, she seemed normal, just wanted to keep us safe. She locked our door even during class, and memorized every parent's face. When the intercom crackled, she'd freeze for a second before continuing. But as winter turned to spring, Miss Lee's Protection shifted into something scary. In place of our usual classes, we had special safety games where we had to hide in assigned spots around the room as fast as possible. She timed us and said we needed to beat her old class's record. My spot was the coat closet, which felt too small, but Miss Lee swore it was the safest place. The closet saved someone once, she told me. Her eyes looked far away when she said it. The games were kind of fun until Miss Lee started staring at my friend Isabella during them. Isabella had brown hair and freckles, just like the girl in the newspaper photo. Sometimes Miss Lee would call Isabella Amelia, then look confused. I'd constantly hear her whisper, 22 new chances while counting us as more time passed. The more she talked about her old class and how she should have been harder on them. When they laughed during drills, we tried to Tell ourselves it was just part of the process. But I knew none of this was normal when she interrupted class one day to show us her lock screen. It was a photo of her old class. She pointed to each child and told us their names. When she got to Amelia, she started hysterically sobbing. She could barely speak, but even in that state, she made us memorize where Amelia sat and how she hid. Amelia was quiet, I remember her saying, but not quiet enough. From there, I was forced to watch as Miss Lee practically descended into madness. I could tell something terrible was coming. But nothing could have prepared me for that Friday in May. Miss Lee's hands shook so bad she dropped her coffee. She checked her phone constantly and whispered, next time I'll be better. To Amelia's photo. She made us practice hiding six times before 10:00, and her voice sounded strangled whenever she spoke. Today you show me you can survive, she said. Today you prove you're better than my old class. Those were the worst words she had ever said. She unlocked the side door, which was against every school rule. She told us this was our most important drill ever, as she positioned Isabella in the corner, exactly like in the old photos. We had to be perfect or we'd end up in a grave, just like Amelia, she warned us. At 10:00am, the hallway exploded with sound. Gunshots echoed off The walls making my ears ring, Miss Lee screamed.

A parent turned to me and asked, did your ex husband have a beard? I giggled nervously. Um, yeah, why? No, no, no, no, no, she suddenly screamed while walking as far away from me as possible. I just laughed because moms can be so weird sometimes. But the next day, my daughter came home from school crying. Mommy, Leah said her mom said she can't talk to me anymore. Leah was her best friend. I immediately took out my phone and texted her mom asking if everything was okay. No response. I texted Emily's mom, one of the other girls in her trio. Still nothing. I had just managed to calm my baby girl down when the pizza arrived. Usually our delivery guy is the Apache 5,000, but tonight he just set the box on my doorstep and practically ran away. George, you forgot your tip, I yelled, waving a 20. He just kept going. The next few days were insane. At my daughter's soccer practice, Helen saw me walking towards her and held her phone to her ear. No one had even called her. Helen, what's going on? She mouth, sorry and walked faster. We used to complain about our husbands together. Parents were whispering and showing each other something on their phones. When I walked by, they quickly put them away. By Thursday, my daughter was refusing to go to school. I moved my desk away from everyone else. The teacher Said it was for space reasons, but there's like 10 feet between me and Leah now. I tried to bring her to the hairdresser to cheer her up, but when the woman saw me coming, she closed early. No apology. Just flipped the sign and pulled the blinds. My phone buzzed. It was my landlord. Heard what happened. So sorry, rent can wait this month. This was the same man who charged me a 50 dollar inconvenience fee when I paid rent at 12:00am instead of midnight. Then the birthday party, Emily's sleepover. My daughter found out that everyone was invited except her. She was having such a bad panic attack that I had to call a hospital. Mom, what did I do? Emily is my best friend. Enough was enough. I called the school office. Something is happening to my daughter. She's being systematically excluded and I need answers right now. The counselor called back within an hour, but her voice was off, like she was choosing every word carefully. Missus Callahan, we just wanted to check in about your home environment. Is everything safe? Anyone new spending time around your daughter? What? What are you even asking me? I think it's best if we discuss this in person. Can you, you come in tomorrow morning? No. You'll tell me right now why my daughter is being tortured. Long pause. The principal will explain everything tomorrow. Beep. She hung up. Then at eleven PM, an email from my gym. Membership terminated effective immediately. I've been going there for five years. The owner knew me by name. I was trying to figure out what to do when my daughter crawled into my bed at 2:00am sobbing, Mommy, am I ugly? It took everything in me not to burst into tears. The lunch lady wouldn't look at me today. She just pointed at my tray. I finally caved Saturday morning. I found myself walking towards the principal's office while being escorted by a security guard. Other parents there for Saturday sports held their kids against the walls as we passed. One mom literally shielded her son with her body like we were dangerous. In his office, the principal locked the door behind us. The click was so loud in the silence, he walked to the windows and twisted the blinds shut. My daughter grabbed my hand tighter. Please sit down. I'll stand. What is this about? He sat at his desk, fingers hovering over his keyboard, then pulled them back. Mister Griffin, you're scaring me. Missus Callahan, he was looking at his screen, not at me. When did you last speak to your ex husband? Christmas. Why? And you haven't been in contact since then? No communication at all? No. We exchanged texts about.

She returned 6 years later to find I divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years Max. Don't change the locks. He left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation to our 8 year olds. That first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decisions. No more walking on eggshells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curveball in our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year 2 brought unexpected changes without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I'd been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd forgotten how to Enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually, she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her Bonus Mom, their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes and tucked them in at night. Year 5 was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and, and being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year 6, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor role. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward after three Years of zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from the living room. Through the window, we watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck, pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she owned the place.

So I chose to tear away from him what he thought was untouchable, his grandfather. The old man was guilty of nothing except existing in his lineage and having this little bastard with him. His wrinkled skin, his fragile breath, he embodied innocence. And that's precisely what made my act more cruel. I took it, I destroyed it, piece by piece, until only a suffocating silence remained. And then the unthinkable happened. Like a curse born of my actions, his body began to swell, to swell with an alien life. The grandfather, despite his age, now carried within him an impossible pregnancy, an abomination, a cursed child conceived in pain and despair. When his grandson discovered what was happening, his eyes filled with horror. I looked him straight in the eyes and whispered, did you wanna laugh? Look, now your grandfather carries within him the proof of my vengeance. And that laughter will haunt you until your death. That day, he understood that some jokes are worth more than a Smile. They breed monsters.

My brother Jake, has this girlfriend named Becca who literally cannot stand not being the center of attention for 5 minutes. Every family dinner, every holiday, every gathering, she finds a way to make it about her. Last Thanksgiving, she announced she was pregnant right when my dad was about to carve the Turkey. Turns out she wasn't even pregnant. Just wanted to see everyone's reactions. So when I was planning my wedding to my fiance, Ryan, I knew I had to do something about the Becca situation. This was going to be my one day, the one day that was supposed to be about me and Ryan starting our life together. I called Jake about three months before the wedding. Hey, so about the wedding, I started. I need to ask you something kind of awkward. What's up, he said. And I could hear him eating cereal in the background. I, I really don't want Becca there. I know that sounds harsh, but she always makes everything about herself and I just can't deal with that stress on my wedding day. The line went quiet for like 10 seconds and Jake exploded. Are you serious right now you're uninviting my girlfriend from your wedding? I'm not uninviting her because she was never invited in the first place. The invitation was just for you. That's the same thing. We've been together for two years. She's basically family. I. Tried to explain that it wasn't personal, that I just wanted one drama free day. But Jake wasn't having it. He said if Becca couldn't come, then he wouldn't come either. I told him that was his choice. Hope think he changed his mind? He didn't. But here's where it gets crazy. The day of my wedding, I'm getting my makeup done in the bridal suite when my cousin Madison bursts in. Uh, you need to see this, he says, shoving her phone in my face. It's Becca's Instagram story. She's posted like 15 videos of herself getting all dressed up, doing her makeup, picking out jewelry. The caption on the last one says, can't wait to celebrate love today with a bunch of heart emojis and the location tagged as our wedding venue. My heart drops. He's coming anyway. Madison nods. Jake's outside right now arguing with your dad about it. He says he changed his mind and decided to bring her. I'm standing there in my wedding dress, half my makeup done and I have to deal with.

My brother Ryan was marrying this absolute nightmare of a woman named Brianna. Nobody in our family could stand her, but Ryan was completely blind to it. She was controlling from day one. She told my mom she couldn't wear navy to the wedding because that was her colour. She demanded our family pay for all the flowers, which cost like $3,000. I asked if I could bring my two kids to the wedding. She said absolutely not because children would ruin her perfect day. But the worst part was when we found out she hadn't even sent an invitation to our grandma Helen. When my mom asked why, Brianna just shrugged and said grandma was boring and would probably fall asleep during the ceremony anyway. I was furious. Grandma Helen was 82 and had basically raised Ryan after our dad died. She taught him how to drive, helped him with homework every night, and even paid for his college textbooks when money was tight. When grandma found out she wasn't invited, she didn't yell or cry like I expected. She just sat quietly in her kitchen chair, nodding slowly. Then she looked up at me with this calm smile and said, well, we'll see about that, won't we? The wedding day came and I was dreading every minute of it. The venue was actually this gorgeous old mansion that had been in our family for decades. Grandma had let Ryan use it for free because she wanted his wedding to be special. I was standing there watching Brianna boss around the photographers when suddenly I heard gasps from the guests. There was Grandma Helen walking up the main entrance in the most stunning gold gown I'd ever seen. She looks like royalty. She was carrying this leather folder under her arm and had the biggest smile on her face. Brianna spotted her immediately and marched over, her face turning bright red. What are you doing here? You weren't invited, Brianna screamed loud enough for everyone to hear. The entire wedding party stopped what they were doing to watch. Grandma didn't even.

Allison couldn't let anyone else have their moment. At our cousin Jamie's beach wedding, she grabbed the mic during toasts to announce her divorce. During our cousin Alex's first dance, she loudly told everyone at our table she was pregnant. At my best friend's reception, she stood on a chair during the cutting to reveal she was moving to Paris. That moment of chaos at her reception was nothing compared to what awaited me three months later at my wedding. Everything was going perfectly until the speeches started. My maid of honor was halfway through her beautiful toast when Allison stood up. She clinked her glass dramatically and walked to the front. She took the microphone right out of my friend's hand. Sorry, but I have something important to share while everyone's here, she announced. She pulled her boyfriend, Craig, up beside her. She told the entire room they were adopting a baby from Korea. My guests erupted in confused congratulations while my maid of honor stood there holding her speech cards uselessly. The rest of my reception became the Allison show. People kept coming up to her for details about the adoption. Someone started a collection for baby supplies using the envelope box meant for our cards. The photographer spent 20 minutes doing an impromptu photo shoot of her and Craig. My mom found me crying in the bathroom and told me I was being dramatic. She's just excited about becoming a mother, she said. You should be happy for family. My aunt agreed that Allison was just enthusiastic about sharing good news. A few months later, at Sunday dinner, Allison announced her wedding date. She went on and on about her vintage Hollywood glamour theme. She'd already booked the historic Grandview Manor downtown. Frank sat there nodding while she showed everyone her Pinterest boards. I want it to be absolutely perfect, she gushed. No interruptions or distractions. Just all eyes on us for once. The irony nearly choked me, but I smiled and said it sounded lovely. That night, I started planning. Allison's fatal flaw was her complete blindness to her own behavior. She genuinely believed she was just sharing joy. She couldn't understand why anyone would mind. She also had zero ability to handle competition for attention. I reached out to my college theater friends first. My roommate Macy ran an improv group that specialized in flash mobs and public performances. When I explained my idea, she literally cackled with delight. Within a week, I had 12 performers committed to the cause. The tricky part was getting them into the wedding. I studied Allison's guest list when she left it at my mom's house. Several couples had generic plus one RSVPs. Macy's performers could pose as dates for single guests. I knew. I reached out to these friends and explained the situation. Every single one wanted to help. After hearing About my wedding the wedding was as over the top as expected. Allison had seven bridesmaids and released doves during the ceremony. The reception ballroom dripped with crystals and white roses. My performers were scattered perfectly throughout the room as planned. Guests everything started during dinner service. At exactly 6:30, Macy stood up at table 4 and let out a shriek. Her fake boyfriend was on one knee between the salad and soup courses. The whole room turned to watch as she said yes. He slipped a costume jewelry ring on her finger. Allison's smile froze, but she started clapping along with everyone else. At 6:45 during the champagne toast.

For as long as I could remember, my younger brother Garrett had been insecure about being weak and scrawny. The LaCrosse team would shove him into lockers daily, calling him twig boy. The worst was when he couldn't open a water bottle at lunch and his crush Emily laughed, asking the guy next to her, Garrett's too weak. He needs a man to help him. I always felt bad for him. But the day he discovered one punch man, everything changed. He burst into my room holding his phone, showing me Saitama's transformation. Look, he was just like me. A weak, bullied nobody. Then he did the simple training and became the strongest hero alive. I was just happy he found something that gave him hope. The very next morning, Garrett started Saitama's routine religiously. 100 push UPS, 100 sit UPS, 100 squats, a 10 kilometer run every single day. Within two months, his arms showed actual definition and his chest filled out his shirts. The LaCrosse team stopped shoving him around completely, while mom bought him protein powder and dad installed a pull up bar. Look at my dedicated boy, she'd beam at dinner. When he shaved his head bald, the school counselor pulled me aside. Whatever is motivating him, it's working. His grades are up, confidence through the roof. Even I was impressed when he bench pressed his body. Wait. For the first time. The best part was Emily Starting to notice watching him do pull UPS after school and asking about his anime workout, he'd flex and quote, Sidima, I'm just a guy who's a hero for fun. We all laughed because he was finally becoming the person he wanted to be. But as months passed, things shifted when Garrett demanded everyone call him Sidima. Refusing to respond to Garrett anymore, teachers got email signed Sidima, while he begged mom to legally change his name. When you're 18, she said, this is just a phase. Soon after, he quit soccer. Because Sidima trained alone, and his knuckles stayed permanently stabbed. From concrete walls in our basement. I'm removing my limiters, he explained, wrapping them in bloody gauze. Now deadlifting 300 pounds, his frame had exploded from 130 to 200 pounds of pure muscle, with veins sneaking up his arms like cables. When I tried talking to him about my concerns, he brushed me off. You're getting too intense about this whole point is to push past human limits. He showed me his training journal, filled with detailed power rankings, strength measurements, and notes about breaking through, with page after page of sidemen quotes highlighted in yellow. After he passed out doing squats, mom attempted an intervention. Honey, you need rest days. Tama never rested. That's why he transcended. He stormed out to run his 10 kilometer run at midnight. Then the mall incident started a week later, when he began picking fights, asking random guys to test his Power level until security banned him after the third confrontation. His fist now bore a tattoo reading one punch in bold letters across the knuckles. Six months into his transformation, Garrett looked like a bodybuilder who'd swallowed another bodybuilder. At 220 pounds of carved muscle with shoulders so wide he turned sideways through doorways. We were driving to get groceries on a normal Tuesday morning when he saw a cop conducting a routine traffic stop on the shoulder. Pull over, he said with deadly calm in his voice. What? No, we need to pull over. He grabbed the wheel. This is it, my moment. I pulled over with shaking hands as he got out and walked toward the officer with purpose. The cop immediately tensed with his hand moving to his whole

I even practiced using the right forks at dinner by watching YouTube videos late at night. But Nathan wasn't like his family. He drove a beat up Volkswagen and wore the same three hoodies on rotation. When he found out I was returning his gifts, he started buying me practical things instead. Grocery store gift cards, gas money, nursing scrubs. He never made me feel small. His mother, Andrea, was different. She'd ask questions like, what country club did your family belong to? Or which prep school did you attend? When I admitted I went to public school, she'd purse her lips and change the subject. Once she accidentally spilled red wine on my only nice dress at a family dinner. Things got worse when Nathan proposed. Andrea cornered me in the kitchen during our engagement party. How much? She asked, pulling out her checkbook. Name your Price to walk away. You clearly only want his money. I was hurt, but stood my ground. I love your son. I'm not going anywhere. Two weeks later, she showed up at the diner where I worked, ordering coffee and staying for my entire shift. She left religious pamphlets about marrying within your class with her 10 cent tip. My hands shook so bad I dropped three plates that day. Then came the custody battle. Nathan's cousin Amy had lost her kids to social services after a drug relapse. She was rich, well connected and desperate to adopt. But no agency would approve her with her history. That's when she found Tommy. Tommy was a sweet six year old boy from my old neighborhood. Mom was my regular at the diner, a single mother working three jobs. When she got sick with cancer, she asked me to help find Tommy a good home. I promised I would. Nathan and I applied to adopt Tommy. We had a stable home, good jobs. I'd finish nursing school by then, and so much love to give. The social worker loved us. Tommy would come for weekend visits and we'd build blanket forts and make homemade pizzas together. But Andrea and Amy had other plans. Hired expensive lawyers, claiming we were financially unstable. They dug up my father's old Duis, my mother's welfare records. They painted me as white trash trying to climb the social ladder through Nathan. The final blow came when they Offered Tommy's dying mother $50,000 to change her recommendation to Amy. She was drowning in medical bills. She took the deal. I was destroyed. But Nathan surprised everyone. He walked into the final court hearing and announced he was giving

In my family, we had something called Health Day. Every Saturday morning at 9:00am sharp, we'd finish breakfast and dad would already have the basement ready with his white coat on and all his medical equipment laid out on metal trays in the basement. Our mom would kiss our foreheads before sending us down one by one. Then came the examinations. Thorough inspections of every inch of our bodies while he muttered medical terms and scribbled in thick blue binders. He'd make us stand naked under the bright lights while he circled us slow, his gloved fingers pressing into our skin, checking what he called abnormalities. He called it preventative care. I dreaded it. Every single week. The rule was you couldn't flinch or complain or you'd start over from the beginning. The strangest part? We weren't allowed to mention health day at school. Not to teachers, not to friends. I only realised in middle school how weird that was. How other kids just went to pediatricians once a year, not secret basement clinics every week. But the worst part was the special examinations. If dad found something concerning during the regular check, you'd get called down. On week nights, he had this small locked room with bright lights and an exam table with stirrups. The metal was always cold and he'd spend what felt like hours with his instruments, documenting every detail while telling us to relax and breathe. He said it Was for comprehensive assessment. The kid. I was terrified. I'd count the ceiling tiles over and over. But dad said fear meant you were taking your health seriously. When I got older, I started questioning everything. Why did we need weekly exams when no one else did? Why did mom drink before every health day? I remember once, at 14, I asked if I could skip it for Rachel's sleepover. Dad gripped my wrist and stared at me with these desperate eyes. Health Day is the only thing keeping you safe, he said. That's when I knew something was deeply wrong. Rachel's family had annual checkups, vaccinations, schedules, growth charts on the fridge. No basement procedures, no locked rooms, no binders documenting their bodies. Just normal healthcare. I finally refused to go downstairs when I turned 16. Dad went ballistic, screaming that I was ungrateful and didn't understand the dangers. Mom just stood there shaking. He locked me in my room and said I couldn't leave until I submitted to a full examination the next morning. Mom slipped me $20 under the door and whispered to use the window. When I came back that night, dad acted like nothing had happened. He just asked if I was ready for my examination, like he hadn't imprisoned me the night before. That's when I started planning. Still, the whole thing ate at me. Why was dad so obsessed with our health when he wasn't even a doctor? Where did he get all That equipment. Three months later, I told my health teacher everything. Missus Patterson kept her face very still as I explained our Saturday routine. She said she needed to make a phone call. I knew what that meant. She came back with the principal. Then the police came. Then child services. They took us out of class one by one. Just like health day. Except this time, we didn't go home. I'll never forget Dad's face when they arrested him. Not angry, just broken. I was protecting them, he kept saying. The officers found the binders. Dozens

When she said I didn't understand her loss. My sister in law Kelly had her first miscarriage about six months ago. It was devastating. I get that. The whole family rallied around her and my brother Jake, bringing casseroles and giving them space to grieve. But then she started acting like she was the only person who'd ever lost a baby. Started small at family dinners, she'd make comments about how nobody understood what real loss felt like. When my cousin Amanda talked about her dog dying, Kelly rolled her eyes and said that's not the same thing at all. When my mom mentioned missing my grandpa who died last year, Kelly literally scoffed and said, you got to say goodbye to him. Though the worst part was how she treated me. I've been married to my husband Chris for eight years and we don't have kids yet. Kelly started making these passive aggressive comments about how lucky I was to not have to worry about these things, how I couldn't possibly understand what she was going through. Last weekend was my nephew's birthday party. Kelly seemed okay during most of it, playing with the kids and laughing at their jokes. But then my brother's friend brought up how his wife was pregnant and Kelly's whole mood shifted. She got quiet and started picking out her food. Later when we were in the kitchen cleaning up, Kelly started talking about how Hard it was seeing pregnant women everywhere. I tried to be supportive, telling her I understood how triggering that must be. That's when she snapped. No, you don't understand, she said, her voice getting louder. You have no idea what it's like to lose a baby. You've never even been pregnant. You don't know what real loss feels like. Something inside me just broke. I've been holding this in for years, keeping it private because Chris and I decided we didn't want the.

I hated the idea of my 17 year old daughter dating anyone. But when she brought home this boy named Pete, I lost it. He had a motorcycle, tattoos, and that smug smile that made me want to run his name through the system. I made it my mission to break them up. I'd randomly show up at places they hung out, flash my badge around, and remind Pete that I knew how to make bodies disappear. But this kid never flinched. He just smile and say, have a good day, sir. When he came for dinner the first time, I placed my gun on the table next to my plate. My wife kicked me under the table, but I didn't care. Pete just looked at it and said, nice Glock 19, sir. My uncle's got the same one at his security firm. That's when the real torture began. I started making him come over every weekend to bond. I'd have him help me with the most backbreaking chores I could think of. Reshingling the roof in July, digging out a tree stump by hand, moving every piece of furniture in the house to steam clean the carpets. This kid never complained. He'd show up at 7:00am sharp, already wearing work clothes. Even brought his own work gloves. When I try to wear him down with endless tasks, he just say, what's next, Sir, one Saturday I had him helping me rebuild the deck. I was being extra harsh, making him redo boards that were perfectly fine. Around noon, my daughter brought us water. As she walked away, I caught Pete watching her. But it wasn't the way most teenage boys looked at girls. He had this soft smile, like he was watching something precious. I decided to test him. You know she's way out of your league, right? He wiped his forehead and said, oh, I know, sir. Trust me, I know. That's why I'm here every weekend, letting you test me. Cause she's worth it. I was about to respond when we heard screaming from inside the house. We both ran in to find my wife on the kitchen floor. She'd

I used to work as a prison guard and one day our warden decided it would be a good idea to bring his 10 year old daughter in so she could see where dad works. He left her alone in his office for just a minute. When she wandered out, he found her 10 minutes later in one of the corridors bleeding out from her head with the fly on her pants undone. Watching him clutch her against his chest and hold her lifeless body repeating daddy's got you, sweetheart for hours was a sight I'll never forget. From that moment on, he became obsessed with finding out who did this. He didn't even take a day off from work, just came in next morning off, no sleep, spent the whole day grilling every prisoner in guard. He offered bribes, reduce sentences, special privileges, anything for information. I remember watching him break down between interviews then slam his head into the wall repeatedly just so the physical pain could momentarily drown out the emotional one for long enough to conduct the next interview. He grounded everybody he thought gave suspicious answers and threatened them with solitary confinement, beatings, firings for guards. He even went as far as forcing a prisoner to wear a wire during yard to hopefully catch an admission, threatening that prisoner with an extra two years to his sentence if he didn't wear it. Unfortunately, his interviews didn't get him an Answer, so he started becoming more harsh. Two and a half weeks after the death, he came into work hammered and grabbed me by the shoulders, telling me today was the beginning of the end. He then rounded up all the prisoners and announced to them that until the truth about who did it comes out, they would only be getting fed every second day. The backlash was brutal and the warden took that as a sign that the people protesting were guilty, got a hold of everyone who stepped out of line and ordered us, the guards, to beat them. Some guards, including myself, felt bad and didn't want to. But he threatened our jobs, saying if we're hesitating, then that means one of us must have called his daughter. He'd pace her.

How has it gone for you? When my wife Rachel and I adopted Devon at six years old, they told us she had mild trust issues. What they didn't tell us was that she'd been returned by three families already. Devon showed up at our house with one tiny suitcase and a backpack that first night. I watched her through the doorway as she carefully laid out all her clothes on the bed. She folded each piece perfectly, put it back in the suitcase, and zipped it up. Then she slept on top of the covers, fully dressed. I thought maybe she was just nervous, but weeks went by, and that suitcase never got unpacked. She'd take out one outfit each morning, wear it all day, then fold it back up at night. Her closet stayed completely empty. Rachel tried everything. New sheets with unicorns on them, a night light shaped like a butterfly. We even let her pick out paint for her room walls. She chose white. Just plain white like before. One morning, I found her in the kitchen at 5 a m. Making her own breakfast. Toast with no butter, just dry bread. When I asked why she was up so early, she said, I didn't want to bother you guys. Sometimes people get mad when kids wake them up. That broke my heart. Rachel and I had been trying for years to have kids. We dreamed About Saturday morning pancakes and bedtime stories. But Devin acted like she was living in a hotel, not a home. The real wake up call came three months later. I got home from work and heard crying upstairs. Found Devin sitting on her bed, holding that stupid suitcase in her lap. What's wrong, sweetheart? She looked up at me with these huge brown eyes and said, I heard you and Rachel fighting last night about money. I know kids cost a lot. I can go back to Miss Janet tomorrow if you want. Miss Janet was her social worker. My throat got tight. Rachel and I had been arguing about our car payment. Nothing to do with Devon at all. Devon, we weren't fighting about you. We love having you here. She just shrugged. That's what the Johnson said, too. And the Millers. They all said I was special. Until I wasn't anymore. That night, Rachel and I sat up talking until 3 a m. We realized Devon wasn't just scared of us leaving her. She was waiting for us to leave her. She'd been through this routine before. Nice family, happy faces. Then back to foster care. When things got tough the next day, I had an idea. I went to the hardware store and bought the biggest picture frame they had, like three feet wide. Then Rachel and I spent the whole weekend taking photos. Devon at breakfast, Devon watching TV, Devon playing with our dog Charlie. Just Normal, boring family stuff. We printed out all the pictures and arranged them in the frame. Beach trips we took her on. Movie nights on the couch. Devon's first day at her new school. Even the bad pictures where someone was making a weird face.

My parents were so worried about me dating a skater boy. They couldn't imagine he'd be the reason I'm still alive today. A few nights ago, my parents found out about my skater boyfriend, Gregus, when his message popped up on my screen at dinner. I love you, too. Who the heck are you talking to? My mom shouted, glaring the screen of my phone. You're 14. No dating until you're 30. We were very clear. Dad pulled up Gregus's Instagram on his own phone. A skateboarder? Really? This is who you're risking your future for? I tried to reason with them, but they refused to listen and forced me to block him everywhere, right there, over dinner. You'll thank us when you're in college, mom said while I sobbed. My friends tried passing messages between us at school, but my parents found out and threatened to call their parents. Eventually, everyone gave up, except for Gregus. Gregus showed up mysteriously in my valorant. Hey, Mel. It's been a while, he said, his voice breaking. I miss you, Mel. I know we're not supposed to talk, but let's at least play like we used to. We started meeting in the lobbies every day after that, just playing and chatting about normal things. School friends, my strict parents. He never once tried to convince me to sneak around or meet up in person. He never complained about my Parents or tried to turn me against them. When I vent about how unfair they were being, he'd actually defend them. Sometimes they're just scared, Once my older sister got mixed up with some bad people in high school. Parents get paranoid. He still cared about me in all the ways that mattered. When I failed my chemistry test because I couldn't focus, he spent three hours teaching me balancing equations over discord. When my grandmother got sick, he stayed up until 3:00am just listening to me cry. You can always reach me here, he promised. I don't care what time it is. Mom almost got us once when she walked by while discord was open. I clicked to my game lobby just in time. Homework break? She asked. I nodded and switched back to my essay, my heart pounding so hard I thought she'd hear it after she left Greg's message. Maybe we should stop. I don't want to get you in trouble. But I couldn't lose him again. He was the only person who I could rely on. And thank god I didn't lose him, because a couple of days later, my friend Sarah and I got caught up in some shady business. It was supposed to be a normal Saturday night sleepover. Her parents went out for their anniversary, leaving us to watch movies and eat junk food. I was on the phone messaging Gregus on discord when Sarah's older brother Joshua came home from College, completely wasted with two other friends, Sarah immediately tensed up. baby sis and baby girl, he winked. Disgusting. He and his friends sat beside us on the sofa, placing his arm over my shoulder, constantly whispering things like, I know you're not as innocent as you act, and your parents don't have to know. I pushed his face away and stood up, glaring. Can you stop? Sarah was almost crying, begging me not to make him mad. He gets mean when he's drunk. She was just ignore him and he'll pass out soon. But when Joshua grabbed my waist and tried to pull me onto his lap, I grabbed Sarah's arm and ran to the bathroom, quickly locking the door. He started pounding on it, laughing with his friends about how I was playing hard to get and needed to loosen up. Sarah hopped into the tub, hugging her knees to her chest. I. I patted my pockets, realizing I had left my phone in the living room. Soon the knocks on the door became angrier. Hitting the door harder, jiggling the handle aggressively, Sarah meekly handed me her phone.

My girlfriend Taylor and I were both 20 and things had been going pretty solid between us for about eight months. She had this stepbrother, Ethan, who was 23. And honestly, the few times I'd met him before, he seemed like a normal dude, maybe a little too friendly, but nothing that set off major alarm bells. Two weeks ago, Taylor asked if Ethan could come hang out at my place for a few hours. She said he was bringing pizza and beer and since my parents were visiting my aunt for the weekend, I figured why not? My little sister Mia is 15 and she was just gonna stay upstairs doing homework anyway. So they showed up around 7. Ethan had this huge grin and two cases of beer. We started drinking and playing video games, just, just chilling on the couch. Everything was normal for like an hour. Taylor was curled up next to me. Ethan was cracking jokes about the game and I was thinking this was actually pretty fun. Then Ethan said he needed to use the bathroom. I pointed down the hall to the one on the first floor. Taylor and I kept playing and I didn't even notice how long he'd been gone until we heard yelling upstairs. My blood went cold. Mia never yells. We both jumped up and ran upstairs and I Found my sister standing in her doorway crying, like full on sobbing. Ethan was right there in the hallway looking all flustered and red in the face. I immediately asked Mia what happened and she could barely get the words out between sobs. She said Ethan had walked into her room, even though her door was only cracked open a little. She thought maybe he was lost looking for the bathroom. So she tried to be.

My boyfriend brought his new coworker Dave, to our housewarming party last weekend. I have a 13 year old beagle named Murphy who's blind in one eye from an accident years ago and moves pretty slowly these days. He's the sweetest old guy, never bothers anyone, just likes to find a cozy spot and watch the world go by. I'd invited about 20 people over to show off our new place. Everyone was having a great time, music playing, people mingling between the kitchen and living room. Murphy had claimed his usual spot by the fireplace, occasionally getting gentle pets from guests who thought he was adorable. About an hour into the party, I realized I hadn't seen Murphy in a while. That's unusual because he never wanders far from wherever the action is. Started looking around, calling his name softly so I wouldn't alarm anyone. Finally found him locked in the laundry room, whimpering and scratching at the door. The moment I opened it, he practically collapsed into my arms, shaking. When I helped him stand, he was limping badly on his back right leg. My heart immediately started racing. Murphy's old and fragile. Any injury could be serious. I carried him back to the living room and asked everyone what happened, trying to keep my voice calm but probably failing. Most of my guests looked genuinely concerned and confused. A few people mentioned seeing him Earlier, but nothing seemed wrong. That's when Dave, who'd been standing by the beer cooler looking completely unbothered, started laughing. Oh yeah, that old dog kept get getting in my way while I was grabbing another beer, he said casually like he was talking about the weather. Kept bumping into my legs. So I gave him a little kick to move him along. No big deal. The entire room went silent. I stared at him in complete shock, not sure I'd heard correctly. You kicked my 13 year old blind dog, I asked. My voice probably getting louder than I intended. Dave just shrugged with this annoying smirk, barely touched him. He's fine. Obviously dogs need to learn boundaries anyway. Can't just let them walk all over you. My boyfriend's face went completely pale and he immediately started apologizing, clearly mortified. But I was already seeing red. Murphy was now hiding behind my legs, trembling and refusing to put weight on his injured paw. Everyone needs to leave right now, I announced to the room. Everyone except you. I pointed directly at Dave. You're staying to explain this to someone special. My guests filed out quickly, many of them shooting disgusted looks at Dave and offering to help with Murphy. My boyfriend hesitated, but I told him he needed to leave too and think about the kind and of people he brings around. Once the house cleared, I called my neighbor Jim. He's a retired police officer who absolutely adores Murphy and has a spare key to check on him when I travel for work. Jim treats Murphy like his own grand dog. Jim arrived within five minutes, still in his weak.

Now my, he wants my house. When I was 16, my gaming obsessed brother Tyler convinced my parents I was taking up too much space in our cramped three bedroom apartment. He'd been complaining for months that he needed my room for his elaborate gaming setup. My parents sat me down one evening and basically said I had two weeks to find alternative living arrangements. The reasoning, I was almost 17, practically an adult and Tyler needed space to pursue his passion in gaming and they genuinely believed he was going to become the next big twitch star. I was devastated but had nowhere to go. My girlfriend Emma's parents noticed I'd been spending more time at their house and eventually asked what was going on. When I explained the situation, her mom immediately said I could stay stay with them as long as I needed, no questions asked. Emma and I got serious fast. Living under the same roof will do that to a relationship. When we turned 19, I proposed with a ring. I'd saved six months for working overtime every weekend. Parents were thrilled. They basically raised me for two years anyway and considered me their son. At 23, we finally had enough saved for a down payment on a small two bedroom house, nothing fancy. We spent every weekend renovating, learning YouTube tutorials, making mistakes and fixing them. Meanwhile, Tyler was still living with my parents in his gaming paradise. He Dropped out of community college after one semester, claiming his streaming career was about to take off. College was just holding him back. Three years later, he was still grinding away at maybe five viewers on a good day, sleeping until two PM, gaming until 4:00am, ordering Doordash with my parents money. My parents occasionally texted generic holiday messages or shared Facebook posts about family, but otherwise, we had zero relationship. Last month, my mom showed up at my house completely unannounced. I hadn't seen her.

Maya was the kind of teacher who got off on making students miserable. In AP history, he'd lean over your desk during tests, breathing coffee breath down your neck while tapping his pen on your paper, just to throw you off. And when he handed back essays drowned in red ink, he'd always had his favourite line in the real world, this wouldn't fly. I spent all junior year counting down to summer, marking days off my calendar like a prisoner, thinking I'd finally be free of his polyester blazers and power trips. So when I walked into the driver's ed two weeks later and saw him sitting behind the instructor's desk, my stomach dropped like a stone. Where do I turn? I asked during our first lesson, gripping the wheel nervously. You don't turn unless I say to, he barked, making me swerve slightly. Just assume you're going straight until I say otherwise. Though with your steering, straight is a pretty loose term. The two other girls in the backseat exchanged looks through the rearview mirror. When Sophia gripped the wheel too tight, he chuckled. Death grip won't help you drive better, sweetheart. This isn't a strength test. Emily stalled at a stop sign and he slapped his knee, laughing. And this is why I keep my seatbelt extra tight with you girls. Never know when We're gonna stop or if we're gonna stop. By the third lesson, we discovered his pattern. He'd make his nasty jokes for 20 minutes, then use the afternoon drives as nap time while we practiced highway driving. Don't worry about that curb you just kissed, said when I beard slightly. I'm sure it'll recover from the trauma. Unlike my neck. When Sophia asked about parallel parking, he laughed. You can barely handle forward parking and you wanna try parallel? That's adorable. He spent the entire next lesson bragging about his important dinner plans with his wife. If we survive today's lesson, that is three teenage girls driving. I should update my will. One afternoon, Sophia slightly veered and he exploded. Jesus, are you trying to collect mailboxes? Cause you're doing great. He wiped tears from laughing so hard. You know, girls like you three are why insurance rates are so high. And why driving instructors need hazard pay. It's funny because it's true. Then he made his final comparison. My five year old nephew has better control of his big wheel than you girls have of this car. He was still chuckling when he added, just try not to kill us while I. And then he was snoring, head tilted back against the headrest. I looked at Emily and Sophia in the rearview mirror and something passed between us. That's when I realised he told me to never turn unless he said so. The interstate entrance was coming up on The right, and I could see the big green sign marking I ninety five north hanging over the highway like a dare. I tilted my head slightly toward it and Emily caught my glance, following my eyes to the sign before whispering, I didn't hear him say turn, while Sophia nodded slowly and added me neither. I glanced down at the fuel gauge showing a full tank. Back at the sleeping Mister Maya, and as we approached the on ramp and I felt the car naturally wanting to continue straight onto the interstate, I took a deep breath and tightened my grip on the wheel. Well, he did say to follow his instructions exactly. The merge onto the interstate was smooth, and Mister Maya kept snoring while the highway stretched endlessly ahead. 30 minutes passed, then an hour, and his phone started buzzing in the cup holder with increasing frequency. We passed the welcome to New Jersey sign after two hours, making Emily stifle a nervous giggle as his phone lit up.

My neighbor, Mrs. Daniels, called 9 1 1 like it was her personal hotline. Monday, she reported my kids for trespassing because their ball went in her yard. Wednesday, she called the cops because my autistic son was making noise in our own backyard. Friday, she called saying the kids were in danger because they were playing tag. The 9 1 1 operator probably recognized her voice better than her own family did. Things got worse as spring turned into summer and her calls went from annoying to actually dangerous. First, she called CPS and said we left our kids alone outside. I was sitting right there on the porch with a book when the social worker showed up. They close the case right away, but people had already started talking about us. Two weeks later, during my daughter's birthday party, she called the fire department about a gas leak. Five fire trucks showed up with their sirens going and scared all 12 kids at the party. The firefighters didn't find anything, but she went on Facebook saying we were probably making drugs. The worst thing happened in July when my autistic son had a meltdown in our yard. She called 9 1 1 and said a child was being beaten. The cop showed up ready for a domestic violence call and found me hugging my upset kid. Officer Martinez said something about her false Reports but nothing happened to her. She started calling during my work zoom meetings on purpose. Other neighbors told me she kept notebooks full of made up complaints with dates and everything. She actually brag to people about making families like ours want to move away. Everything went crazy on a Tuesday in August when I got a letter from her lawyer wanting $15,000. She said we cause her emotional distress even though she was the one who called 9 1 1 53 times. I tried to talk to her like a normal person, but she said she'd add harassment to the lawsuit. That same day, my autistic son had his first friend from therapy come over to play. While the two kids were quietly playing with Legos, she called about suspicious people in my yard. Police cars surrounded my house and both seven year olds were terrified.

My boyfriend, Jake, had been the same couch potato for three years. The guy who needed me to open pickle jars was suddenly doing push UPS at 6:00am. When I asked what sparked this change, he just shrugged and said he wanted to get healthy, but something felt wrong. It started small. He bought protein powder and left it on the kitchen counter like some kind of trophy. Then he got a gym membership to this fancy place across town instead of the Planet Fitness two blocks away. When I suggested we work out together, he got weird and said he preferred going alone to focus. Red flags kept piling up. He started showering immediately after coming home from the gym, which seemed normal until I realised he never smelled like sweat. His gym clothes were always perfectly clean, too. One day I decided to surprise him with lunch at his gym. The guy at the front desk looked confused when I asked for Jake. Turns out he hadn't been there in weeks. I confronted him that night. He got defensive and said he switched gyms because the other one was too crowded. When I asked which gym, he stuttered and said some random name I'd never heard of. That's when I knew he was lying. So I did what any suspicious girlfriend would do. I followed him the next Tuesday. I Watched him drive past three different gyms and pull into the parking lot of a Starbucks. Through the window, I saw him sitting across from this blonde girl who definitely wasn't just a workout buddy. She was laughing at everything he said and touching his arm constantly. My heart was pounding as I watched them for 20 minutes. When she got up to leave, he grabbed her hand and kissed it. I wanted to storm in there and cause a scene, but instead I waited. He came home an hour later with this fake exhausted look, complaining about how intense his workout was. I played along for two more weeks watching him lie to my face every single day. He even started buying workout supplements and leaving them around the apartment as props. Worst part was when he'd flex his non existent new muscles and ask if I noticed any changes. Then I got clever. I told him my friend Emma was looking for a new gym and asked for his recommendation. He panicked and said his gym was full and not taking new members. When I offered to call and check, he quickly said they had a waiting list and it wouldn't be worth it. That weekend, Jake said he was going to a special Saturday morning workout class. Instead, I followed him to the same Starbucks. This time they were holding hands across the table and looking at something on her phone together when he leaned over and Kissed her forehead. I knew I had enough evidence, but I didn't confront him yet. I had a better plan. I went home and researched the girl on social media, found her Instagram through the Starbucks location tag. Her name was Ashley. And according to her posts, she'd been seeing someone new for the past month. The timeline matched perfectly with Jake's sudden fitness obsession. Monday night, I casually mentioned that I'd signed up for a trial at his gym and would love to work out together.

My little sister demanded I teach my study partner how to braid hair because she was convinced we were secretly in love. Emily was eight and had this weird obsession with my chemistry study partner, Conrad. Every Tuesday and Thursday when he'd come over, she'd magically appear with some urgent eight year old business. Can I show you my rock collection? Do you wanna see me do a cartwheel? Did you know I lost a tooth yesterday? Conrad was incredibly patient with her, always stopping whatever we were doing to admire her latest drawing or listen to her explain why unicorns were scientifically possible. I kept apologizing, but he just laugh and say she reminded him of his little cousins back home. He actually seemed to enjoy her interruptions, which made me like him even more. One Thursday, Emily cornered me in the kitchen while Conrad was in the bathroom. You need to teach Conrad how to braid hair, she whispered urgently. Why would I do that, M? Because when you guys get married and have daughters, he'll need to know how to do their hair for school. It's basic dad requirements. I nearly choked on my water. We're not getting married. We're just study partners. She rolled her eyes. He looks at you funny when you're working on equations. Like how dad looks at mom when she's making pancakes. Trust me, I'm very observant about Romance things. The next week, she orchestrated her master plan. Right before Conrad arrived, she accidentally left her favorite doll, Bella, in the living room, hair completely tangled. When Conrad walked in, Emily gasped dramatically, oh, no!

She returned 6 years later to find I'd divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years, Max. Don't change the locks. He left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation. To our eight year olds, that first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home, and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decisions. No more walking on eggshells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. Taught Walter to throw a curveball in our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year two brought unexpected changes. Without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I'd been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd forgotten how to enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually, she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her bonus mom. Their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes, and tucked them in at night. Year five was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and be being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year six, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward. After three years of zero Contact court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from in the living room. Through the window, we watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she owned the place. Eleanor was packing the twins lunches for

My wife Stephanie waited until we were eating dessert at Cassie and Paul's house to drop this on me. We should swap partners every Thursday, she said, and I literally watched her put her hand on Paul's thigh under the table. I saw it. Cassie saw it, too, and her face went blank. What? I asked, because I honestly thought I heard her wrong. Partner swapping. We date each other's spouses. She said it like she was talking about switching cars for the weekend. Paul kept staring at his plate and wouldn't make eye contact with me. It's already decided, Stephanie said. Thursday nights, you take Cassie out, Paul takes me. I felt my chest get tight. When did they decide this without me? This is insane, I told her. Then she leaned in close and whispered, room 2:37 last Tuesday when you were at work. My whole body went numb. She was telling me she'd already cheated and now wanted my permission to keep doing it. So are you in or not? She asked louder. I looked at Cassie, and she was crying without making any sound. Fine, I said. Let's swap partners. Stephanie smiled like she just won something. But then I noticed Cassie had stopped crying completely. Should have told me something right there. When the first date night came around, Stephanie spent forever getting ready. She put on this red Dress I've never seen before. That she'd been hiding in our closet. Paul's car was already running in our driveway when I left. I brought Cassie white roses because I remembered she mentioned liking them once. Her hands shook when she took them. Paul? Never. She started, then stopped. At dinner, she pushed her food around and barely ate anything. You okay? I asked. Paul's been different, she said quietly. For months, even before. Then she stopped talking again. I reached over and touched her hand. Before what? Nothing. Forget I said anything. But then her phone lit up with Stephanie's name, and she turned it face down immediately. When I got home that night, Stephanie was already there. Her hair was all messed up and her lipstick was smeared on the wrong side of her mouth. How was Cassie? Good. How was Paul? Then she started telling me everything they did. The hotel room, the balcony, what they did against the wall. She kept getting louder with each detail. Stop, I told her. Why? Don't you want to know? No. Her face got all twisted up. Well, I'm telling you anyway. She kept going with more details while I pulled out my phone and texted Cassie, thank you for a lovely evening. Stephanie saw my screen and threw her wine glass at the wall. It shattered everywhere, and I just stood there looking at her. The next week, I had to pick Cassie up because her car broke down. Out of nowhere. Paul was supposed to drive me, she said, looking confused. I forgot at dinner. She had way too much wine. Can I tell you something? She asked, and her eyes looked glassy. Tuesday afternoons. That's when it started. My heart started racing. What started? She covered her mouth with her hand. Nothing. Forget it. But Tuesday was when Stephanie had mentioned the hotel and we both knew what she meant. Then we had to go to Stephanie's parents house for dinner. Stephanie showed up late and I could smell Paul's Cologne all over her clothes. Her mom noticed it right away and her face changed. Is that men's Cologne? The whole table went quiet. We're sharing partners with Cassie and Paul, I said. Every week. Her dad dropped his fork and it made this loud sound. Sharing? Taking turns dating each other's spouses. Stephanie's idea. Her mom stood up from the table in my house, she said, and her voice was shaking. Stephanie tried to explain, but everyone had already smelled the Cologne and knew what was happening. That night Cassie called me. I know about Tuesday afternoons. I felt sick to my stomach about them. I followed Paul once four months ago to the hotel. She sounded drunk. I saw everything. By week five, everything fell apart. It was Cassie's birthday and I threw her a surprise party. I made a video of all her artwork and gave the speech about how talented and kind she Was. I forgot it was her birthday completely. I watched Stephanie watch Cassie cry happy tears and hold on to me like she didn't want to let go. That night, Stephanie came home from Paul's and started telling me what they did in graphic detail again. Stop. I don't want to hear it. She got mad. But I'm telling you everything. I didn't ask. Then she demanded to know what Cassie and I did together.

I found my work crush share crying in the break room, looking completely stressed. My dad's in the hospital, and I need to fly out tonight, but I can't find anyone to watch my kids. My ex won't answer, the babysitter I hired bailed, and I just. I can't afford to miss this flight, but I can't afford anything else either. She leaned against my shoulder, crying even harder. I volunteered without thinking. I'll watch them, I said, heart racing from how close she was to me. Are you serious? It's three kids. Three for at least two weeks. I waved my hand around like a lovesick fool. How hard can it be? The kids showed up at my apartment that night with tons of suitcases. The oldest, around 14, looked at her mom and said, really? Another boyfriend? Cher's face went red. He's just a friend from work, Camilla. The middle one, 10, rolled his eyes. The youngest, Kevin, wouldn't even look at me. They stood in my doorway like they were being sentenced to prison. Cher hugged them quickly, told them to be good, and left for the airport. I stood there with three kids who clearly hated me and realized I was in way over my head. The first morning, I woke up early to make them pancakes. When the oldest one, Camilla, laughed. She's not here, you know. You can stop trying, she said. Besides, You're not her type. Mom doesn't date guys without kids. We seen this a dozen times already. It hurt, but it wasn't a lie. Shares, co workers, guys from her gym, men from dating apps. Everyone wanted to play dad until they realized three kids meant actual work. And the kids really didn't make it any easier. From spilling drinks on my laptop to turning the TV up during important zoom meetings, they hated every second with me. Dude, just survive until she gets back, then ask her out. My friend told me that became the plan. Survive two weeks, do whatever to keep the kids happy. Be the hero, finally land a date with share. But like most things, it doesn't always happen the way you want it to. Sometime within the second week, the middle kid, Murph, came home from school trying to hide a black eye. Before I could even ask, Camilla grabbed ice from the freezer and held it against his face. Just pretend you didn't see anything, she told me coldly. I bent down beside them and asked in a kind but stern voice, tell me what happened. Leave me alone, he said, turning away. I shook my head. I'm not here to lecture you or get mad at you or do anything without your permission. Not even tell your mom. But I need to know what happened. Murph blinked at me and frowned. Someone called me an orphan because I don't have a dad. I patted his head and thanked him, walking away as calm as I could, even though all the blood in my body was boiling with anger. Next afternoon, I took a half day at work and showed up at their school in a rented GTR, strikingly white engine, purring like a monster. I rolled down the window and waved, wearing sunglasses and a black polo. Who's got the coolest dad now? I said loudly, as Murph and his friends ran over excitedly. Murph watched his bully's jaw drop and quickly hopped in. He rolled down the window and flipped him off, which was my signal to immediately drive off the middle school campus. Okay, I like the enthusiasm, but let's never tell your mother about this, I said, grinning. I picked up the other two kids and took them to in N out for a quick afternoon snack, then surprised them with a baseball game. Murph ate in a handful of nachos and I managed to snag a foul ball for little Celia. A bad old man, Camilla said, watching her siblings enjoy the game. We made sure to take pics with the car and at the stadium, all covered in ketchup and mustard. I sent everything to their mom with a caption we wish you were here. After that, things between me and the kids sort of changed. When the youngest, Celia, had a nightmare and called for her mom, I sat beside her bed reading out fairy tales. Until she fell asleep, I made the kids meals and lunch box

When I was 15, my mom discovered my journal where I'd written about kissing a girl from my class. She didn't knock when she barged into my room that night. Just stood in the doorway, clutching my journal with white knuckles. This ends now, she said, her voice terrifyingly calm. No daughter of mine will be this. She couldn't even say the word lesbian. I tried explaining that I was still figuring things out, that it wasn't a big deal. But mom called dad in, showed him the pages. He looked more disappointed than angry, which somehow hurt worse. They scheduled an emergency appointment with Pastor Williams the next morning. Not a therapist, not someone trained in adolescent development. Their church pastor, who believed homosexuality was a choice. Listen. For three hours, I sat in his office while he explained how I was confused, how Satan was testing me. My parents nodded along to everything he said. Mom kept squeezing my hand when I tried to speak. The following week, they announced I was being sent to my aunt for the summer. For your spiritual health, mom said. What she didn't say was that my aunt ran a church camp specifically designed to fix kids like me. Camp restoration was nothing like the name suggested. No crafts or swimming or campfires. Just daily air sessions and one on one counseling that felt more like interrogations. We Were constantly monitored. No privacy in bathrooms, no unsupervised conversations with other campers. One. One night, a girl named Tara tried to run away. They caught her at the fence and made us all watch as they prayed over her for hours, calling out the demons of rebellion and perversion. Two weeks in, I developed a fever. Not just a slight temperature. I was burning up, delirious. The camp nurse gave me some painkillers and sent me back to group sessions. When I collapsed during prayer, they finally called my parents.

He was my high school bully, Sam, who used to steal my lunch money every single day. I'm standing there with my wrinkled ticket, ready to fight this stupid 50 dollar fine when I see him squinting at me from the bench, same beady eyes, same cruel smirk starting to form. Well, well, well, if it isn't little Tommy the loser, he says into his microphone. The whole courtroom turns to stare at me. My face burns with embarrassment. Harassment 20 years later, and he's still humiliating me in front of everyone. But this time something different happens. Instead of shrinking away like I used to, I feel this wave of anger mixed with something else. I look at him sitting there in his black robe trying to intimidate me, and suddenly I see him for what he really is, a grown man who peaked in high school and never Learned how to stop being cruel. Sam, I say quietly, do you even remember why you used to pick on me? His smirk falters for just a second. That's your honor to you. No, seriously, do you remember? Because I do. I remember everything. My voice is steady now, stronger than it's ever been. I remember how you'd corner me by the lockers every morning, how you'd take my $5 and tell everyone I Was too poor to fight back. Courtroom is getting uncomfortable. People are shifting in their seats, but I can't stop. Now 20 years of silence is finally breaking. I remember going home hungry every day because of you. I remember my mom crying when she found out, thinking she'd failed as a parent because she couldn't afford to give me more lunch money. She worked two jobs, Sam, two jobs just to keep us afloat. And you made her feel like it wasn't enough. Sam's face is changing. The smugness is cracking, replaced by something that looks almost like recognition. You know what the worst part was, Sam? It wasn't the hunger. It wasn't even the humiliation. It was how you made me believe I deserved it. How you convinced a 12 year old kid that he was worthless. My hands are shaking now, but not from fear, from 20 years of buried rage finally finding its voice. I spent years in therapy because of you. Years thinking I wasn't good enough for anything. I couldn't make friends without wondering if they secretly thought I was pathetic. I couldn't date without hearing your voice calling me a loser. You didn't just steal my lunch money, Sam. You stole pieces of my childhood, my confidence, my ability to trust people. The courtroom is dead silent. Even the court reporter has stopped type. I had panic attacks in college because of you, because some part of me was still that terrified kid Hiding in the bathroom stall, praying you wouldn't find me. Do you understand what you did to another human being? Sam is staring at me now. And for the first time I see something human in his eyes, shame maybe, or recognition of the damage he caused. His mouth opens slightly like he wants to say something, but no words come out. My therapist asked me once what I'd say to you if I ever saw you again. I told her I'd probably just run. But standing here now, looking at you, I pause, wiping away a tear I didn't realize had fallen. I realize you're just as broken as you made me feel. And now here you are. I continue, still trying to make people feel small, still that same scared kid who thought making others suffer would somehow make you feel better about yourself. But it didn't work, did it, Sam? You're still miserable. I see him swallow hard for a moment. I think he might actually apologize, but then something snaps inside me. I'm not that scared kid anymore, your honor, I say, pulling out.

My brother and I used to sneak out all the time. Not for anything wild, just dumb, harmless stuff. Late night 7, 11 runs, laying on the trampoline to watch for meteors. One time we snuck out just to see if the new Taco Bell was open 24 hours. We weren't rebels, just bored kids who liked feeling like we were getting away with something. Started when I was 11 and he was 14. He'd tap three times on my wall around midnight, our signal. I tiptoe past our parents room in my socks, meet him by the laundry door and we'd sneak out like little burglars in pajamas. He always carried a backpack with snacks, flashlights and a notebook he pretended was mission logs. I think he just liked pretending we were spies. It became our tradition. Even when we weren't talking much during the day, we'd still sneak out. One time I fell asleep and missed the signal. The next morning he left a granola bar and a sticky note in my sock drawer that said, rookie Mistake, you're on thin ice, Agent B. But as we got older, things changed, got busier with school, started driving, started dating. I assumed we just outgrown it. No more nightly missions, no more late Taco Bell disappointments. I tap on the wall sometimes just to see. But he never knocked back. Then one night, about a year after our last mission, I couldn't sleep too much. Energy. I tapped on the wall knowing it was pointless, but out of habit, I crept to the laundry room anyway and the back door was already open. I stepped outside. It was cold. Damn, the kind of quiet where even your own footsteps too loud. I walked to the side gate and that's when I saw him sitting in the driveway, hoodie up, facing away from me. His backpack. The backpack was next to him. I almost called out, but something about the way he was sitting stopped me. Shoulders hunched, arms on his knees like he was holding something back. I moved closer and heard it. Quiet, shaky breathing, then a, he was crying. I crouched down beside the car, not sure if I should say anything, but then I heard him mumble something under his breath. I can't do it anymore. He wiped his face on his sleeve and pulled out his phone. I peeked around the car just enough to see the screen. It was a message thread with someone in it.

When I was 13, my sister disappeared. Not like missing, not like kidnapped, just gone out the door one night and never came back. She was 17, wild but not stupid. She fought with my mom that night. I remember that part. Something about coming home late or the way she dressed. I don't know. Mom screamed, called her names I won't repeat. And then she left. No note, no bag, just her phone and jacket. I thought she'd be back in a day or two. It wasn't. Cops came, took a report. Mom acted all worried in front of them. But as soon as they left, she lit a cigarette and said she'll come crawling back. She didn't. Weeks passed. I waited. I cried. I watched the door every night. My dad didn't say much. He just sat on the porch and drank every now and then. He'd. Mother should have handled it better. But nothing changed. No flyers, no searching, no news. And after a while, they stopped talking about her at all, like she never existed. They even maybe take her photos down, said it was too depressing, said I was being dramatic. I wasn't even allowed to say her name. So I started whispering it to myself at night like some kind of secret prayer. Nina, Nina with her chipped black nails and loud music. Nina who used to sneak me candy when I cried. I Waited for her birthday that year. I made a little card, even baked a stupid the cake. Nobody touched it. Mom rolled her eyes and dumped it in the trash. Get over it, she said. You still have a family. Did I? Because it didn't feel like it. I started saving screenshots of missing person forums of girls who looked like her. I stayed up late reading horror stories online thinking maybe one of them was her. Maybe I'd find her name in some Jane Doe report. Didn't I? Never did. By high school, I'd stopped asking questions. They made me feel crazy for even bringing her up. One time I asked mom if she ever missed her. She looked at me like I slapped her. She made her choice, she said. Don't make me regret keeping you, too. That one stayed with me. I started hiding things, money, mostly, little bits from lunch or birthday cards. I kept it in an old shoebox under my bed. I didn't know why.

The game started, and of course, I was the first to join. My username Kahoot King 2, 3, 5. Most people joined, but some didn't even bother because they knew I was unbeatable. There were 15 questions and I was dominating until I saw the leaderboard. Someone with the username you're gonna lose Sophie 8 9 was right behind me.

I fought hard for the rest of the game, but when the winners were announced, I was in second place. Second place! Meanwhile, the new champion stood there like they just won an Olympic gold medal. Turns out it was Becky. Becky! Everyone was laughing at me, so I did what any reasonable person would do. I. I let out the ha! Most powerful, earth shaking, reality bending fart of all time!

But plot twist I had to go to the doctor because apparently my butt had third degree burns.

I was 18 and technically an adult, but my parents still treated me like I was 12. My mom would go through my backpack every single day when I got home from school, checking my homework like I was in third grade. She'd read my text messages whenever she felt like it. And if I complained, she'd take my phone away for a week. My dad wasn't much better. He had this rule where I couldn't leave the house after six PM even on weekends. If I wanted to hang out with friends, I had to give them a full essay about where I was going, who would be there and when I'd be back. The final straw was when they installed one of those tracking apps on my phone without telling me. I only found out because my friend Jake mentioned seeing my location pop up when he was trying to text me. I confronted them about it that night and my mom just shrugged and said it was for my safety. My dad backed her up, saying as long as I lived under their roof, I followed their rules. Been working at this pizza place since I turned 16, saving up every paycheck except for what I needed for gas and lunch money. By the time I graduated high school, I had almost $4,000 saved up. I started looking at apartments online during my lunch breaks, telling myself I was just browsing. But the More I thought about it, the more I realized I could actually do this. Found this tiny studio apartment about 20 minutes from my job. The rent was only 600 a month and the landlord said if I could prove I had a steady income and pay first month plus deposit, he'd rent to me. I went to look at it on a day my parents thought I was at work. It was small and kind of dingy, but it was mine. I filled out the application that same day. Two weeks later, he called and said I was approved. I could move in the following weekend. That's when it hit me that I was actually doing this. I felt sick to my stomach but also kind of excited. I started slowly moving my stuff out. Every day after work, I'd grab a backpack full of clothes or books and stash them in my car. I told my parents I was staying late to help close the restaurant, which wasn't totally a lie since I was picking up extra shifts to make sure I could afford everything. The hardest part was getting my bigger stuff out. I waited until they went to my aunt's house for Sunday dinner, something I'd gotten out of by saying I had to work. I loaded up my car with my dresser, my desk and my TV, left most of the furniture since it wasn't really mine anyway, but I took the stuff that mattered. I left them a note on the kitchen counter. I kept it simple, told them I'd moved out, that I was safe and that I'd call them in a few days when I was settled. I said I needed space to figure out who I was as an adult and that I hoped they'd understand eventually. I left my house key next to the note. My phone started blowing up around 8 that night. Missed calls, texts, voice mails. My mom was crying in half of them. My dad was yelling in the others. They wanted to know where I was, if I was okay, why I didn't talk to them first. They said they'd always supported me and couldn't understand why I do this to them. I turned my phone off and didn't turn it back on until the next morning. I had 37 missed calls and way too many texts to read through. I called them back and told them I was fine, gave them my address and said they could come see my place if they wanted. My mom showed up.

She was beyond excited, posting about it on Instagram every day, telling everyone at work about it. The show was at eight PM on a Saturday. The venue was small, maybe 50 people max, and they were super strict about their no late entry policy.

And I found out in the worst way possible. My wife Michelle gained about 80 pounds after our twins were born. Honestly, I didn't care. I still found her beautiful and told her so constantly. She seemed okay with it too, always saying she'd get back in shape eventually, but never really trying. Then last year, something changed. Out of nowhere, she joined this expensive Crossfit gym and started obsessing over fitness. She'd wake up at 5:00am for workouts, meal prep every Sunday and constantly talk about her fitness journey and her new gym buddy, Adam from her accounting department. I was genuinely proud of her transformation. In six months, she looked better than she had in our wedding photos. But weird things started happening. She volunteered for every company retreat, conference and team building event, always mentioning how Adam would be there too. She bought new clothes, constantly started wearing makeup to the gym and was always texting during family dinners. The breaking point came during our daughter Leah's take your kid to work day. Leah had been excited for weeks to see Mommy's office, but when she came home, she was acting strange and quiet. How was Mommy's work, I asked while making dinner. Leah looked confused and said, why does Mommy have a different name there? My heart stopped. What do you mean, sweetheart? Everyone kept calling her Adam's girlfriend and asking when they were getting married and Mommy sat on Adam's lap during the meeting instead of her own chair. I felt sick. That evening, I casually brought up Adam, asking how their workout partnership was going. Michelle immediately got defensive, her face flushing red. We're just fitness buddies, Robert. God, you're so paranoid and insecure. Or maybe if you actually supported my health journey instead of being jealous, you'd understand. But something didn't add up. I started paying attention to details I previously ignored. She was coming home from gym sessions smelling like expensive Cologne. Her workout clothes were always pristine, no sweat stains or wrinkles. And.

My phone buzzed at 2:00am with a text that made me sit straight up in bed. Remember that favor you owe me? I need you to be my boyfriend at my sister's wedding this Saturday. Pick me up at four PM. Where? Navy. It was from Poppy, the girl who saved my entire college career three years ago. I hadn't spoken to her since graduation, when I drunkenly promised her anything, anytime after she spent an entire semester tutoring me through chemistry for free. Without her, I would have lost my scholarship and dropped out. Now she was calling in that favor. Honestly, being someone's fake boyfriend for a day seemed like a small price to pay. Plus, if I was being honest with myself, I'd always wondered what it would have been like to actually date her. When I picked her up that Saturday, Poppy answered the door looking absolutely stunning in an emerald dress that made her green eyes even brighter. But her expression was all business. She handed me a typed sheet of paper titled Our Relationship Details, with bullet points about our first date, how long we've been together, and my supposed favorite things about her. Eight months, she said, adjusting my tie without making eye contact. We've been dating eight months. You call me pop sometimes. We met at a coffee shop. Her voice was mechanical, like she was reading a grocery list. During the drive, she explained The situation? My parents keep trying to set me up with their business partner's son at every family event. He's perfectly nice, but I'm just not interested. This will shut them up for a while. The whole ride she was silent. Then when we arrived at the venue, she took a deep breath, grabbed my hand, and suddenly transformed into a completely different person. Ready, babe? She said with a bright smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. The ceremony was beautiful. I caught Poppy wiping her eyes during the vows, and without thinking, I handed her my pocket square. She looked surprised, but took it, whispering thanks so quietly I almost missed it. During the reception, I found myself forgetting this was an act. When her uncle made a toast, I instinctively put my arm around her shoulders. When the music was too loud to hear her cousin's story, I leaned down so she could whisper it in my ear, her breath warm against my neck. Her grandmother cornered us by the dessert table, pinching my cheeks and telling Poppy in a stage whisper, this one's much better than Adrian. Poppy went rigid at the name, but I squeezed her hand and smoothly changed the subject to Grandma's famous apple pie recipe. Couple's dance was when everything shifted. Poppy was stiff in my arms, counting steps under her breath like she was solving an equation. Hey, I whispered, pulling her closer, just follow me. Stop thinking so hard. She Looked up at me, and for a moment, her guard completely dropped. She melted into me, her head finding that perfect spot against my shoulder. We swayed together as the song played, and I found myself hoping it would never end. Then, during the bouquet toss, she caught it by accident when it bounced off another girl's hands. The crowd cheered, but Poppy immediately handed it to the girl beside her, laughing it off. Just superstition, anyway, she said. But I noticed her looking at the flowers longingly as the other girl walked away. Her sister pulled me aside while Poppy was in the bathroom. Thank you, she said, squeezing my arm, for making her happy, even if it's just for tonight. The words stuck with me. As the night wound down, I realized I wasn't acting anymore. When I looked at her laughing with her cousins, I felt a pull in my chest. That had nothing to do with owing her a favor, driving her home. I couldn't keep it in anymore. Poppy, I know this was just repaying a debt, but tonight felt real to me. Really real. She went completely still in the passenger seat. When I pulled up to her apartment. She practically jumped out of the car. You did great. Perfect fake boyfriend. We're even now. The words came out rushed and cold. She was already at her building's door before I could respond. I sat there for five minutes, feeling like an idiot before Driving home the next morning, Poppy's sister texted me. You left your jacket. Coffee shop on Fifth Street. When I arrived, she was sitting with Poppy's old chemistry notebook from college. He's going to kill me for this, the sister said, sliding it across the table. The margins were filled with notes about me, not chemistry notes. He remembered my coffee order, his smile when he finally understood Ionic bonds. An extra hour to help me with my own exam. Page after page of moments I completely missed. The sister explained everything. The parents never tried to set her up with anyone. Adrian was a high school boyfriend who told her she was too much when she confessed her feelings. Poppy never dated anyone after college, convinced she misread every signal. She was moving to Chicago next month for her dream job and called in the favor as a last shot to spend time with me before giving up forever. I drove straight to her apartment. She opened the door in pajamas, eyes puffy from crying before. Before she could speak, I held up a notebook. Your sister showed me this. Her face went pale. That's so embarrassing, I. I kissed her, cutting off whatever self deprecating thing she was about to say. When we pulled apart, I kept her face in my hands. I'm an idiot who needed chemistry help in more ways than one. I should have seen it three years ago. She started crying again, but this time, She was smiling. So what about Chicago? She asked. I pulled her closer. I hear it's beautiful this time of year. Plus, I still owe you the favor. Was being your boyfriend for a day, falling in love with you? That's just interest.

My sister Emma had been planning her wedding for two years and I was supposed to be her maid of honour. She kept dropping hints about how all the bridesmaids needed to look cohesive in the photos and how important it was for everyone to put their best foot forward for her big day. Look, I'm not stupid. I knew what she was getting at. I gained about 40 pounds over the past few years since I started working from home. Emma never said it directly, but every time we talked about the wedding, she'd mention some diet she saw on Instagram or ask if I was getting ready for the wedding season. The breaking point came three months before the wedding when we went dress shopping. I tried on the bridesmaid dress in my size and Emma just stared at me in the mirror with this tight smile. She asked if maybe we should size up for comfort and then suggested I might wanna start doing some pre wedding prep with her. That weekend she texted me a link to some fitness app and said, thought this might help with your confidence for the big day. I screenshot that text and sent it to my boyfriend Tyler who said she was being a total bitch. I decided I'd show her. I downloaded my fitness pal that night and started tracking everything. I cut out all the late night snacking, stopped getting coffee With extra syrup and started walking to the grocery store instead of driving. I wasn't trying to do anything extreme. I just wanted to lose enough weight that Emma couldn't make her little comments anymore. The first month, I lost 12 pounds. Emma noticed right away when we met for brunch and kept asking what I was doing differently. I told her I was just eating better. And she got this weird look on her face like she didn't expect me to actually do anything about it. By month two, I was down 25 pounds and feeling amazing. I bought new jeans that actually fit.

As a kid? When I was 12, my parents had a strict rule, no video games during the week, only weekends. But my friends would get online every night after homework and I was missing out on everything. My bedroom was directly above the living room so they could hear every footstep. The PlayStation was in my room, but the second they heard any controller clicking or game sounds, I'd be busted. That's when I discovered something brilliant, the closed captioning setting. I realized I could play games completely silent with subtitles on, no sound effects, no music, no voice acting, just pure visual gaming with text at the bottom. For two months, I played every night for about an hour after my parents thought I was asleep. I became a master of elf gaming. I wait until I heard their TV turn on downstairs, then carefully power up my PlayStation with the volume at zero. I was living my best secret life until the night my dad decided to check on me. I heard his footsteps on the stairs and had maybe 10 seconds and just turn off the PlayStation. It made noise and took too long. So I did the only thing I could. I dove into bed, pulled the covers over my head and left the game running. He opened my door and I held my breath pretending to be asleep. Through my blanket, I can see the Light from my TV screen still flickering. That's weird. I heard him mumble, he walked over to my tea. I was dead. Caught red handed, game over. But then I heard him say, honey, come look at this. My mom's footsteps came up the stairs. I was.

Ever since my son Leo was a little kid, he was just awful to other children. At 5 years old, he was kicked out of kindergarten for backing other kids into corners just to watch them cry. When our daughter Mia was born, keeping Leo away from her was a full time job. We had to move her crib into our bedroom and lock the door just to keep her secure. Later, when Mia was old enough to start losing her baby teeth, we did the whole tooth fairy thing. She put a tooth under her pillow and wake up to a few dollars. But every single morning after showing us the money, she'd tell us the tooth itself was missing. My husband and I never touched them. Around that same time, Leo claimed the old shed in our backyard as his clubhouse and told us to stay out. But I'm his mother, so one day I went in to see what he was up to. I found all of Mia's missing teeth laid out in a neat little row on his workbench. A cold feeling washed over me. When we confronted him about it, he just lost it. He screamed horrible things at us before locking himself in his room for three straight days. Over the years, we tried therapy and he was kicked out of several schools. It wasn't until high school that we saw just how risky he Was one afternoon a girl from his class knocked on our door. She looked terrified. She told me Leo had been following her home from school every day. She said she was scared for her life and didn't know who else to turn to because no one would listen. My stomach sank. I heard the real fear in her voice and I apologized over and over. I promised I would talk to him, but deep down I knew it wouldn't do any good. Nothing I said ever did. That afternoon when I mentioned the girl, he exploded. He started flipping chairs and throwing things across the kitchen. I had to run and lock myself in our bedroom to get away from him. The last thing I heard was him screaming, you'll all pay for this, before he slammed the back door and went to the shed. I stayed in my room until my husband got home. He saw the broken kitchen window and the mess from Leo's Fit and got mad. I'll go talk to him, he said. Maybe he'll listen to his father. Then he walked out to the shed. A minute later, I heard a scream that I will never forget. I ran outside and found my husband on his knees in the grass just crying. He looked up at me and whispered, don't go in there. But I had to see. I ran right past him. When I opened the shed door, I saw him.

My family still makes me weigh myself before holiday dinners. Not joking. My Aunt Rose keeps a scale by her front door specifically for me. Growing up as the fat cousin shaped everything about family gatherings. Even though I lost 140 pounds three years ago, they refuse to see it. I wear oversized hoodies to every family event now. The baggy clothes hide my body because years of their comments train me to cover up. They make me enter through the garage because they claim the front steps can't support me. My cousin Derek still calls me Big Mac and makes earthquake sound effects when I walk. Last Christmas, they gave me a group gift of weight loss surgery pamphlets and a biggest loser DVD set. Thanksgiving this year was what revealed everything. The entire extended family was there, aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents, second cousins, everyone. My grandmother had rented a huge cabin for the weekend. The torture started immediately when I walked in. Uncle Edward yelled across the room that they'd reinforced the deck chairs. Don't want another incident like the fourth of July. He laughed. There was no incident on the fourth of July. The whole room erupted in laughter. My cousin Marissa grabbed my plate at dinner before I could. I'll serve you. She announced. Portion control is important. She put three green beans and a spoonful of Turkey on my plate. Nothing else. When I reached for the Mashed potatoes. She slapped my hand. Those aren't for you. My teenage cousins started a betting pool on whether I'd sneak food later. They used a whiteboard in the living room to track their bets where everyone could see. Twenty dollars. Said I'd raid the fridge by midnight. 30 said I'd eat a whole pie. After dinner, they made me sit on the floor. The couch has a weight limit, Aunt Rose explained to her new boyfriend. We have to be careful. She said it like I wasn't even there, like I was some kind of safety hazard. I tried to tell them about my transformation. I've lost a lot of weight. I started. Derek burst out laughing so hard he spit out his drink. Sure, you have Big Mac. What did you lose? Five pounds. The room exploded. Even my mom was giggling. Honey, stop making things up, she said. It's okay to be who you are. The worst part came during family photos. They made me stand in the back corner for balance, the photographer said, after my aunt whispered something to him. Then my Uncle Edward announced I should probably skip the group jump photo. Safety first, he said, patting his stomach and winking at everyone. My cousin filmed the whole thing for her Instagram story. The caption read, Chunky's still dreaming of being skinny with crying, laughing emojis. That's when the cabin owner walked in with his son to say hi to everyone. The son stopped. Dead in his tracks staring at me. He was this athletic guy in his 30s. Looked like he lived at the gym. No way, he said. His voice cutting through the chatter. Are you Benson Clark, the gym trainer? My Aunt Rose laughed him. He can barely transform himself to the couch. The man ignored her completely. His excitement was building. This is insane, dad. This is the guy I told you about. He saved my life. The room went quiet. My Uncle Edward snorted. Chunky saved your life? What did he do? Eat all the donuts before you could get diabetes? The man's face went serious. Two years ago, I weighed 300 pounds. I found his program when I was planning to end everything. He runs one of the best transformation programs out there. I lost 100 pounds. Pulled out his phone, showing before and after photos. This man owns a chain of successful gyms. Major companies pay him massive sponsorships. He's transformed thousands of lives. My Aunt Rose's smile froze. That's, that's impossible. He works at a fast food place. The man looked confused. Fast food? He just bought the entire.

When I was eight, my cousin Tiffany came to live with us for six months while her parents sorted out their divorce. I'd always wanted a sister, and suddenly having a 12 year old girl in the house who knew about makeup and had actual opinions about music seems like winning the lottery. My mom set up the guest room for her with new curtains and cleared out half the closet. Dad built an extra shelf for her books. My little brother Sean, who was only five then, followed her everywhere until she taught him a secret handshake that made him feel special. The first weekend Tiffany was with us, she suggested we build a time capsule. We collected items all week. I contributed my favourite marble, Sean added a plastic Dinosaur, mom put in a recipe card, and dad included a baseball card. Tiffany added something wrapped in tissue paper that she wouldn't show anyone. This stays sealed until exactly 10 years from now, Tiffany said. As we buried it under the old maple tree in the backyard. We marked the spot with rocks arranged in a circle. Every Sunday became capsule checking day, where we'd go out to make sure the rocks hadn't been disturbed. Sometimes Tiffany would press her ear to the ground and claim she could hear our treasures talking to each other. Sean believed her completely. I pretended to believe, but secretly knew. Better still, I played along. In Month four, our neighbours Adrian and Yasmin, invited us to their daughter Molly's birthday party. Molly was Tiffany's age and they become friends at school. The day before the party, I overheard mom on the phone. I know it's difficult, but you need to make a decision soon, mom said. She's doing well here, but she asks about you everyday. That night, Tiffany taught me to braid my hair. Her fingers worked quickly and I sat perfectly still, afraid any movement might make her stop. When she finished, she took a picture with her disposable camera. This is how I'll remember you, she said. At Molly's party, the adults gathered in the kitchen while us kids played games in the basement. I noticed Tiffany kept checking the stairs. Molly's mom called everyone up for cake. Tiffany pulled me aside. I have to tell you something, she whispered. I'm going back home next week. The cake tasted like nothing. After that. I watched Tiffany laugh with Molly and the other older girls. She seemed happy, not like someone about to leave everything behind on her last night with us. We had pizza, Tiffany's favorite, with extra cheese. Dad made ice cream sundaes, and mom gave Tiffany a necklace with a tiny silver heart. Sean cried when he found out she was leaving and refused to do their secret handshake. It won't be special anymore if we do it when I'm leaving, Tiffany explained. After Sean went to bed, Tiffany and I Sat on the porch swing. I wanted to ask her why she had to go, why she couldn't just stay with us forever. But instead, I asked about the time capsule. What did you put in there that you wouldn't show us? A letter to you, she said. About why I really came to stay here. The next morning, her dad picked her up in a car I'd never seen before. Mom hugged him. For a long time, Tiffany hugged each of us. But when she got to me, she whispered, remember 10 years? We got two postcards from her that summer. Then Christmas cards for a few years. Then nothing. Mom said, people get busy. Dad said, that's just how life works sometimes. When I was 13, Sean wanted to dig up the time capsule early. I wouldn't let him. I promised Tiffany we'd wait the full 10 years. Last month marked exactly 10 years. I came home from college for the weekend and went straight to the maple tree. The rocks were gone. Landscapers had redone the yard years ago. I dug where I thought the capsule should be. Nothing. I tried another spot. Nothing again. I was about to give up when my shovel hit something.

My son turned eight last Saturday and his mom threw him this huge party at her parents house with bouncy castles and a magician, probably 50 people there. I showed up with my gift wrapped in newspaper because I couldn't afford wrapping paper. And my ex wife's sister actually laughed out loud when she saw it. Her husband pulled me aside and said I should be embarrassed showing my face here when everyone knows I'm three months behind on child support and asked if I even knew what grade he was in. I wanted to tell him that I actually knew his teacher personally because I've been volunteering at his school every lunch hour. But instead I just stood there and took it because arguing would just make everything worse for my boy. The whole party was basically two hours of my ex wife's family taking turns humiliating me while I tried to stay invisible near the fence. Her mom kept making these loud comments about how some fathers actually provide for their children. And her dad walked past me carrying my son's new bike and said maybe someday I could afford to buy my child something that didn't come from a thrift store. When they brought out the cake and my son wanted me to stand next to him for photos, his grandmother literally stepped in front of me and said they wanted pictures with people who were actually Part of his life. I watched my boy's face fall and it took everything in me not to say something, but I knew they'd just use it against me. Court, my ex wife's aunt asked me directly in front of everyone if I was still working that pathetic warehouse job or if I've been fired from that too. And when I said I was still there, she said at least my son would learn what not to become. My ex wife stood there telling her cousins that I lived in some disgusting studio apartment and probably spent my child support money on beer while her sister nodded along and said some people just aren't meant to be fathers and that's okay. That's when a Grace Dan pulled up and this exhausted looking woman got out carrying a thick folder and walking straight through the party toward me like everyone else was invisible. She looked distressed and said she was sorry but this couldn't wait another day because the state was threatening to pull the placement if she didn't get the inspection done immediately. My ex wife's mom immediately stepped forward and demanded to know who this woman was and what the hell she was talking about. The woman said she was from Child Protective Services and she needed to inspect my home for the foster placement renewal and verify the twins were still thriving. My ex wife's sister went completely white and whispered, what twins? The social worker flipped through Her papers and said she was talk.

Well, I tell you this, it would involve a lot less talking. Haha, I know I'm confused. Are you are you afraid? Are you afraid to tell people what what it was you wanted to do to me? Oh my God. I'm uncomfortable. I'm not afraid of anything. What is going on? Why didn't you say it? Why didn't you say what you wanted to do to me? What are you guys doing? Stop. What is happening right now? Well, you know that. Hey, hold on, Travis and Liz, what are you guys doing? Why don't you say it? If you're so if you're so bold, why don't you say it on the radio what you wanted to do? Did you want to pull my hair? What you want to do? What? What are you doing? Is this for real? Are you guys screwing with us right now? Did you set this whole second date up so you guys, I'm not screwing with you? I wanna know then what are you guys doing? How is this turning into dirty talk between you guys? Listen, he talked to me pretty dirty online before we ever even went out. I just wanna hear it out. Loud. I'm still not getting it at all. So you're not mad at him for kicking you out of the car now or you are? Yeah, I'm mad at him. I think maybe he needs to make it up to me. This is weird. I'm saying that maybe we can just channel that anger and have a really good second date. You guys, you guys are just, you guys are just fucking with me, right? You have to be. I'm not fucking with you. But Travis. Oh, God, Liz, I'm just being honest. But you're just recording this guy for. I mean, I thought we agreed on he was an ass. What happened to that? He is an ass.

But her face immediately dropped when she realized that we tricked her. My sister in law, Maya, has always been competitive with me since the day I married her brother, Jake. He couldn't handle that someone else was getting attention and what she considered her family. When Jake and I got engaged, she tried to announce her own engagement at our party. When we bought our first house, she suddenly started house hunting, too. So when we both ended up pregnant at the same time, I knew the competition was about to get intense. Maya was due just two weeks before me. And from the moment we announced, she became absolutely obsessed with finding out our baby name choice. At first it started innocently enough. She'd casually ask during family dinners, have you guys thought about names yet? When we'd de flesh, she'd push harder. Come on, just give me a hint. But then it escalated. Maya started showing up at our house unannounced, trying to peek at any baby books we had lying around. She'd walk through our nursery and comment on everything, clearly fishing for clues. She even asked my mother in law to pressure us into sharing our choice. The breaking point came when I caught her literally going through our mail when she thought we weren't looking. She was flipping through baby magazines and packages desperately searching for any Evidence of our name decision. My husband thought I was being paranoid when I told him I suspected Maya wanted to steal our name and use first. She wouldn't do that, he said, but I knew better. This was exactly the kind of petty move Maya would pull. That's when I decided to set a trap. I created a blanket, trust boards filled with names I'd never actually consider using. I strategically left a notebook open on our kitchen counter with Final Decision written in big letters next to the name Aurora Rose. When Maya came over for dinner, I even coordinated with my mom to call me while Maya was within earshot, having a completely fake conversation about how Aurora fits so perfectly with your family naming tradition and I'm so excited you finally decided. Maya took the bait. Com. Over the next few weeks, she started casually bringing up the name Aurora in random conversations, testing how we'd react. Aurora is such a beautiful name, don't you think, she'd say. Watching our faces carefully, I played along perfectly, acting slightly uncomfortable whenever she mentioned it, like she'd stumbled onto our secret. Two weeks later, Maya went into labor. Within an hour of giving birth, she posted on Facebook, welcome to the world, Baby Aurora Rose. Our little princess has finally arrived. The whole family flooded the comments with congratulations, but I noticed Maya kept checking to see if I'd responded. She was clearly waiting for my reaction to Her surprise, the next day at the hospital. Maya was practically glowing with smugness. When I walked.

My roommate Lisa was doing her nightly skincare routine when we heard glass breaking downstairs. She just applied a thick green face mask and was wearing her ratty bathrobe with hair and rollers. Did you hear that? I whispered. Lisa grabbed her phone to call 9 1 1, but then got this evil grin. Wait, I have a better idea. She crept to the top of the stairs and let out the most blood curdling scream I've ever heard, then started speaking in tongues. Literally just gibberish that sounded vaguely Latin. Spiritus Malum, enter this vessel. I heard the burglar drop something and curse. Lisa crawled down the stairs backwards like the girl from the Exorcist, still screaming in her made up demon language. The green face mask was cracking, making her look legitimately terrifying. The burglar was backing toward the window when our other roommate, Ben, emerged from his room. He immediately caught on. The possession is spreading! He yelled. Everyone get the salt! Ben started throwing table salt everywhere while chanting the Pokemon theme song in a deep, ominous voice. The burglar was now pressed against the wall. Our TV forgotten on the floor. Please, he begged. I'll leave. I'm sorry. Lisa's head snapped toward him. She put in her glow in the dark Halloween contacts. In the dim light, her eyes were literally glowing green. You disturbed the ritual, she growled. That's when our fourth roommate, Kevin, joined in. He Emerged, playing his violin badly, just screeching notes while swaying like he was in a trance. The demons need music! Ben shouted, now drawing symbols on the wall with ketchup. Play louder! The burglar tried to run, but Lisa's spider walked toward him at surprising speed. He actually screamed. I need an old priest and a young priest, I yelled, getting into it. I'm Protestant! The burglar cried. I don't know any priests! Lisa stood up suddenly, did a perfect backbend and whispered, then you're screwed! The man literally wet himself. I saw the stain spreading on his jeans. Kevin's violence screeching intensified. Ben was now speaking in Klingon. Lisa started doing that creepy clicking sound from the grudge. The burglar fell to his knees. What do you want from me? Your soul, Lisa hissed. Or your confession? I'll confess. I've robbed 12 houses. I'll tell you everything! He started listing addresses, eightes where he'd sold stuff. Ben was frantically taking notes while still pretending to be possessed. When the cops arrived, they found a burglar in tears, begging for an exorcist. Lisa, still in full green face mask and glowing contacts. Catch up! Demon symbols on our walls. Kevin playing my heart will go on badly on violin, Ben reading the burglar his rights in Klingon. The burglar immediately confessed to everything. Begged the cops to take him to a church instead of jail. Kept asking if we were really human. The officer looked at Lisa. Ma'am, what exactly Happened here. Skincare night, she said sweetly. Very important for your pores. They took the burglar away. I was muttering about the green demon and violent of the damned. Cops came back later for our statements. One of them finally cracked. In 20 years on the force, I've never had a purse bag for holy water in the squad car. Turns out the burglar had been hitting houses in our area for months. His full confession cleared over a dozen cases. The detective said whatever you did probably saved him from years more crime. He found religion real quick. Already signed up for seminary school. Lisa's review of her fake

At 5 7 and 140 pounds, I wasn't exactly the most intimidating drunk. Guys at bars always picked me when they wanted to look tough in front of women. So when I saw this 6 2 gym bro marching over to where I was chatting with a pretty brunette, I already knew how this would go. He wedged himself between us, his massive frame completely blocking me out. Didn't even look at me, just turned his broad back like I was furniture. Let me get you a real drink, beautiful, he said. Flag down the bartender, not whatever this little guy was boring you with. She glanced around his shoulder at me, clearly uncomfortable. Actually, we were just, trust me. He cut her off, placing a protective hand on the bar in front of her, creating a wall. You need someone who can actually take care of you. He ordered her a martini without asking, then finally acknowledged my existence with a dismissive glance. You can go now, buddy. When I didn't move, he shifted his weight, using his size to push me further down the bar. The edge of the counter dug into my ribs. Still, I stayed put, sipping my beer. He'd expected me to scurry away by now. He turned to me fully for the first time, looking me up and down with theatrical disgust, asked If I, I was deaf or something. When I calmly said I was just finishing my drink, his hand shot out and swiped my glasses off my face. They clattered across the bar. Everything went blurry. He made jokes about me not being able to see up to his height, told the girl maybe that's why I hadn't gotten the hint. I stayed still, breathing normally. 10 years of training had taught me the most important lesson, real fighters don't fight in bars. Too much liability, too much to lose my instructor certification, my gym, potential lawsuits, all gone over some drunk idiot. I reached for my glasses with measured movements, slid them further away with one finger, told me to leave them. I walked around him to retrieve them, keeping everything neutral. When I sat back down with my glasses, he spun around to face the entire bar and announced loudly that we had a creeper situation. His voice boomed over the music as he pointed at me with his beer bottle, claiming I've been bothering this nice lady for an hour. The brunette tried to protest, but he interrupted, putting a possessive hand on her shoulder that made her flinch, told everyone not to worry, he had it handled. His buddies at a corner table started laughing and shouting. Someone asked if I was in middle school, grinned and turned to the bartender, suggesting I should be carded again because I looked about 12. The brunette pulled away. From his hand, but he kept talking over her, telling her she didn't have to be polite anymore. Half the bar was watching now. Some people whispering, shooting me suspicious looks. My reputation at this place where I've been a regular for two years was being destroyed in real time. Then he decided to demonstrate my weakness. He grabbed my wrist, suddenly holding it up for the bar to see while comparing it to his 12 year old nephew's arms. I didn't resist, keeping my breathing steady as he squeezed harder, his thumb pressing into the pressure point. He yanked me off the bar stool, effortlessly spinning me around to show the girl what would happen if real danger showed up. Then shoved me back against the bar. Not hard enough to be considered assault, but enough to make his point. The edge dug into my spine. He stood there waiting, telling me to push back, show her I was a real man. I stayed relaxed, hands at my sides, no aggressive stance, nothing that could justify what he wanted to do. His face darkened at my non reaction, called me pathetic. He turned to the girl, explaining this was why she needed someone like him around, painted scenarios of what could happen with me just standing there doing nothing if he was actually dangerous. The brunette stood up, said she was leaving. He grabbed her wrist immediately insisting he'd walk her to her car because the streets weren't safe. Her voice was firm, but I could hear the fear underneath. When she told him to let go, he tightened his grip slightly, still smiling, saying he was just trying to help. She tried to pull away, but he held firm, told her to relax. He was just being a gentleman. His grip tightened enough to make her gasp. She was getting genuinely scared now. Panic in her voice as she pushed against his chest with her free hand. That's when something shifted in his eyes. The drunk bravado turned into something ugly.

So I've been feeling like the backup friend for months. It started when I got really sick with the flu last winter. I'm talking fever, can't get out of bed sick. I texted our group chat asking if someone could bring me soup or medicine from the store. Radio silence for 3 hours. Then finally, Emma responds with, Oof, feel better. And that's it. But two days later, when Brad wanted people to come help him move his couch, four of them showed up immediately. I started paying attention after that. When I'd suggest hanging out, I'd get excuses. When anyone else suggested something, suddenly everyone was free. During conversations, they talk over me or just ignore what I said completely. At restaurants, they'd split the Bill evenly, even though I always ordered the cheapest thing because I was broke from college. The final straw was my birthday last month. I planned this whole thing at Dave and Buster's and invites two weeks early. The day of, I'm sitting there alone at a table for seven. One by one, the cancellations rolled in. Emma had a family thing. Tyler forgot he had to work, just said her car wouldn't start. But here's the kicker. I saw Tyler's Instagram story later that night. He was at some house party with people from our group, including Jess, whose car had mysteriously started working. That's when I decided to test them. I crafted this message about how my mom was in the hospital after a car accident and I was scared and needed someone to drive me there because I was too shaken up to drive. I sent it to our group chat at seven PM on a Thursday. First response came from Emma an hour later. Oh, no, hope she's okay. Keep us updated. No offer to help. Tyler hearted the message. That's it. Just hearted it like it was a funny meme or something. Just texted me privately saying she would help but her boyfriend had the car. Brad said he was at work until late. Two others never even responded. Six people I'd called my best friends for four years and when I needed them most, they all had excuses. But here's where it gets interesting. I have this coworker named Alex who I'd only hung out with a few times outside work. He barely knew me beyond small talk about weekend plans. I decided to text him the same message just to see what would happen. This guy dropped everything, called me immediately, said he was leaving his girlfriend's apartment right then to pick me up, showed up at my door 20 minutes later with snacks and a phone charger, asking which hospital and if I needed anything else. I felt so bad I almost came clean right there. Instead, I told him my mom was okay, that it was just a Scare and false alarm. He was genuinely relieved and said he was glad to help anytime. Meanwhile, my so called best friends were still posting TikToks and Snapchat stories like nothing happened. The next day in our group chat, everyone asked how my mom was doing. I said she was fine. Thanks for all the support. The sarcasm went right over their heads. Emma even had the nerve to say that's what friends are for with a heart emoji. I started pulling back after that, stopped initiating conversations, stop suggesting plans. Guess what happened? Nothing. They literally didn't notice I was gone. Three weeks passed before anyone texted me directly and it was only because Tyler needed someone to cover his shift at the pizza place where we both worked. Last weekend was the breaking point. I saw on Instagram they all went to this escape room place we talked about going to for months, the same place I'd suggested multiple times and got shut down. There they were, all six of them posting stories with captions like squad goals and best friends forever. So I made my decision. I started a new group chat called Real Friends Update with just Alex and two other people who'd actually shown they cared. I posted about moving on from fake friendships and finding people who actually value you.

Y'all were always talking, laughing at dumb stuff, venting, being weird together, making the most unhinged inside jokes that nobody else would get. And now they're just gone.

Especially when I see you online, in games, in calls with your new little friend group. Like, bro, I'm not stupid. I see the green dot. I see the whole friend list active. Don't lie to me and say it's nothing. You just stopped choosing me. And what hurts more is feeling like I'm just a backup now. Like I'm being kept around just in case the new group drops you or switches up. Like I'm the in case of emergency friend. I'm not a fostering safety net. You used to need me. Now I'm just convenient when you're bored. And I see it, I feel it, and it sucks. But you know what? I'm done begging for space in your life. I'm done waiting for a text back just to see you on Facetime with the new crew. I'm done being loyal to someone who already left me without saying a word. So, yeah, it hurts. It hurts like hell. But I'm not gonna sit here and cry over someone who doesn't miss me. I'm Gonna wipe my tears, put on lip gloss or chapstick, whatever. And remind myself I'm not the problem you fumbled. I was a real one. And when that new group starts acting funny, when you remember what it felt like to have someone who actually cared, just know this friendship doesn't do returns.

I had stomach problems my whole childhood. Every single time I felt sick, my mom would roll her eyes and say, you're not dying. Go lie down. My dad would just laugh and tell me, she's just trying to get out of chores again. It didn't matter if I was doubled over in pain or throwing up, they always had the same response. Stop being dramatic. Take some medicine. You're fine. By the time I was 14, I had Learned to just suffer in silence. There was no point in telling them anything because they never believed me anyway. One night in October, I woke up around midnight with the worst pain I'd ever felt in my life. It was like someone was stabbing me in the stomach with a hot knife. I was sweating so bad, my sheets were soaked and I could barely stand up without shaking. I stumbled to their bedroom door and knocked softly. Mom, dad, I think something's really wrong. My mom opened the door, looking annoyed. She took one look at me standing there in my pajamas, sweating and shaking, and sighed, Layla, it's the middle of the night. Stop being so dramatic and take some Pepto. We have work tomorrow. But, mom, this feels different. It really hurts and I think I might need to go to the hospital. My dad's voice came from the bed. She's just trying to get attention. Tell Her to go back to bed. My mom nodded and started closing the door. You heard your father. Go lie down and stop waking us up over nothing. I went back to my room and tried to sleep, but the pain kept getting worse. By two in the morning, I was throwing up bile and could barely think straight. I tried walking to the bathroom, but halfway down the hallway, everything went black. My little brother Kevin found me collapsed on the floor at four in the morning. He was only eight, but he started screaming for our parents when he saw me lying there unconscious. My dad came running out, cursing under his breath, what the hell is wrong with her now?

I spent 15 years building the internet infrastructure for our small town in Nebraska. Everyone knew me as the internet guy. When your Wi-Fi went down at 2:00am, you called me. When you wanted faster speeds for your home office, I was your guy. What most people didn't know was that I didn't work for some big company. I, I owned every cable, every tower and every router box in town. I was the provider. Everything started falling apart when Jerry Davidson got elected to City Council. This guy had been gunning for me ever since I refused to give him free internet for his campaign office two years earlier. At the first town meeting, Jerry stood up with this big presentation about bringing in competition. We need options, said, pointing at charts showing how much cheaper national providers were. Alex has had a monopoly too long. The new company, Net Connect, rolled into town with promises nobody could refuse, half the price, double the speeds and a name people recognized from TV commercials. They set up a booth at the farmers market offering gift cards just for signing up. Within three months, I watched my customer base get cut in half. By six months, I had maybe 30 customers left out of 800. People stopped waving when they saw me around town. Mrs. Henderson, who used to bring me cookies every Christmas, wouldn't even make eye contact at the grocery store, at Pete's Diner, conversations would stop when I walked in. Some people actually laughed when Jerry made jokes about my outdated service during council meetings. Tried everything. Lowered my prices below cost, offered free installation, threw in premium channels. Nothing worked. Net connected poisoned the well. My savings account hit zero. My girlfriend Katie left me for some guy who worked at the bank. My business was circling the drain and I was three months behind on my truck payment. That's when I started reading contracts real carefully. See, Net Connect had signed a deal with the city to run their fiber cables through existing infrastructure. They were using my utility poles, my access boxes, and most importantly, my signal towers. The contract gave them access, but only if I granted maintenance permissions. Harry had been so excited to stick it to me that he never bothered reading the fine print. When the city originally gave me exclusive rights to install towers 15 years ago, I wrote a clause that let me shut down signal access with 60 days notice. Back then, it seemed like a smart way to protect my investment. Now it was my nuclear option. I spent three nights going through every page of every contract. It connects infrastructure piggyback completely on my original network backbone. They never laid fresh lines because it would have cost millions. They just plugged into what I'd already built and called it an upgrade. On a Tuesday morning, I walked into City Hall and filed my 60 day notice to terminate signal access. Jerry was there picking up some paperwork and saw me at the counter. He asked what I was doing with a smug grin on his face. Just some routine maintenance paperwork, I told him. Netconnect's lawyers showed up exactly one week later.

My 11 year old daughter started acting like a grown woman and I thought it was just early puberty stuff, but then I realized something much darker was happening. My daughter was one of those girls who hit puberty like a freight train. One month she was my little girl in Pokemon t shirts. The next month I was desperately searching the junior section because nothing in kids sizes would button across her chest. I started noticing the attention before I could pretend it wasn't happening. We were at target when she said casual as anything, that the man in electronics had followed us to three different aisles. She didn't sound scared, just stated it like a fact, like she was telling me it might rain. It got bad when she started consuming content that no 11 year old should even know existed. Her iPad history at 2:00am showed romance novels about CEOs and secretaries, bookmark folders labeled Dark Romance and Age Gap. She discovered Wattpad and archive of our own reading explicit stories about innocent girls and men who know better. Her YouTube algorithm had shifted completely. Makeup tutorials for that clean girl aesthetic. How to look expensive, feminine energy that drives men crazy. She was watching videos about how to walk in heels, how to make your voice sound more sultry, how to flirt without being obvious. When I tried to stop her from consuming that Content. She turned into someone I didn't recognize. He started using therapy speak to manipulate every conversation. I was gaslighting her when I set boundaries, being toxic when I said no to crop tops. Emotionally abusive for taking her phone at night. She'd Learned these words somewhere and weaponized them perfectly. Her friend group shifted overnight. The girls her age were suddenly so immature and childish. She gravitated toward eighth graders, then high schoolers, who'd wave at her during pickup. Started lying with disturbing ease. He was at the library, but really at Starbucks with older kids. At Emma's house, but actually at the mall. She figured out how to delete specific texts while keeping others clear. Only certain parts of her history created fake contact names. Emma mom was really someone named Tyler. She started sitting differently, legs crossed like an adult. Hand gestures while talking that she'd copied from somewhere. At family dinners, she'd insert her self into adult conversations about work, drama, and relationships, offering advice like she was 30. When we visited relatives, she spent the entire time with the adults, laughing at jokes she shouldn't understand, making comments about wine and coffee preferences. She didn't have. The secrets multiplied like cancer. Her phone became Fort Knox. Password changed weekly, face ID disabled so I couldn't use it. While she slept, she'd angle the screen away reflexively. Muscle memory from constant deception. I found out from another mom that my daughter had been telling everyone she was 16, not 11. With a whole fabricated backstory about being held back. Started lying about everything. Library visit. It's that were really mall trips with high schoolers, study groups that didn't exist. Sleepovers at houses I never heard of. Her bedroom door stayed locked constantly. Music blasting to cover phone conversation. She stopped talking to me entirely. Dinner became silent warfare. One word answers while scrolling under the table. Her former best friend's mom called concerned. Apparently, my daughter had told the girl she'd outgrown their friendship. At her spring concert, she wore the required black dress, but she'd altered it somehow. Taken in the waist, shortened the hem. She looked like a teenager, not an eleven year old. As she walked across the stage, I watched father's heads turn and follow her movement. These weren't strangers. They were soccer dads, TA volunteers. My neighbor. Their gazes lingered a bit too long before they caught themselves. But what disturbed me most was her awareness of it. She wasn't innocent to the attention anymore. She expected it and seemed to feed off it. After the performance, she didn't run to me like the other kids ran to their parents. She stood with the older performers, laughing at something on someone's phone. When I finally got her attention, she rolled her eyes and mouth. Five more minutes. Like I was embarrassing her. That night, I waited until she would.

He was too scared to call you guys. Oh, okay. Well, that's fine. What's your brother's name? It's Todd. Okay, so what are we doing for you? So Todd has a girlfriend named Renee. She got pregnant, and she told Todd that he's the father. But I think she's lying, and Todd thinks she's lying. Pretty much my whole family thinks she's lying. Oh, okay. So do you think she messed around on your brother, got pregnant, and then told him, surprise, honey, we're pregnant? Yep, that's exactly what I think happened. Okay. Have you told your brother you think that's what happened? Oh, yeah, of course. Actually, I never really liked this girl to begin with, and then when she got pregnant, Todd was the one that came to me and told me that he wasn't sure how it happened. Oh, okay. I mean, well, I can tell you how it happened, but I don't think any of us need those details, so. So your own brother said, I don't think it's mine? Well, I'm his big sister, so I kind of came down on him after she got pregnant, and I was like, how could you be so irresponsible? Yeah, okay. And he was just like, I was responsible every time. Well, maybe he was just saying that so, like, you would get off his back a little. No, he straight up told me. I'm scared to say anything, but I Don't think I'm the one who did it. Oh, okay, well, why is he scared to say anything? Yeah, he's got a right to defend himself, too. That's what I told him. I was like, go and get a blood test done. And he was like, do you know how bad that's gonna look if it turns out I am the father? And I have to say, oops, sorry I accused you of sleeping around on me. It's gonna look like I don't trust her. Yeah, I guess. Yeah, but. But, you know, Jeez, the guy has the right to know the truth. So at this point, he's still with her? Yep. He's just acting like it's his baby and he's gonna stay with her all the way through everything. He's paying all this money for baby stuff, and they're even looking for a place to live together. Okay, meanwhile, you're upset for him cause you don't think it's his. No, I mean, I don't trust her. I never have. I'm sorry. I know that's a terrible thing to say about your brother's girlfriend, but it's true. No, it's. It. Look, I, I had two sisters. They hated almost every girl I ever brought home. I mean, I, I, I told girls that I did. If my sisters like you, then you pretty much passed the test. So you would like to know once and for all, for sure if your brother is really the father of this kid? Yeah. Okay, uh, couple of questions before we move forward this, because this is kind of important. Does your brother know you're doing this? And is he okay with it? Yes, he knows, and he's okay, but he just doesn't want to be involved in it. Okay. And how far along in the pregnancy is this girl? What. What's the girl's name again? Renee. Renee. How far along is Renee? She's about five months. Okay. Now, do you happen to know the name of the doctor she's been seeing for her baby? Doctor appointments or anything? I don't, but I'm sure my brother does. He goes to all the appointments with her. Okay, see if you can get the doctor's last name first, cause that's gonna help us out a ton. Okay. And then also, we're gonna need her phone number, too. Of course. Okay, I'm gonna text my brother right now. Okay, cool. I'm gonna put you on hold the shag while you do that. We're gonna hit a break. When we come back, we'll see if we can figure out the truth about what's really going on. Uh, now, this is the DOC. Do we have the doctor's name? That we don't. We don't have the name. We have the office. We have the office number. That'll work. Okay. Okay, so this is. We're gonna call Renee. Renee is the girlfriend. We're gonna call her and we're going to pretend that we are from the office that she has. Been visiting for her? Yep. Updates or checkups and stuff like that.

Now, according to my mom, I've ruined his wedding. I, 28 m, have a twin brother. Growing up, we were inseparable and until recently, I thought we were still very close. I was always more of a shy nerd and he was an extrovert that played sports throughout our childhood in high school. But we spent almost all of our time together by choice. We went our separate ways. When college came, he stayed local in Arizona and I went to college in Portland. When I graduated, I stayed there because I fell in love with the city. My friends are here. My professional networks from internships were here, etcetera. But I always flew back home for holidays, events, birthdays, etcetera. My brother announced on Instagram that he and his girlfriend of 3 years got engaged. I was incredibly happy for him and texted him congrats. He mentioned they were planning to have an engagement party in 6 to 8 weeks and I told him to let me know so I can book a flight to come celebrate. I was never told a date. If I brought it up with him or anyone in my family, they'd change the subject or say it's still being planned and confirmed. After a few weeks, I texted my brother to ask about The date because it must be getting close and I don't want to pay for a last minute flight. No response. I asked my mom for details and she said it's not really an engagement party, just a small dinner with family. There's no need to come down for it. I eventually found out that it was in fact a big party. They rented out an entire restaurant for four hours and there were about 80 guests, family, friends, cousins, everyone. Everyone was told I couldn't make it. My aunt, who was like a second mother to me, texted me that she was very disappointed I couldn't make time to join. And I replied that I would have happily come, but I was not invited. Word spread quickly about my snub and my parents and brother tried to say it was just a misunderstanding. That was almost over a year ago. Since then, I've tried to get to the bottom of why I wasn't invited over the course of months. It went from it was just meant to be a small gathering to I don't know what happened, there must have been a miscommunication, to it's just a party, it's no big deal. I asked my brother if he was mad at me. I thought maybe his fiance didn't like me, even if she or he didn't want me there. Why were my parents okay with this? This really wasn't like them. Christmas and Easter was awkward because no one But me wanted to address the elephant in the room, and any conversation about anything was like small talk with strangers. When I visited in may for my sister's birthday, I left early after my sister said, you moved so far away, it's like you're not really family anymore. You make everything feel so weird. Now, nine months ago, I got the save a date announcement.

After mom died from cancer, dad sat by her hospital bed for 16 hours holding her hand. He kept saying, I can't do this without you, Sarah. Please don't leave me. The nurses had to give him something to calm down just so he'd let go. When we got home, dad walked around like he wasn't really there. For weeks, he left all Mom's stuff exactly where it was. Her coffee mug sat on the counter with her lipstick Mark. That made me cry. Every morning he asked me, Emma, could you make her chicken Parmesan tonight? It would help me feel like she's still here. While I cooked, dad watched old home videos on repeat in the living room. At first, it was nice hearing Mom's laugh all the time and pretending like she was still with us. But as winter turned to spring, Dad's sadness shifted into something scary. He stopped sleeping in their bedroom and moved to the couch, telling me, I can't sleep in there, Emma. It smells like her perfume and I hear her breathing. At 3 in the morning, I'd find him hugging her pillow, talking to nobody. I suggested therapy and he actually agreed to go twice a week. But it wasn't long before I found appointment cards in the trash. One April night when I came out of the bathroom, he called me Sarah in the dark hallway. He immediately followed up with, sorry, Emma, you Just you looked like her for a second. His apology was anything but reassuring because something in his eyes had changed. I reminded him, dad, I'm Emma, your daughter. And he nodded slowly without saying anything. I thought it would end there, but he called me Mom's name more and more. I tried to tell myself it was just part of the process. That's when he started buying me the same clothes mom wore. These ugly flower shirts kept showing up in my closet and he'd lie they were on sale and I thought you'd look nice in them. When I told them that they were Mom's style, he'd just say exactly with this sickening smile. My shampoo kept getting replaced with Mom's brand and when I switched it back, it would mysteriously change again within days. Then one morning, all my stuff had been moved to their bedroom. When I asked why, through tears, he said, I need you close, Sarah. Emma, I mean, Emma, the nightmares are getting worse. That was the last time he called me Emma. I could tell something terrible was coming, but nothing could have prepared me for their anniversary morning. I woke up to him on my bed with a breakfast tray, roses everywhere, candles burning and their wedding song playing. He smiled and said, happy anniversary, my love. I can't believe it's been 20 beautiful years of marriage. I sat up fast and said, dad, what the f is this? Suddenly I Was hit with a wave of dizziness. When I tried to catch my balance, he smiled. You've been so tense recently, Sarah, so I put anxiety medication in your water. I sat there helpless as he pulled out red undergarments. He held it up saying, you wore this on our wedding night. Time to put it on again. I shook my head hard and said, dad, please, you're scaring me. I'm Emma. But his eyes looked empty. When I pushed the tray away, he grabbed my wrist hard. Why are you acting like this, Sarah? He said, while I screamed, mom is dead. I'm Emma. I'm your effing daughter. His twisted and he yelled, stop lying. You're my wife. You've always been my wife. He lunged forward, trying to kiss me, hands, grabbing at my chest while saying, this is our anniversary. Stop pretending you don't remember our first time. I screamed, get off me, and bit his lip until it bled. As I stumbled to the bathroom, he called, Sarah, come back. Don't lock me out on our special day. I barely locked the door before he got there. He pounded on it saying, I'll be gentle, I promise, just like our first time. Please don't be scared, my love. When I didn't respond, his tone shifted to anger. Sarah, open this door right now. A wife doesn't lock out her husband. All I wanted to do was call for help, but I didn't have my phone on me. When I heard him punching through the door, I screamed, help, somebody help me. Thankfully, somehow my neighbor, Mister Lee, heard dad was able to unlock the door after he punched through it. And he had this sick smile. My skin crawled when he said, there you are, sweetheart. No more hiding, catching me with a needle. This will help you remember who you are. I fought back as hard as I could, though I knew he could overpower me. But everything stopped when Mr Lee pounded on our front door. John, is everything okay in there? He yelled. Dad called out, everything's fine, Tom. Sarah is just having one of her episodes again. But Mr Lee yelled back.

In high school, my friend Arthur started this game called Awkward Questions. The rules were simple. You had to ask your teacher the most uncomfortable but technically appropriate question. Question. Possible points based on how flustered they got it started innocent. Missus Williams, do you think Romeo was taking advantage of Juliet? Five points for her nervous laugh. Mister Davis, why do we study the Great Depression when we're living through 1? 10 points for his visible confusion. But Arthur was competitive. He kept pushing boundaries, hunting for that perfect question that would break a teacher completely. His target was Mister Wayne, our AP chemistry teacher. Guy was unshakable. Thirty years of experience, seen every teenage trick in the book. Arthur spent weeks researching, looking for the perfect chemistry related question that would crack him. Then he found it. I found out later that Arthur had been digging through old local newspaper archives for weeks. He found a 10 year old obituary for Bruce Wayne, age 16. Died from accidental chemical poisoning. Arthur connected the dots. Same last name as our teacher, same small town. He found Mister Wayne's deceased brother. During class, Arthur raised his hand with that evil grin we all knew meant trouble. Mister Wayne, I was reading about chemical compounds last night. Is it true that when you mix household bleach with ammonia creates chlorine gas? Mister Wayne froze. Why would you ask that, Arthur? Arthur leaned back. In his chair, savoring the moment. Just curious about the chemical reaction. You know, for educational purposes. The teacher's face went white. Arthur, I need you to stay after class. We thought Arthur had finally won the game. Mister Wayne looked genuinely shaken. After class, Arthur was practically bouncing with excite. This was his masterpiece. Mister Wayne locked the door and sat down heavily. Arthur, where did you learn about that specific reaction? Just some research I found online, Arthur said, barely containing his smirk. That's when Mister Wayne broke down crying. And Arthur started smiling. You know about Bruce, don't you? Arthur smile faded. He hadn't expected this reaction. Mister Wayne's younger brother had passed away from exactly that chemical mixture. The family tragedy destroyed his parents marriage and sent his mom into severe depression. Mister Wayne became a chemistry teacher specifically to educate kids about chemical safety so no other family would go through what his did. Arthur had deliberately weaponized the teacher's worst trauma for points in a game. He reported Arthur to the principal for psychological harassment and requested a transfer to another school district. Within a week, the story spread. Parents heard about a student psychologically torturing a teacher, about his deceased brother. Words spread fast. Parents found out a student had deliberately targeted a teacher's family tragedy for a game. Arthur got expelled, not suspended, expelled. His college applications were destroyed. Every university rescinded their offers when they Learned what he'd done. Mr. Wayne Had a complete mental breakdown next day. 28 years of teaching and Arthur's calculated cruelty shattered everything he built to cope with his deceased brother. He started having panic attacks in class. Couldn't sleep. Kept seeing his dead brother's face in every student. The school had to call paramedics twice when he collapsed. His wife found him three weeks later, talking to his brother's photo, planning a chemistry lesson for him. He was admitted to a psychiatric facility. He's still there. Arthur's parents sent him to military school in another state. His dad was so ashamed, he wouldn't even drive him there. The worst part. Arthur's younger sister goes to our school now. She gets bullied constantly because everyone knows what her brother did. Kids call her psycho Arthur's sister and avoid sitting near her. She had to switch lunch periods because someone put a fake obituary in her locker with her name on it, saying she passed away from accidental chemical poisoning by her brother. All because Arthur thought targeting a teacher's dead brother would be hilarious. The game ended that day. None of us could stomach it anymore. Arthur had won, but he destroyed everything in the process.

My boss, Rachel, is basically the coolest person at our advertising agency. Last month, she sent out the group text about her party on Friday night. Everyone was hyped, talking about it during lunch breaks, planning what to wear, the whole thing. But I never got the text. I figured maybe she just forgot to add me or maybe my phone was being weird. Thursday rolls around and I'm hearing more party talk. People are discussing who's bringing what drinks and someone mentioned the karaoke machine. Starting to feel pretty left out, but I don't wanna seem desperate by asking about it. Friday afternoon comes and everyone's buzzing about getting ready after work. That's when I finally worked up the courage to walk into Rachel's office. I knocked on her door and she looked up with this bright smile. Hey, what's up? She said, I took a deep breath. So, um, I think there might have been a mix up. I didn't get the text about tonight's party. Her face immediately changed like all the color just drained out of it. She stared at me for what felt like forever before clearing her throat. Oh, right about that, she started fidgeting with her pen. The thing is, this party is more of a core team event. Core team. I've been there for two years. I worked overtime constantly and never complained. I brought donuts every Friday and covered for People when they were sick. What do you mean core team? I asked. She couldn't even look at me. Well, you know, people who are more central to the office dynamic. That hit me like a punch to the gut. I just nodded and walked out. The whole office cleared out at 5 sharp and I sat there alone pretending to work while everyone else headed to have fun without me. But here's where it gets interesting. Around 9 that night, I get a call from my friend Jamie who works in accounting. She's whispering and sounds panicked. Dude, you need to check Rachel's Instagram Story like right now. I open Instagram and there's Rachel's story from the party. Everyone's having a blast, dancing, playing beer pong. But in the background of one video, I see something that makes my blood boil. There's a whiteboard with party planning written at the top. And underneath it says who not to invite with my name right at the top of the list. But that's not even the worst part. Next to my name, someone had written too weird and kills the vibe. Other people had similar mean comments next to their names. Basically, anyone who wasn't part of Rachel's little inner circle got roasted on this board. I screenshot everything before she could delete it. Then I spent the weekend thinking about what to do. Monday morning, I walk straight to HR with the screenshots. Turns out excluding employees from company sponsored Social events based on personal preferences is a huge liability issue, especially when there's written evidence of the reasoning being discriminatory. HR launched an investigation immediately. Within a week, three people had come forward saying they felt excluded and harassed by Rachel's click behavior. Apparently this has been going on for months and I was just the first person brave enough to speak up. Rachel got fired two weeks later, not just for the party thing, but they discovered she'd been playing favourites with assignments, giving her friends easier projects and better reviews. The new boss they brought in, she's way more professional and actually treats everyone equally. We still have office parties, but now everyone gets invited properly and no one keeps mean lists. Best part is Rachel tried to get unemployment but got denied because she was terminated for misconduct. I heard through the Grapevine that she's working at a call centre now.

I used to work as a prison guard and one day our warden decided it would be a good idea to bring his 10 year old daughter in so she could see where dad works. He left her alone in his office for just a minute. When she wanted out, he found her 10 minutes later in one of the corridors bleeding out from her head with a fly on her pants undone. Watching him clutch her against his chest and hold her lifeless body repeating daddy's got you, sweetheart for hours was a sight I'll never forget. From that moment on, he became obsessed with finding out who did this. He didn't even take a day off from work, just came in next morning off, no sleep, spent the whole day grilling every prisoner in guard. He offered bribes, reduced sentences, special privileges, anything for information. I remember watching him break down between interviews then slam his head into the wall repeatedly just so the physical pain could momentarily drown out the emotional one for long enough to conduct the next interview. He grounded everybody he thought gave suspicious answers and threatened them with solitary confinement, beatings, firings for guards. He even went as far as forcing a prisoner to wear a wire during yard to hopefully catch an admission, threatening that prisoner with an extra two years to his sentence if he didn't wear it. Unfortunately, his interviews didn't get him an answer. So He started becoming more harsh. Two and a half weeks after the death, he came into work hammered and grabbed me by the shoulders, telling me today was the beginning of the end. He then rounded up all the prisoners and announced to them that until the truth about who did it comes out, they would only be getting fed every second day. The backlash was brutal and the warden took that as a sign that the people protesting were guilty. Got a hold of everyone who stepped out of line and ordered us, the guards, to beat them. Some guards, including myself, felt bad and didn't want to. But he threatened our jobs, saying if we're hesitating, then that means one of us must have called his daughter. He'd pace her.

What? Oh, my God. No way. What? No, Roger, if you think it's a joke, I'll put the car in your name. Oh, my God. Do not take, you can't take that. That's not a way to start a healthy relationship. Well, what's a good way to start a healthy relationship? Get drunk and hook up in the back of a car. There's other options. Listen, I'll show up to the date in your new car with a ribbon and bow around it. And if you don't like me, I'll have my sofa pick me up and take me home. Oh. Oh, my God. That is quite the offer. There is no way. You're serious right now. I'm totally serious. I'll send the deed to the radio station. They can see that it's in your name. And I've sent the title of being to the radio station. They can verify it. And if you like or don't like me, the car is yours no matter what. Oh, my God. So you're offering her a car for a date? Not just a car, any car she wants. Oh, my God. Oh, man. Okay. I'm excited. I don't even know what to say. I mean, well, you should say yes. That's what I think. But Monica, would you go on a second date with Roger? We'll pay for dinner. We don't need to. It sounds so lame now, but Roger's offering you a Car if you'll go out with him. I don't know. This is the craziest thing that has ever happened to me. Exactly. So you might as well jump on this front train. It gets better and better. This is just the start. Yeah, so I know. What are you gonna buy her next? A private jet? Like listen, make your next move, your best move. What do you think Monica? He is offering me a car, any car that I want just to go on one date with him. Yeah, that's exactly what it is. Okay, Monica, it's what? One date one day and a new car and not only a new car, I'll fill up the gas tank and that's better. Really expensive. I just I think you're going down a slippery slope if you do it. If you say yes, it sounds so good, but I just I don't think so. A slippery slope made of money baby. Come on, stop. Stop trying to throw a monkey wrench and everything. Oh my gosh, what do I do? I don't know. You have to decide for yourself. I think curiosity has gotten the best of me. I'm gonna say yes. Yes. Oh, no, successful second date. Oh my God. Congratulations, Roger. Thank you very much. Yeah, and Monica, even more congratulations to you. We don't get a lot of people saying yes to the second dates because they're usually weird. I guess what it takes is somebody getting a Car in order to make it happen, you gotta make an offer they don't refuse. Yeah, I am freaking out right now that this is actually happening. Well, will you guys keep us updated on what happens, please? Okay. Will you send us pictures of your new car? Yeah, I wanna ride. Oh my gosh. Okay. All right. Well, hey, Roger, before we go, I do have a question for you. Yes. Do you need any friends? You're so crazy. You guys are my friends now. Okay.

So I treated her exactly like I treat my other friends. With boundaries. Tara and I had been together for two years, living together, for one. We were talking about future plans, her sister's wedding next summer, where I was supposed to be her plus one. Then on a random Thursday evening, she sat me down for the talk. I love you, but I'm not in love with you anymore. She said, I think we should transition to being friends. Get along so well, have the same friend group. We'd make amazing friends. But not amazing partners. Here's what killed me. She said all this while already having packed a bag. Her friend Marissa was picking her up in an hour. She planned this whole thing down to having somewhere to stay, already got an exit strategy. I said, we're adults. We're friends. We can make this work. I sat there processing. Two years living together, talking about kids someday. Now she wants to be buddies? Okay. I said, yeah, let's be friends. She actually smiled, relieved, like I just agreed to her perfect plan where she gets to dump me but keep all the benefits of having me in her life. The next morning, I did exactly what Tara asked. I treated her like a friend. That's when I Learned she had a very different definition of friendship than I did. First text came at 7:00am. Could you Drop off my work laptop? Sure. I'll leave it at the front desk of your office Monday. Can't you bring it by Marissa's? I need it for the weekend. I've got plans. Monday works better. She didn't like that. But what was she going to say? We're just friends now. Week two, Tara started cracking. She showed up at the apartment while I was at work. Still using her key. Helped herself to groceries, did laundry, took a shower. I texted her, I'll need the key back. My friends don't have keys to my place. This is ridiculous. We live together. We used to live together. Now we're friends. Different relationship, different boundaries. She came by that evening, furious. You changed the locks. You no longer live here. Here's a box of your stuff. I'm treating you exactly like I treat my friends. None of them have keys to my place. But I'm not just any friend. According to you, that's exactly what you are. The real kicker came at game night with our friend group. I showed up solo. She showed up with some dude named Connor from yoga, clearly trying to make me jealous. I shook his hand, welcomed him, then proceeded to destroy everyone at code names while paying them zero attention. Halfway through the night, Tara cornered me. You don't even care that I'm here with someone else? Why? Why would I? We're friends. Friends date people. She couldn't answer because there was no answer. That Didn't admit she wanted me to pine for her while she found herself. But the best part, her bestie Marissa had been extra friendly all night. Kept finding excuses to talk to me, laugh at my jokes. This morning, Tara texted. What was that with you and Marissa? We were just talking. Friends talk. She's my best friend. And I'm your friend, too, right? Friends can be friends with each other's friends. By week three, Connor from yoga had ghosted Tara. Meanwhile, Marissa invited me to a comedy show. The date was fantastic. She was actually hilarious. Something I'd

My brother Jake has this girlfriend named Becca who literally cannot stand not being the center of attention for five minutes. Every family dinner, every holiday, every gathering, she finds a way to make it about her. Last Thanksgiving, she announced she was pregnant right when my dad was about to carve the Turkey. Turns out she wasn't even pregnant. Just wanted to see everyone's reactions. So when I was planning my wedding to my fiance Ryan, I knew I had to do something about the Becca situation. This was going to be my one day. The one day that was supposed to be about me and Ryan starting our life together. I called Jake about three months before the wedding. Hey, so about the wedding I started. I need to ask you something kind of awkward. What's up? He said, and I could hear him eating cereal in the background. I really don't want Becca there. I know that sounds harsh, but she always makes everything about herself, and I just can't deal with that stress. On my wedding day, the line went quiet for, like, 10 seconds, and Jake exploded. Are you serious right now? You're uninviting my girlfriend from your wedding? I'm not uninviting her because she was never invited in the first place. The invitation was just for you. That's the same thing. We've been together for two years. She's basically family. I tried To explain that it wasn't personal, that I just wanted one drama free day. But Jake wasn't having it. He said if Becca couldn't come, then he wouldn't come either. I told him that was his choice. Think he changed his mind? He didn't. But here's where it gets crazy. The day of my wedding, I'm getting my makeup done in the bridal suite when my cousin Madison bursts in. Uh, you need to see this, he says, shoving her phone in my face. It's Becca's Instagram story. She's posted, like, 15 videos of herself getting all dressed up, doing her makeup, picking out jewelry. The caption on the last one says, can't wait to celebrate love today. With a bunch of heart emojis and the location tagged as our wedding venue. My heart drops. He's coming anyway. Madison nods. Jake's outside right now, arguing with your dad about it. He says he changed his mind and decided to bring her. I'm standing there in my wedding dress, half my makeup done, and I have to deal with.

What thing? I asked, confused, because everything seemed present and accounted for. Your thing isn't there. She was staring at my junk with this weird, concerned look. I tap my stick on her cheek, trying to be funny. I think you're staring right at it. No, not that thing. Hold on. She reached out and started examining me more closely through my boxers. And she said the words that ruined my birthday. Holy shit! I think you should get to a hospital. She made me pull up my pants and grab my keys. No explanation, just pure panic on her face. We got in my car, and she insisted on driving because I was already freaking out. The whole ride to the emergency room, she kept glancing at me with this worried expression. What's wrong? Just tell me. I was starting to imagine the worst. I gripped the steering wheel tighter. There's no easy way to say this, but you only have one ball. What? I actually yelled it so loud, she swerved a little. There's only one ball. One nut, one marble, whatever you want to call it. There's supposed to be two, and you've got one. She was talking fast, like she needed to get it all out. My mind was racing. How would I never notice this? I've been living in this body for 21 years and somehow missed that? I Was anatomically incomplete. My hands were shaking as I tried to process what she was saying. Did it fall out? Was I born this way? What happened to my jelly beans? At the hospital, they took me back pretty quickly once I explained the situation. The doctor examined me and confirmed what Sienna had discovered. I definitely only had one testicle. But what he said next made even less sense. According to your medical records, this makes perfect sense. It's all here from the operation. He was reading from his computer screen. What operation? I've never had an operation in my life. I was completely lost. Now the doctor looked up, surprised. You should probably take this up with your parents, but according to this, you had surgery when you were 7 years old. I called my dad right there from the hospital bed. He answered on the second ring, all cheerful because he knew it was my birthday. But when I explained where I was and what I just Learned, his voice changed completely. I heard him say to my mom in the background, honey, he knows I'm gonna have to come clean to him now. My stomach dropped. Come clean about what? What else had they been hiding from me? My dad got back on the phone and took a deep breath. When you were seven years old, you had testicular cancer. We caught it early, and it was completely operable. But they had to remove one of Your test

At 5 7 and 140 pounds, I wasn't exactly the most intimidating. Drunk guys at bars always picked me when they wanted to look tough in front of women. So when I saw this 6 2 gym bro marching over to where I was chatting with a pretty brunette, I already knew how this would go. He wedged himself between us, his massive frame completely blocking me out. Didn't even look at me, just turned his broad back like I was furniture. Let me get you a real drink, beautiful, he said. Flag down the bartender, not whatever this little guy was boring you with. She glanced around his shoulder at me, clearly uncomfortable. Actually, we were just. Trust me. He cut her off, placing a protective hand on the bar in front of her, creating a wall. You need someone who can actually take care of you. He ordered her a martini without asking, then finally acknowledged my existence with a dismissive glance. You can go now, buddy. When I didn't move, he shifted his weight, using his size to push me further down the bar. The edge of the counter dug into my ribs. Still, I stayed put, sipping my beer. He'd expected me to scurry away by now. He turned to me fully for the first time, looking me up and down with theatrical disgust, asked If I I was deaf or something. When I calmly said I was just finishing my drink, his hand shot out and swiped my glasses off my face. They clattered across the bar. Everything went blurry. He made jokes about me not being able to see up to his. I told the girl, maybe that's why I hadn't gotten the hint. I stayed still, breathing normally. 10 years of training had taught me the most important lesson. Real fighters don't fight in bars. Too much liability. Too much to lose. My instructor certification, my gym, potential lawsuits, all gone over some drunk idiot. I reached for my glasses with measured movements, slid them further away with one finger, told me to leave them. I walked around him to retrieve them, keeping everything neutral. When I sat back down with my glasses, he spun around to face the entire bar and announced loudly that we had a creeper situation. His voice boomed over the music as he pointed at me with his beer bottle, claiming I've been bothering this nice lady for an hour. The brunette tried to protest, but he interrupted, putting a possessive hand on her shoulder that made her flinch, told everyone not to worry, he had it handled. His buddies at a corner table started laughing and shouting. Someone asked if I was in middle school, grinned, and turned to the bartender, suggesting I should be carded again because I looked about 12. The brunette pulled away. From his hand, but he kept talking over her, telling her she didn't have to be polite anymore. Half the bar was watching now, some people whispering, shooting me suspicious looks. My reputation at this place where I've been a regular for two years, was being destroyed in real time. Then he decided to demonstrate my weakness. He grabbed my wrist, suddenly, holding it up for the bar to see, while comparing it to his 12 year old nephew's arms. I didn't resist, keeping my breathing steady as he squeezed harder, his thumb pressing into the pressure point. He yanked me off the bar stool, effortlessly, spinning me around to show the girl what would happen if real danger showed up, then shoved me back against the bar. Not hard enough to be considered assault, but enough to make his point. The edge dug into my spine. He stood there waiting, telling me to push back, show her I was a real man. I stayed relaxed, hands at my sides, no aggressive stance, nothing that could justify what he wanted to do. His face darkened at my non reaction, called me pathetic. He turned to the girl, explaining this was why she needed someone like him around. Painted scenarios of what could happen. Happened with me just standing there, doing nothing. If he was actually dangerous. The brunette stood up, said she was leaving. He grabbed her wrist, immediately, insisting he'd walk her to her car because the streets weren't Safe. Her voice was firm, but I could hear the fear underneath. When she told him to let go, he tightened his grip slightly, still smiling, saying he was just trying to help. She tried to pull away, but he held firm, told her to relax. He was just being a gentleman. His grip tightened enough to make her gasp. She was getting genuinely scared now, panic in her voice as she pushed against his chest with her free hand. That's when something shifted in his eyes. The drunk bravado turned into something ugly.

My mother is the most baby obsessed psycho I've ever met. Starting when I was 8 years old, she made me and my sister Daniela wear these pregnancy simulation suits for hours every single day, 20 pounds of sand strapped to our stomachs while we practice breathing exercises and watch birthing videos. If we complained about back pain, she'd add more weight and tell us real mothers don't whine. She even made us practice breastfeeding with these creepy little dolls that would cry if you didn't hold them right. While I spent every session plotting my escape, Daniela embraced it as if it was her one true purpose. She'd waddle around the house with perfect posture, rubbing her fake belly and talking to it out loud. By the time she turned 16, she was begging mom to let her be a practice surrogate for her infertile work friends. And when she turned 18, mom threw her a massive party, not for graduating high school, but for signing her first surrogacy contract. Everyone was calling her a blessing and an angel while I sat in the corner feeling like I was at a livestock auction. Within three years, Daniela had carried three babies for three different couples. Each time she came home from the hospital, mom would parade her around town like she'd won a Nobel Prize. Look at my generous daughter giving the gift of life. Meanwhile, I was getting a biomedical degree, volunteering At women's shelters and learning about bodily autonomy. But none of that mattered. Such a waste of a perfectly good uterus, mom would tell anyone who'd listen. Her sister has blessed three families while this one hordes her fertility for herself. The most terrifying part was watching Daniela deteriorate after her fourth pregnancy. At 22, she could barely walk without pain. Her hips were destroyed. She had constant infections and her hair was falling out in chunks. When I tried to talk to her about it, she grabbed my hands with tears in her eyes. Maria, this is what I was made for. My body is a vessel for miracles. Why can't you understand that? That's when I knew she was gone. So I played along just enough to keep mom off my back, told her I was considering pregnancy, wore looser clothes to family events, even googled fertility clinics in front of her, all while secretly taking the LSAT and applying to law schools across the country. Lol. I specialized in reproductive rights and medical ethics, spending years helping women escape forced pregnancy situations. By 28, I was finally making a difference. So when mom invited me to Daniela's Celebration dinner, I figured it was just another pregnancy announcement. Boy, was I wrong. Turns out it was an effing intervention. Sweetie, you're not getting any younger, mom announced while Daniela sat beside her belly, swollen with pregnancy No. 5. So I've taken the liberty of starting your fertility treatments. Before I could respond, she pulled out a syringe filled with hormones. Just a little boost to get those eggs flowing. I jumped back, but Daniela grabbed my arms from behind. Please, Maria, just try it. I've already found the perfect couple for your first baby. I screamed and fought, but mom was already coming at me with the needle. That's when I noticed the other syringes on the table. They've been planning this. As mom punched the needle into my thigh, I felt the cold liquid burn through my muscle. Within minutes, my vision blurred and my ovaries felt like they were on fire. Through the haze, I heard mom on the phone. Yes, started the protocol. She'll be ready for harvest in two weeks. That's when I realized this wasn't just about family pressure anymore. This was trafficking. I woke up in the ICU with ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome, so severe they nearly had to remove everything. My mom stood towering over me. We only brought you here because we wanted to save your womb, was the first thing she said. I pressed the red button for the nurse. We took one look at my mom and escorted her out to perform private examinations. As soon as we were alone, I felt even worse because she wrapped her arms around me and asked if I was okay. I broke down crying because the whole thing.

And when she turned 18, mom threw her a massive party, not for graduating high school, but for signing her first surrogacy contract. Everyone was calling her a blessing and an angel, while I sat in the corner feeling like I was at a livestock auction. Within three years, Daniella had carried three babies for three different couples. Each time she came home from the hospital, mom would parade her around town like she'd won a Nobel Prize. Look at my generous daughter giving the gift of life. Meanwhile, I was getting a biomedical degree. Volunteering at women's shelters and learning about bodily autonomy. But none of that mattered. Such a waste of a perfectly good uterus. I would tell anyone who'd listen her sister has blessed three families, while this one hoards her fertility for herself. The most terrifying part was watching Daniela deteriorate after her fourth pregnancy. At 22, she could barely walk without pain, her hips were destroyed, she had constant infections, and her hair was falling out in chunks. When I tried to talk to her about it, she grabbed my hands with tears in her eyes. Maria, this is what I was made for. My body is a vessel for miracles. Why can't you understand that? That's when I knew she was gone. So I played along just enough to keep mom off my back. Told her I was considering pregnancy, wore looser clothes to family events, even googled fertility clinics in front of her, all while secretly taking the LSAT and applying to law schools across the country. Lol. I specialized in reproductive rights and medical ethics, spending years helping women escape forced pregnancy situations. By 28, I was finally making a difference. So when mom invited me to Daniela's Celebration dinner, I figured it was just another pregnancy announcement. Boy, was I wrong. Turns out it was an effing intervention. Sweetie, you're not getting any younger, mom announced while Daniela sat beside her belly swollen with pregnancy No. 5. So I've taken the liberty of starting your fertility Treatments. Before I could respond, she pulled out a syringe filled with hormones. Just a little boost to get those eggs flowing. I jumped back, but Daniela grabbed my arms from behind. Please, Maria, just try it. I've already found the perfect couple for your first baby. I screamed and fought, but mom was already coming at me with the needle. That's when I noticed the other syringes on the table. They've been planning this. Mom punched the needle into my thigh. I felt the cold liquid burn through my muscle. Within minutes, my vision blurred, and my ovaries felt like they were on fire. Through the haze, I heard mom on the phone. Yes. Started the protocol. She'll be ready for harvest in two weeks. That's when I realized this wasn't just about family pressure anymore. This was trafficking. I woke up in the ICU with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome so severe, they nearly had to remove everything. My mom stood towering over me. We only brought you here because we wanted to save your womb, was the first thing she said. I pressed the red button for the nurse. We took one look at my mom and escorted her out to perform private examinations. As soon as we were alone, I felt even worse because she wrapped her arms around me and asked if I was okay. I broke down crying because the whole thing.

At 5 7 and 140 pounds, I wasn't exactly the most intimidating drunk. Guys at bars always picked me when they wanted to look tough in front of women. So when I saw this 6 2 gym bro marching over to where I was chatting with a pretty brunette, I already knew how this would go. He wedged himself between us, his massive frame completely blocking me out. Didn't even look at me, just turned his broad back like I was furniture. Let me get you a real drink, beautiful, he said. Flag down the bartender, not whatever this little guy was boring you with. She glanced around his shoulder at me, clearly uncomfortable. Actually, we were just, trust me. He cut her off, placing a protective hand on the bar in front of her, creating a wall. You need someone who can actually take care of you. He ordered her a martini without asking, then finally acknowledged my existence with a dismissive glance. You can go now, buddy. When I didn't move, he shifted his weight, using his size to push me further down the bar. The edge of the counter dug into my ribs. Still, I stayed put, sipping my beer. He'd expected me to scurry away by now. He turned to me fully for the first time, looking me up and down with theatrical disgust, asked If I, I was deaf or something. When I calmly said I was just finishing my drink, his hand shot out and swiped my glasses off my face. They clattered across the bar. Everything went blurry. He made jokes about me not being able to see up to his height, told the girl maybe that's why I hadn't gotten the hint. I stayed still, breathing normally. 10 years of training had taught me the most important lesson, real fighters don't fight in bars. Much liability, too much to lose my instructor certification, my gym, potential lawsuits all gone over some drunk idiot. I reached for my glasses. With measured movements, he slid them further away with one finger, told me to leave them. I walked around him to retrieve them, keeping up everything neutral. When I sat back down with my glasses, he spun around to face the entire bar and announced loudly that we had a creeper situation. His voice boomed over the music as he pointed at me with his beer bottle, claiming I've been bothering this nice lady for an hour. The brunette tried to protest, but he interrupted, putting a possessive hand on her shoulder that made her flinch, told everyone not to worry, he had it handled. His buddies at a corner table started laughing and shouting. Someone asked if I was in middle school. He grinned and turned to the bartender, suggesting I should be carded again because I looked about twice the brunette. Pulled away from his hand but he kept talking over her, telling her she didn't have to be polite anymore. Half the bar was watching now. Some people whispering, shooting me suspicious looks. My reputation at this place where I've been a regular for two years was being destroyed in real time. Then he decided to demonstrate my weakness. He grabbed my wrist, suddenly holding it up for the bar to see while comparing it to his 12 year old nephew's arms. I didn't resist, keeping my breathing steady as he squeezed harder, his thumb pressing into the pressure point. He yanked me off the bar stool, effortlessly spinning me around to show the girl what would happen if real danger showed up. Then shoved me back against the bar. Not hard enough to be considered assault, but enough to make his point. The edge dug into my spine. He stood there waiting, telling me to push back, show her I was a real man. I stayed relaxed, hands at my sides, no aggressive stance, nothing that could justify what he wanted to do. His face darkened at my non reaction, called me pathetic. He turned to the girl explaining this was why she needed someone like him around, painted scenarios of what could happen with me just standing there doing nothing if he was actually dangerous. The brunette stood up, said she was leaving. He grabbed her wrist immediately insisting he'd walk her to her car because the streets Weren't safe. Her voice was firm, but I could hear the fear underneath. When she told him to let go, he tightened his grip slightly, still smiling, saying he was just trying to help. She tried to pull away, but he held firm, told her to relax. He was just being a gentleman. His grip tightened enough to make her gasp. She was getting genuinely scared now. Panic in her voice as she pushed against his chest with her free hand. That's when something shifted in his eyes. The drunk bravado turned into something ugly.

My mother is the most baby obsessed psycho I've ever met. Starting when I was 8 years old, she made me and my sister Daniela wear these pregnancy simulation suits for hours every single day, 20 pounds of sand strapped to our stomachs while we practice breathing exercises and watch birthing videos. If we complained about back pain, she'd add more weight and tell us real mothers don't whine. She even made us practice breastfeeding with these creep be little dolls that would cry if you didn't hold them right.

When I was 16, my dad told me I had to get a job or he'd kick me out of the house, and the only one I could find was at Build a bear. On my first day, I had to learn all the happy dances you do when a kid comes in, and after an hour of that, I was completely on my own. My manager left me there by myself, so I was really nervous. But I noticed a couple come in, and the woman was very pregnant. They didn't have a kid with them, but I still helped them pick out a bear along with a fancy heart that had a heartbeat. They still didn't look happy at all, so I tried to cheer her up and made the woman do the happy dance before I stuffed the bear for them. I could see they were both still really upset and not knowing what to do, I made the mistake of asking her if she was okay. She just looks up at me and told me they were there to make a bear for her baby to be buried with, because they had just found out their baby's heart wasn't beating anymore. I immediately stopped trying to make her dance and could barely keep it together as I made the bear for her. It took everything I had to keep a smile as I helped them pay But as soon as they left, I ran to the back and completely bawled my eyes out. My manager came back to the store a minute later, saw the huge line, and then found me crying in the back. I tried to explain what happened, but he just told me to get out because I was fired.

I was born with cerebral palsy and I believed my mom every time she told me it was cool to have it. I thought people were jealous of the way I walked because nobody else looked like me. That completely changed when I got to high school because they couldn't afford to send me to a special school anymore. I was the only black kid and I got bullied on the first day there. However, that wasn't anything compared to the principal's son. He knew he could get away with anything, so he constantly made fun of me for the way I moved and talked. And since every teacher was too afraid to punish him, he didn't stop. He kicked my canes out from under me a few times. And when my mom asked how I got the bruises from falling, I lied and said my shoes made me trip. Well, they saved up and bought me special walking shoes and it made me so happy the first day I wore them to school, that kid took them and threw them in the garbage. By the time I knew where they were, it was too late. And the only person who saw what happened was our math teacher. This guy hated our principal and hated his son even more. He knew what he did and in that moment didn't care about what was going to happen. He took that kid. Into his classroom and yelled so loud, everyone in the school heard it. The kid left the room crying and went straight to his dad. A week later, he lost his job and could never teach again. But the day he was clearing his stuff out of his room, he gave me a box. It was another pair of the shoes he had bought for me, and I still have them 30 years later.

When my daughter was 5, she begged me to put up Christmas lights for an entire day. She was literally crying because I was leaving for a work trip the next day and she told me Santa wouldn't come if our house wasn't decorated. It was really icy and snowing that day, but my wife told me to just do it. So I told her fine. I got the ladder and climbed up and my daughter passed me the lights and the colors she wanted. Right before we were almost finished, the slipped out from underneath me. I fell and hit my head on the concrete hard and remember the sound of her screaming. I didn't wake up until I was in the hospital later that day and felt the worst pain in my neck and back. I tried to feel for the bandages on my head, but strangely I didn't feel anything. I was really confused but barely managed to sit up and noticed I couldn't move my legs. I looked up and saw a nurse walk in the room and she looked really surprised. Five more people came in and all started asking me questions. I was really worried because I still couldn't move my feet no matter how hard I tried. I didn't know what was going on until an hour later when my wife finally got there. I was so happy. To see and didn't think anything about her. In tears, I asked who the girl she was with was because she was also crying. And when she walked closer, I made the most shocking realization of my life. This 13 year old was my daughter. And they broke the news. I was in a coma for almost nine years. I realized I had missed her entire childhood. I was paralyzed. My wife had remarried. But what hurt the most was when I went home to our house and I looked up at our roof. I broke down because those lights were still up.

That night, I lost them both. After five years, I finally gained the courage to try again. And when I heard about two kids who came from an abuse, abusive family at the adoption center, I filled out an application. They both lived in a van with their mom for years.

Their mom treated them so horribly that when I asked them what they wanted for Christmas, they didn't know what I was talking about. They had never heard of Santa Claus. They didn't believe a man was actually gonna come bring them presents. When I told them on Christmas Eve, I thought, they kept running over to the window to look for him. I told them he wasn't coming until they were sleeping, but they said they were looking for the police to come since they always came to get them on Christmas Eve. I wasn't gonna let them see me crying after that. But the next morning I woke up to Both of them laughing because they saw the footprints I left on the carpet and the milk and cookies were gone. They didn't even care about the presents. They just kept saying, he's real, he's real.

We were almost there when somebody turned left without enough time and hit us. My husband and I were completely unharmed, but they hit the door.

She cried when she watched her brother go on the swings while she couldn't, and constantly got stared at by other kids her age. I've caught my husband crying in the garage at night, thinking it was his fault. I thought he just wanted to be alone, but it turns out he was actually planning something. Yesterday was her birthday, and the gift she opened wasn't anything like what she was expecting. Instead, I found out what he had spent months designing.

I was only looking away for 30 seconds and the boy was gone. I ran out of the room but he wasn't anywhere in sight. I was panicking because I just had to watch him for a few minutes and couldn't find him now. I called security and they told me where they had him. I went down to the Organ donation office. And there he was. Apparently, he was asking the girls at the front desk to give his sister one of his eyes because she lost hers and he didn't need both of his. It was so wholesome. And after the girl found out, she'd never see again. That at least made her smile.

My math teacher thought I didn't speak Spanish. Big mistake. I was born in California, but my parents came from Colombia. When they were teenagers, at home, we spoke Spanish every single day. My mom would cook while telling me stories about her childhood in Bogota. My dad would watch soccer games and yell at the TV in Spanish. But at school, I always spoke English. It just felt more natural with my friends. Miss Graham was new to our school district. She transferred from some rural area upstate where apparently nobody looked like me. From Day 1, she made comments about the diversity programs and how standards were dropping, but she said it quietly, thinking none of us understood. During my second week in her algebra class, I was presenting a group project about linear equations. I made a small error while explaining one of the steps. No big deal happens to everyone. But Miss Graham leaned over to the teaching assistant and whispered in Spanish, Otra parea suzhenten nuca es walsa. Another lazy one. Her people never try hard. I froze. Did this woman really just call me lazy in Spanish right in front of me? I kept my face neutral and pretended I didn't understand, but inside I was furious. The worst part was she had this smug smile like she'd gotten away with something clever. I went home that night and told my mom everything. My mom works. Two jobs, cleaning offices at night and doing alterations during the day. She doesn't take disrespect from anybody, especially not some teacher insulting her daughter. But instead of marching to the principal's office like I expected, she sat down at our kitchen table and started planning. Mihow, we're going to be smart about this, she said. Keep track of everything, she says. Write it down with dates and times. And whatever you do, don't let her know you speak Spanish. For the next two weeks, I played completely dumb in math class. Miss Graham kept making comments in Spanish, thinking she was safe. She called me and other Hispanic students lazy, said our parents probably didn't care about education, even joke to the ta that we'd probably drop out anyway. I documented everything in a notebook word for word. The parent teacher conferences were scheduled for a Thursday evening. My mom took off work early, which was a big deal because she needed every hour. We walked into that classroom together and Miss Graham immediately got that condescending look teachers get when they think they're dealing with parents who don't speak English. Ah, we might need to call for a translator, Miss Graham said to the assistant principal who was also in the room for these meetings. She said it slowly and loudly.

In 10th grade, I accidentally showed up to school in banana pajamas. Full set pants top, tiny cartoon bananas dancing everywhere. It wasn't a dare. I just overslept, grabbed what was on the floor, and ran out the door like my house was on fire. Thought I'd get clowned. Instead, some senior gave me a nod and said, respect the comfort, bro. By lunch, three kids had changed into Pjs. One guy showed up in a Spider Man onesie. A girl brought a weighted blanket and called it her emotional support cloak. The next day, chaos. Half the school was in pajama mode. Slippers, eye masks. Someone brought a neck pillow and took a nap during chemistry class. The principal tried to shut it down with a serious intercom announcement. This is school, not a sleepover. Please dress appropriately. So naturally, then, next day, someone came in a Snuggie. The media class made a fake trailer called revenge of the Pjs. It had slow motion shots of kids marching in unicorn onesies while the school anthem played on kazoo. By Friday, it was official. We had sparked the Pajama Rebellion. I didn't start it on purpose, but I became the face of it. Now, once a month, this school has cozy day. There's even a framed photo of me in banana PJs hanging in the student council room. Moral of the story sometimes you don't need a plan to become A legend. You just need to sleep through your alarm.

My cousin forgot her laptop at my place and begged me to drop it off at Lincoln High. I walk into the office like a normal person and say, I'm here for Miss Taylor. The secretary looks panicked and goes, you're the sub, right, for room 2:00 o four. Before I can say anything, she slaps a badge on me that says Mister J, Substitute teacher, and shoves a clipboard in my hands. Next thing I know, I'm standing in front of 30 high school sophomores. A kid in the front goes, you the guy? I say, I'm whoever you need me to be. They go absolutely silent. I panic and blurt, alright, class today, we're learning zombie apocalypse survival. Suddenly, everyone's in. They're building barricades out of desks. One kid uses a stapler like it's a grenade. A girl creates a barter system using gum. Then the real sub walks in frazzled, holding an ID badge in a Starbucks. One student screams, it's starting. Another yells, she's infected. Look at her eyes. Kid hurls an eraser like it's a smoke bomb. Real sub tries to explain, but a student calmly says, Mr J has it under control and hands her a tissue like it's a peace offering. She slowly backs out of the room. No one breaks character. By the end, the principal walks in, sees kids drawing escape routes on the whiteboard and just Nods, innovative. That night, I get an email, we'd like to bring you in next Thursday. Theme, alien invasion preparedness. I texted back, only if I get a whistle this time.

And you said no. My daughter had one of these encounters and it worked out well. She was a psychiatric nurse working on the crisis team but hoping to be able to work in the perinatal area. Unfortunately, there was no perinatal service in that area. One day she happened to be in the office at the hospital when a man came in and said, look, my daughter needs an impatient mental health bed now. She said, you could be right, sir, but I have just had a patient admitted to the last available one. We'll do what we can until another becomes available. He said, do you know who I am? She said she had no idea. He told her he was a senior politician in the cabinet. I will not name him as he was a good constituency MP. She told him that if mental health services were not so underfunded, she probably could have helped his daughter faster. She said, this is the sharp end of the funding decisions you make in cabinet and gave him the phone number of the local private clinic. He went away clearly annoyed, but a few weeks later she was owned by the head of mental health for her county and was told that more money had been released to set up a perinatal service and they wanted her to set it up and run it. Which she did. I don't think it was a coincidence that the money suddenly became available. Whether or not, he said, and I want that bulshy woman who cared enough about her patients to take me to task to run it, we don't know. This was some years ago now, and I admire him for doing something about it.

I have four significantly older siblings. All of them are now married. I was not invited to any of their weddings because each of them had a child free wedding. I, of course, thought I'd be the only exception as I am their sibling. But no. My oldest sibling first had a child free wedding and then the others decided to follow. When my oldest brother got married, I was 10 years old, so sure, I kind of understood why they didn't invite me, but I was still extremely upset. My oldest brother got married to a woman I really love and I couldn't even be there to witness it. The other brother got married when I was 12 years old. Yet again I wasn't invited. I still sort of understood, but when I was 12 years old, I was a very well behaved child and at the same time, his sibling. My sister got married when I was 15 years old. At first she didn't want a child free wedding, but all of the family members convinced her because OMG, it's so refreshing to be in a wedding where children don't bring havoc. So she decided to cut out everyone who was under 16 years old. When I asked if I could be an exception, since I was 15 at the time and her sister, she said no with a very serious tone. If We make an exception for you. What about other children? It's not fair! I got upset and screamed that it wasn't fair not to participate in any of my siblings weddings. My parents got upset with me and grounded me for six months. Lastly, my brother got married when I was 17 years old. I thought surely I'd be invited to this one. But at that point I didn't care. I knew it was going to be a child free wedding and somehow I wouldn't be invited as I guessed. I was right. I didn't ask or beg. My step cousin who just turned 18 just made the cut and I didn't. Well, as I said, I didn't care. I sent a quick congrats text and that was it. My parents got furious about why I didn't even congratulate them properly. I just ignored them and spent all the time in my room with my now soon to be husband. Since I'm getting married now, I decided none of them will be at my wedding since I wasn't allowed to be at theirs when they didn't get the invitation.

Instead of waiting for my husband and son to come home to celebrate with me, I received a video from my husband's first girlfriend. In the video, my husband and my son were with her, and my son was hugging her, saying he wished she could be his mother. After seeing that, instead of calling him to confront him, I silently packed my suitcase and signed the divorce papers. It was unusual for my husband Dominic to come home at midnight and find the house completely dark. No matter what time it was, I always left a light on for him. That night, he handed our son Grayson over to the housekeeper and went straight to the master bedroom. I was sitting on the sofa with a carefully packed suitcase by my side and the I divorce agreement on the coffee table in front of me. Dominic frowned. Paisley, what is this? Another one of your dramatics? I didn't have the strength for his criticism. My voice came out calm and firm. I want a divorce! His face showed disbelief. Why? Because I forgot your birthday? It doesn't matter, I replied, pushing the divorce agreement toward him. Sign it. Let's end this. He flipped through the pages mockingly. You're leaving empty handed? Where will you go without me? A bitter laugh escaped my lips. He was so sure he had me trapped. Thinking I had no one in hierofel and nothing to hold on to, I pushed the Papers even closer. Sign it. Don't waste time. For a moment he hesitated, then his voice hardened. Fine. Divorce it is. But Sonny's custody is not negotiable. You won't get him. Suddenly Grayson appeared, looking at me with tears streaming down his cheeks. I'm staying with dad. I don't want to go with you. You're a horrible mother, a witch! That's enough, Grayson! Dominic snapped. But Grayson's rage didn't subside. If you hadn't gotten in the way of dad and Marissa, she'd be my mom now. I cut the tension with that same cold voice. I don't care, Grayson. I don't care about anything. I just want the divorce. That word left Dominic in silence. He clenched his jaw and his eyes darkened with frustration. Are you sure about this? I tossed the pen onto the table. Sign it. Let's end this. Dominic's frustration gave way to a flicker of doubt. Before he could sign, I grabbed my copy, took my suitcase, and headed for the door. Tomorrow at 9 a m. Sharp at City hall. Don't be late, I said without hesitation. Just as I was about to walk out, Dominic grabbed my wrist tightly. Let go! I said coldly. He sneered. In such a rush to leave? You already have a lover. I looked him straight in the eyes. If you don't want to wait for part 2, you can watch the full story on my YouTube channel.

One day my daughter came back from school and ran into my arms like she was scared. I could feel her shaking so I took her inside and made some French toast, which was her favorite food. I thought she just had a really bad day and missed being at home. But I couldn't have been more wrong. Once she calmed down, she told me, Mommy, something happened today and I think I'm supposed to tell you about it. An uneasy knot formed itself in my heart when she told me that the school counselor had called her into his office for a special game. He handed my daughter a stuffed unicorn and told her that this new game was very popular with the children, which made my daughter excited and eager to learn. Then the counselor made her point the unicorn between his legs and push on it repeatedly. My daughter told me how he made weird faces at times and then closed his eyes and leaned back. Towards the end, I was so horrified and felt a wave of nausea rush through my body so I had to go to the bathroom and throw up. What kind of sick person would make a 7 year old girl do this kind of thing? Not to mention he worked at a school and it was me who willfully sent my daughter near his vicinity. Bouncing between blaming myself and wanting to burn the entire world. My husband was no longer with us, so it was up to me to stand up for my daughter. I don't know what made me approach the school administration before the police, but that's exactly what I did. And the school administration laughed at me, saying that my daughter was clearly playing a prank. They said they had heard other students make similar jokes about the school counselor and said that parents should teach their kids not to lie. By the time I made it to the police station, the school had already called them and explained the situation. They thought I was a crazy mother who was trying to give merit to my daughter's filthy lie. I had looked straight into my daughter's eyes when she told me the story, so I knew she was telling the truth. But no one wanted to believe me. And I felt like I was in a nightmare. This is when I remembered something important and ran back home to open my jewelry safe. Inside there was a note that I hadn't looked at for a long time. You see, although I was currently a doctor, I had been a very inexperienced nurse at one point. And one time a very stern looking man with a lot of face tattoos walked into our hospital with a bullet wound. No other nurse wanted to treat him since he looks so scary. So they Sent me. I convinced myself that everyone deserves treatment and cleaned his wounds with the utmost concentration. I even engaged him in conversation and joked about how he should stay away from bullets in the future. When it was all over, the guy thanked me and handed me a note with his phone number on it. He said, if you ever need someone taken care of, I won't ask for any payment. I typed in that phone number and to my surprise, it actually connected. I told him who I was and he said, I remember you.

My mom kept borrowing money from my savings account without asking. Started small when I was 15, 20 here, 50 there. Always promised, I'll pay you back next week, sweetheart. I was saving for my first car, working weekends at Scoops Ice Cream downtown. The job absolutely sucked. Sticky floors covered in melted ice cream, screaming kids having sugar meltdowns and my chain smoking manager, Derek, who reeked of cigarettes. After two grueling years of scooping rocky road and mopping chocolate spills every night, I'd saved almost $3,000. Then I checked my balance at the ATM. 8, 47, 32, my heart stopped. I drove straight home, found mom making fancy curried coffee with expensive pods she claimed we couldn't afford. Mom, where's my money? She didn't look. Oh, honey, I needed it for groceries. Things are tight since the divorce. You'll get it back. But groceries don't cost $2,000. I started watching her spending. New coach purse from the outlet mall, weekly salon appointments for highlights, fancy dinners with club friends every Friday, all while telling me we had to tighten our belts and couldn't afford name brand cereal I liked. I felt sick. This was my money from my job dealing with brain freeze headaches in that walk in freezer every single night. When I confronted her again, she got defensive. I'm your mother, Jessica. I've spent way more than 3,000 raising you over 17 years. Consider this paying me back. For all those diapers and formula. That comment made my blood boil. That's when I knew I had to be smart about this. During lunch break, I went to First National Bank and asked to speak with someone about my account to tell her. Margaret pulled up my statements, her face changing as she scrolled through months of transactions. Your mom's been withdrawing money almost weekly for six months, I whispered. Since you're a minor, this is technically a joint account, so it's legal. But you can open your own when you turn 18 next month. She leaned closer. Until then, you could withdraw everything and keep it somewhere safe. That night, I didn't confront mom. Instead, I went back the next day and withdrew every penny except $1, opened a new account at Community Credit Union across town that only I could access. For three days, I acted completely normal, went to work, came home, did chemistry homework, watch Netflix with mom like nothing had changed. She had no idea I'd moved my entire life savings. Then Friday night, I heard her giggling on the phone with her friend Linda, planning their weekly book club dinner at that expensive steakhouse downtown. Don't worry about splitting the chat, she laughed. I'll just grab some cash from Jessica's account tomorrow morning. She never checks it anyway. Twenty minutes later, she knocked on my door wearing silk pajamas. Hey, sweetie, I'm running to the ATM before book club. Need anything from CVS? I smiled innocently. No.

It happened last Tuesday around nine PM. I was at my girlfriend Emma's apartment watching Netflix when she randomly got up and went to her bedroom. I thought she was just going to the bathroom or something, but then she came back holding her dad's old hunting rifle. The thing looked ancient but well maintained. Check this out, she said, pointing it directly at my forehead from maybe three feet away. My dad taught me how to use this when I was 12. I literally froze. Like, completely stopped breathing for a second. The barrel was staring me right in the face, and all I could think was how massive it looked from that angle. My heart started pounding so hard I could hear it in my ears. Emma, what the hell are you doing? I managed to say, trying not to move. She laughed like it was the funniest thing ever. Relax, it's not loaded. See? She pulled the trigger and nothing happened except for a loud click. But hearing that click while looking down the barrel made my stomach drop into my shoes. Are you insane? You never point a gun at someone, loaded or not. I was practically yelling at this point. She rolled her eyes. God, you're such a baby. It's empty. I checked. My dad always kept the ammo locked up separately anyway. But here's the thing. I grew up around guns, too. My uncle took me Hunting every fall since I was 10, and the first rule he drilled into my head was, you never, ever point a firearm at anything you don't intend to destroy. Look, loaded or unloaded? Doesn't matter. It's like gun safety 1:01. Emma, this isn't a joke. That's literally the most dangerous thing you can do with a gun. I said, standing up slowly with my hands visible. Even if you think it's empty. She was still holding it casually, like it was a toy or something. You're being dramatic. I've handled this gun a million times. That's when I decided to prove my point. I asked her to hand me the rifle, and she did. Still thinking I was overreacting, I pointed it toward the ground. And. Work.

My mom kept borrowing money from my savings account without asking. Started small when I was 15. 20 here, 50 there. Always promised, I'll pay you back next week, sweetheart. I was saving for my first car, working weekends at Scoops Ice Cream downtown. The job absolutely sucked. Sticky floors covered in melted ice cream, screaming kids having sugar meltdowns, and my chain smoking manager, Derek, who reeked of cigarettes. After two grueling years of scooping rocky road and mopping chocolate spills every night, I'd saved almost $3,000. Then I checked my balance at the ATM. 8 47 30 two. My heart stopped. I drove straight home, found mom making fancy curried coffee with expensive pods she claimed we couldn't afford. Mom, where's my money? She didn't look. Oh, honey, I needed it for groceries. Things are tight since the divorce. You'll get it back. But groceries don't cost $2,000. I started watching her spending. New coach purse from the outlet mall, weekly salon appointments for highlights, fancy dinners with club friends every Friday. All while telling me we had to tighten our belts and couldn't afford name brand cereal I liked. I felt sick. This was my money from my job. Dealing with brain freeze headaches in that walk in freezer every single night. When I confronted her again, she got defensive. I'm your mother, Jessica. I've spent way more than 3,000 raising you over 17 years. Consider this paying me Back for all those diapers and formula. That comment made my blood boil. That's when I knew I had to be smart about this. During lunch break, I went to First National Bank and asked to speak with someone about my account. To tell her. Margaret pulled up my statements, her face changing as she scrolled through months of transactions. Your mom's been withdrawing money almost weekly for six months, he whispered. Since you're a minor, this is technically a joint account, so it's legal. But you can open your own when you turn 18 next month. She leaned closer. Until then, you could withdraw everything and keep it somewhere safe. That night, I didn't confront mom. Instead, I went back the next day and withdrew every penny except $1, opened a new account at Community Credit Union across town that only I could access. For three days, I acted completely normal. Went to work, came home, did chemistry homework, watch Netflix with mom like nothing had changed. She had no idea I'd moved my entire life savings. Then Friday night, I heard her giggling on the phone with her friend Linda, planning their weekly book club dinner at that expensive steakhouse downtown. Don't worry about splitting the check, she laughed. I'll just grab some cash from Jessica's account tomorrow morning. She never checks it anyway. Twenty minutes later, she knocked on my door wearing silk pajamas. Hey, sweetie, I'm running to the ATM before book club. Need anything from CVS. I smiled innocently. No

Hey, you should probably start working on finding my replacement for tomorrow. What do you mean? You're scheduled to come in tomorrow. Not anymore. I just sent you an email to make it my day off.

Emma had been best friends with Zoe since second grade. They did everything together. Walked to school, ate lunch at the same table, had sleepovers every weekend. My daughter would come home with stories about their inside jokes and secret handshakes. They were inseparable. But everything changed when Zoe got an iPhone 15 for her 13th birthday. Suddenly, Emma wasn't getting invited to hang out anymore. At lunch, Zoe would sit with the girls who had fancy phones, showing off her new camera and playing games. Emma couldn't join because she only had my old flip phone. I came home in tears three days straight. Mom, Zoe won't even look at me. She said I'm boring now because I can't text her or be in the group chat. It broke my heart watching my confident daughter shrink into herself. I worked two jobs just to keep us afloat after the divorce. There was no way I could afford a six hundred dollar phone for a 13 year old. But seeing Emma's face every day, knowing she was eating lunch alone while her former best friend posted Instagram stories with new friends, made me desperate. That's when I remembered something my grandmother taught me about friendship. She used to say, real friends don't need expensive things to connect. They need shared experiences and genuine care. For each other. I had an idea. Instead of trying to compete with technology, I would give Emma something Zoe's iPhone couldn't. Real adventure. I started planning surprise activities for Emma and whoever wanted to join. Many road trips to the beach, camping in our backyard, teaching her to bake my grandmother's secret cookie recipe. The first weekend, only Emma and I went hiking. But she seemed happier than she'd been in weeks. Taking photos with my old digital camera and collecting pretty rocks. She posted one blurry photo on her rarely used social media with the caption, adventures with Mom. Monday at school, three different girls asked Emma about her weekend. Turns out, while everyone else was stuck inside on their phones, Emma had stories to tell. Real stories about getting lost on the trail and finding a hidden waterfall. Within two weeks, Emma had new friends asking to join our weekend adventures. Girls who were tired of just staring at screens wanted to come camping, learn to bake, go on photo walks around town. The turning point came during our third weekend camping trip. We had four girls with us, roasting marshmallows and telling ghost stories. That's when Zoe showed up at our campsite with her mom. Emma's mom said we could stop by. Zoe said quietly, looking around at the fire. Intense. My mom thought it looked fun when she saw your photos. For a moment, nobody said anything. Then Emma smiled and handed Zoe a marshmallow.

So this middle aged dude named Tom comes in for routine knee surgery. Nothing fancy, just cleaning up some torn cartilage. He seemed pretty normal during pre op, just nervous like everyone else. Kept asking if we had any snacks because he'd been fasting since midnight. We told him the usual stuff about no eating before surgery, and he nodded along. The anesthesiologist starts his countdown, telling Tom to relax and count backwards from 10. Tom gets to about seven, when suddenly he sits bolt upright and shouts, don't touch the snack drawer! It's cursed! Everyone in the OR just froze. Doctor Williams, our anesthesiologist, looked confused. The surgeon stopped prepping. I mean, what do you even say to that? We thought maybe he was having some kind of panic attack or weird reaction to the meds, but Tom was already out, completely unconscious, breathing steady. Figured it was just random nonsense. You know, people say weird stuff when they're going under. So we continued with prep, positioning his leg, getting the instruments ready. About five minutes in, I lean over to grab some gauze from the bedside cabinet. That's when I accidentally knocked into this whole stack of snack packets sitting on the shelf. Chips, granola bars, those little cookies from the vending machine, candy bars, all of it went flying. It was like an explosion of junk food hitting the floor, bouncing everywhere, making this huge Mess. Tom's eyes snap open for just a second, still completely loopy, and he whispers, see? I told you it was cursed. Then his head drops back down. The entire surgical team just lost it. We're all trying not to laugh too loud while picking up Cheetos and Kit Kats off the sterile floor. Even Doctor Williams was cracking up behind his mask. But that was just the beginning. For the next 20 minutes, Tom kept mumbling these incredibly detailed warnings about everything in the room. He told us the stapler was plotting against the clipboard because it was jealous of how much paper it got to hold. The blood pressure cuff was apparently an undercover spy working for the hospital administration to steal our lunch money. The fourth bag kept smile smiling at the ceiling because it knew secrets about the night shift that we didn't want to hear. Every time one of us tried to reassure him that everything was fine, he'd contradict us with some new revelation. He insisted the surgical mask had a hidden agenda to steal pens from our pockets when we weren't looking. The heart monitor was supposedly gossiping about other patients in different rooms. The oxygen tank was planning a retirement party, but didn't want to invite the wheelchair because it had trust issues. At one point, Tom looked directly at Doctor Williams and said very seriously, your beard is whispering to the surgical lights about your weekend plans. You might want to Have a talk with it about privacy. Doctor Williams doesn't even have a beard. He's completely clean shaven. But Tom was so convinced, he kept giving him advice about beard maintenance and grooming products. The funniest part was when he started narrating what he thought. We were all thinking he'd point

So I changed the locks, canceled every privilege in my name, and told their father pick up was tonight. No one argued. I'm Tom, 35, and I've been married to Lisa for 18 months. She has two kids from her first marriage. Marcus, 17, and Sophia, 15. Their biological father lives about 40 minutes away and sees them maybe twice a month when he feels like showing up. When Lisa and I got together, I genuinely wanted to be the stepdad I never had growing up. My own father walked out when I was 12, so I knew what it felt like to need a father figure. I thought being a good stepdad meant being the yes man. Always supportive, always generous, always understanding. New school clothes? Sure, no problem. Concert tickets for Sophia's favorite band? Of course. When Marcus wanted the latest gaming setup, I dropped 800 dollars without blinking. When he crashed my car last month after staying out past curfew, I didn't even make him pay the 500 dollar deductible. But respect, that was a completely different story. It started with small things. You're not our real dad became their go to response whenever I asked them to do basic household tasks. When I'd ask Marcus to take out the trash, he'd say, I only listen to actual parents. When Sophia left dishes piled in the sink for days, she'd shrug and say, my mom didn't tell Me to clean them. Lisa would have talks with them about respect. They'd apologize and behave for maybe a week. Then we'd be right back to the same pattern. The breaking point came Last Friday. I decided to leave work early to surprise Lisa with dinner plans for our anniversary weekend. I pulled into the driveway around three in the afternoon and immediately knew something was wrong. There were cars I didn't recognize parked on our street, and I could hear music blasting from inside the house. I walked through my front door to find about 20 teenagers having a full blown party in my living room. Red solo cups everywhere, the coffee table pushed against the wall. Kids I'd never seen before eating food from my kitchen. My house was completely trashed. Broken lamp, mysterious stains on my white couch, and the bottle scattered everywhere. Marcus was in the center of it all, acting like the king of the castle. When he saw me, he didn't even look embarrassed, just annoyed that I'd shown up. Party's over, I said loudly. Everyone out now! The music stopped. Kids started grabbing their stuff and heading for the door, but Marcus didn't move. Clean this mess up immediately, I told him once the house was empty. He actually laughed. You can't tell me what to do! You're not my father! This is my house! Marcus! My couch that's ruined! My lamp that's broken! No, Sophia interrupted, appearing from the kitchen. It's Mom's. House, too. We live here. We only take orders from real family, not from some guy mom married. That's when I noticed something that made my blood run cold. The door to my home office was wide open, and I always kept it locked. I walked over and immediately saw that my safe was open. My emergency cash envelope, the one where I've been saving money for Lisa's surprise birthday trip to Hawaii, was completely empty. 2000

So you remember, you're not part of this family. While dad laughed hysterically. I'm 29. Always been the odd one out in the Peterson family. Different hair, different build, different everything. They joke about the mailman constantly. So when Sarah handed me that DNA kit with a smirk, in time to prove what we all know, I wasn't even surprised. Dad was cracking up, mom nodding like she'd been waiting years for this moment. Fine, I said, but let's make it interesting. How about we all take DNA tests? You know, for science. The room went quiet. Sarah laughed nervously. Why would we need to? Because I already took one six months ago, I said, pulling out my phone. And according to 23 and me, I have a half sister named Jessica. Been looking for her biological family. I showed them Jessica's profile. Same last name as Mom's Maiden name. Same distinctive birthmark mom has on her wrist. Jessica was born 9 months after Mom's business trip to Chicago in 1995. Remember that trip, mom? The one where you couldn't be reached for three days? Mom's face went white. Dad stopped laughing immediately. Oh, it gets better. I continued scrolling through my phone. Jessica wasn't the only surprise. I have three half siblings from Mom's various work conferences. I showed them photos. This is Michael from Denver, born in 1998. Ring any bells about that marketing seminar you attended? Alone. Sarah grabbed the phone. That's not possible. And here's little Emma from Portland. Born in 2,001. Funny how she has the same rare eye condition as Mom. Dad's face was turned red, but not from laughter anymore. Linda, what the hell is this? The best part. I pulled out a thick envelope from my jacket. I've been in contact with all three of them for months. They all want to meet their biological mother. In fact, they're driving here right now. Mom stood up shakily. You didn't. I did. Jessica should be here in about an hour. Michael's flying in from Denver tonight. Emma's parents are bringing her tomorrow morning for Christmas brunch. I looked at Sarah, who was still holding the DNA kit. So tell me again about not being part of this family. Because it looks like you're about to have a lot more family than you bargained for. Dad was staring at mom like he'd never seen her before. 26 years, Linda. Twenty six years of marriage, and you've been lying about three children. Actually, I said, checking my messages. Make that four. Just got a DNA match notification this morning. Apparently, there's a David from Miami who's also looking for answers. The doorbell rang. Through the window, I could see a young woman with mom's exact nose and chin standing on our porch holding a wrapped present. That'll be Jessica, I said, walking toward the door. I told her we were having a family reunion. Sarah finally found her voice. You planned this whole thing. You gave me six months to prepare. After I took that DNA test, I shrugged. Did you really think I'd just sit on information this explosive? I opened the door. Jessica, come in. Meet your biological family. Jessica walked in looking exactly like mom did in old photos. Hi, everyone.

I couldn't believe what I was hearing. After being homeless for two years, sleeping in parking lots, showering at truck stops, I finally saved enough to buy my own place. A small three bedroom house. Nothing fancy, but it was mine. The irony wasn't lost on me when I was homeless, begging them to let me park my camper in their driveway for just a few weeks. They called it an eye sore and told me to figure it out myself. My brother Dan actually laughed, calling me a homeless bum while his wife took pictures to mock me on social media. Now here they were, all four of them plus Dan's pregnant wife, going up at my door unannounced. They didn't even have my address. I never gave it to them. They must have followed me from work or something. Equally creepy. The moment I opened the door, they pushed past me like they owned the place. Dan's wife immediately started taking pictures again, but this time with dollar signs in her eyes. My parents were walking through my house like real estate agents, pointing at rooms, measuring spaces with their eyes, discussing which kid would get which bedroom. This is way too much space for just you, my mom declared, running her fingers along my kitchen. Counters. It's wasteful. My dad was already outside circling my property. Good luck. Size close to Dan's work, too. This will save us money on gas. That's when Dan pulled me aside into what used to be my peaceful living room. His wife and kids had already made themselves comfortable on my couch, feet up on my coffee table, tracking MUD across my carpet. Look, this is simple, Dan said, not even looking me in the eye. You don't need all this space. We're moving in next weekend. Can live in that camper out back. No discussion, no asking, no would you consider, or we'd really appreciate just informing me like I was a tenant getting evicted. The kids need stability, he continued. Olivia's pregnant again. We can't keep cramming everyone into mom and dad's place. I actually laughed. Absolutely not. That's when my mom marched back in from inspecting in my bedrooms. Daniel has four kids and another on the way. You're being selfish, living in all this space alone. My dad nodded from the doorway. It's time you helped family instead of just thinking about yourself. We raised you better than this. The audacity was breathtaking. These were the same people who wouldn't let me park in their driveway when I was literally homeless. Now they wanted to kick me out of my own house. I pulled out my phone and started recording. Let me get this straight. Do you want me to give up the house? I Bought with my own money. That I'm paying the mortgage on. So you can live here for free? We're not asking, Dan said, stepping closer like he was trying to intimidate me. We're telling you, family comes first. You owe us. After everything we've done for you. Everything you've done for me? I almost choked. You literally called me a homeless bum and refused to help when I was living in my truck. That was different. My mom snapped. You were irresponsible back then. Now you need to step up and do the right thing. Dan's wife finally spoke up. From my

So I made sure everyone knew the truth. My son Ethan had been working on this piano piece for months. Every night after dinner, he'd sit at our crappy secondhand keyboard that I got from some garage sale for $50 and play this melody he wrote. He called it sky falling because he said it sounded like what falling from the sky would feel like. The kid was 10, but he had this ear for music that honestly blew my mind. He'd written the whole thing out by hand on music paper, every note perfectly placed. His handwriting was messy as hell, but the music was beautiful. Haunting, even. He recorded himself playing it on my phone, like 15 times until he got a version he was happy with. Then he submitted it for his school music project. Ethan was so proud of that song, he'd play it for anyone who'd listen. Our neighbours probably knew it by heart at that point. When he told me he was going to perform it at the spring recital, I marked my calendar and took the afternoon off work. Day of the recital came and I was sitting in the school auditorium with all the other parents. I looked at the program and saw Ethan listed as a backup performer. That was weird because he'd been practicing for weeks, but whatever. Maybe they had too many kids who wanted to Perform. Then the lights dimmed and this kid named Ryan walked onto the stage. He sat down at the piano and started playing. The first few notes hit me like a punch to the gut. It was sky falling. Ethan song. Note for note, exactly the same. I looked over at Ethan sitting with his class. His face went from confusion to this crushed expression that made my chest tight. He knew his song when he heard it, and he couldn't understand why someone else was playing it. Ryan finished and everyone clapped. The teacher, Mister Davies, walked to the microphone and said, that was a beautiful original composition by Ryan titled Sky Falling. Original Composition. My blood started boiling. After the recital ended, I found Mister Davies by the piano. Excuse me, I said, trying to keep my voice calm. My son Ethan wrote that song. Why was Ryan performing it? Mister Davies smiled this awkward, dismissive smile. Oh, Ethan's version needed too much polish. I gave it to Ryan because he's more technically advanced. Same idea, just cleaner execution. I stared at him. You used my kid's original composition without giving him credit? He shrugged like it was no big deal. It's for the school, not a competition. It's really not that deep. Not that deep? This man just told me stealing my son's work wasn't that deep. That night, I didn't sleep. Instead, I gathered everything. Ethan's original handwritten sheet music with the date from three months Ago, the recordings on my phone with time stamps. The email he'd sent to Mister Davies submitting the

My brother William has always been the favorite. When we were kids, he broke my Nintendo, and somehow I got grounded for not putting it away safely when he failed math. It's because I didn't help him study enough. When he stole $20 from my birthday money, my parents said I shouldn't have left it where he could see it. The pattern never changed. William would mess up, and somehow it became my responsibility to fix it or prevent it from happening again. Last month, I finally saved enough from my restaurant job to buy a used pickup truck. I've been working doubles every weekend for 8 months, skipping hanging out with friends, eating ramen for dinner most nights. Nothing fancy, a 2009 Ford with 150 k miles and a few rust spots. But it was mine. The first thing that was actually legally completely mine. William immediately started asking to borrow it. Come on, bro, just for one night. I need to pick up this girl I'm talking to. I always said no, because he'd already crashed two of Dad's cars and somehow never faced any real consequences. Dad just kept buying him new ones while lecturing me about responsibility. The begging turned into guilt trips. You're being selfish became a daily phrase from my parents. Family shares with family. But I Held firm. That truck represented eight months of sacrifice, and I wasn't about to watch William destroy it like everything else. Friday night, I went to see a movie with my coworker, Megan. We've been planning it for weeks. First time I'd spent money on entertainment in months. When I came out of the theater around 11 p m, my truck was gone from the parking lot. I immediately knew it was William. I called him straight to voicemail, called my parents. They claimed they had no idea where he was and suggested maybe I'd parked somewhere else. Right, because I'd forget where I parked the truck I'd saved eight months to buy. I spent two hours walking around nearby streets, thinking maybe he just moved it as some stupid prank. Megan offered to drive me home, but I was too angry to think straight. Around 2 a m, I got a call from Mercy General Hospital. We have a William Walker here who was in an accident. He listed you as an emergency contact. My heart dropped. Despite everything, he was still my brother. I rushed to the hospital, expecting the worst. William was sitting up in bed with a few cuts and bruises, flirting with a nurse and acting like nothing happened. Oh, hey, bro. Funny story. That's when the doctor told me what really happened. William had been drag racing on Creek Road, the winding back road where three kids died last year doing the exact same Thing. He'd wrapped my truck around an oak tree, going at least 60 miles per hour. My truck was completely totaled. Eight months of work gone. But here's the part that broke me.

Dad left me at Grandpa's house when I was 11 because his new wife didn't want me around. I thought it was the worst thing ever. But Grandpa taught me everything about farming and business. Grandpa wasn't just some old farmer. He owned 500 acres of prime agricultural land worth millions. When dad was growing up, Grandpa was an alcoholic who barely kept the farm running. But by the time I arrived, he'd gotten sober and turned everything around. For seven years, it was just me and Grandpa. He taught me how to work cattle, manage crops, handle finances and run a business. We'd wake up at 5:00am every day, work until sunset, then he'd help me with homework. He never missed a single school event. When he died, he left me everything. Not just the land, the house, the equipment, the bank accounts, everything. I was 18 and suddenly owned more than most people see in a lifetime. Dad didn't even come to the funeral. Didn't call to check on me. Nothing. I spent the next 15 years building Grandpa's legacy. I turned the ranch into a successful agritourism operation. City families come stay for weeks, learning farm life. I also run a farmers market, sell organic beef and lease land to other farmers. Last year I cleared 800,000 dollar profit. Dad never Called once in 15 years. Not on my birthday, not on holidays, nothing. I sent him a graduation invitation when I finished my agriculture degree. He didn't show. When I got married three years ago, I didn't even bother inviting him. Then last week, out of nowhere, dad shows up at my door. Not to apologize, not to reconnect. He wanted to talk business. Turns out his precious daughter, my half sister, who I've met exactly twice, is struggling financially. Her husband lost his job, they're behind on their mortgage and she needs a fresh start. Dad figured I could just hand over some land and give her a management position. Family sticks together, he says with a straight face. The audacity was unbelievable. This man who abandoned his eleven year old son was lecturing me about family loyalty. I told him I'd think about it, hoping he'd get the hint and leave. Instead, he started texting me multiple times, daily. Detailed messages about which parcels of land would be perfect for his daughter. Suggestions about what roles she could fill in my business. Even ideas about where she and her husband could build a house. The messages got more demanding each day. She deserves this opportunity. Grandpa would have wanted this. You owe the family. It was like he thought my property was some kind of family commune he could just redistribute. After a week of constant harassment, I'd had enough. I called my friend Samuel, who's a local Police officer and asked him how to get a trespass order. Thirty minutes later, I walked out of the station with legal paperwork in hand. Then I asked another close friend, Peter, to take a road trip with me. I need backup for a family reunion. I told him. He didn't ask questions, just grabbed his keys. It took us 10 hours to drive to Dad's house. I needed that time to clear my head and plan exactly what I was going to say. Peter kept offering to drive, but I needed something to do with my hands while I processed everything. We pulled up to Dad's mom

But did she forget I still own the house? I'm a 35 year old electrician who's been working construction since I was 18. Built up a decent savings, bought my house when I was 28. A nice three bedroom ranch with a big backyard and a two car garage. Nothing fancy, but it was mine. Paid for with my own sweat and overtime hours. Two years ago, I married Amanda, who seemed responsible and down to earth as a mental hygienist. I kept the house in my name to protect my assets. After seeing my brother's messy divorce about six months ago, things changed. Amanda became critical of everything, started spending more time at the gym, bought new clothes, and often had late yoga classes. I wasn't born yesterday. The signs were all there, but I figured I'd let it play out and see what she was really up to. Last Tuesday, while working downtown, I got a text from Amanda. I'm done with this marriage. Change the locks. Brad's moving in this weekend. My lawyer will contact you about dividing assets. Add her personal trainer from the fancy gym across town. The pieces clicked into place immediately. I'm standing there in my work boots, tool belt around my waist, reading this message twice to make sure I understood it correctly. This woman really thought she could just me out of my own house and move her Boyfriend in like, some kind of real estate hostile takeover. My coworker Mike saw my face and asked what was wrong. I showed him the text, and he just started laughing. Dude, she knows you actually own that place, right? That's when it hit me. Amanda had always acted like we owned the house together, but she'd never seen the deed, never been involved in property taxes, never dealt with homeowners insurance. In her mind, marriage automatically meant shared ownership of everything. I called my buddy Steve, who's a real estate agent. Steve, remember how you said my house would sell fast in this market? How fast are we talking, Mark? With the location and condition, I could have buyers lined up by tomorrow. If you're serious. Dead serious. I need a cash buyer who can close in two weeks, max. What's the rush? Let's just say I'm dealing with some unwanted house guests. By Wednesday morning, Steve had three cash offers above asking price. I picked the highest one with the fastest closing date, exactly 12 days away. Thursday morning, I drove by the house to see Brad's lifted truck in my driveway, his motorcycle in my garage. The audacity was breathtaking. This guy was already making himself at home, probably thinking he'd hit the Jackpot with his new living situation. I parked across the street and called Amanda. She answered on the first ring, probably expecting me to beg to come home. Amanda, I hope you and Brad Are comfortable because you've got 11 days to enjoy the place. What are you talking about? I sold the house. Cash buyer closing next Friday. You'll need to be out by then. The silence stretched so long, I thought the call had dropped. Then she exploded. You can't sell our house without my permission. I'll sue you. Brad gave up his apartment lease. Actually, I can sell my house whenever I want. It's called property ownership. Maybe Brad should have checked the deed before giving up his lease. This is insane. Where are we supposed to go? Amanda, that became not my problem the second you changed my locks.

My cousin Rachel just buried her husband and two kids last week. Car accident took them all at once. She's left with just her five year old daughter, Emma. And honestly, watching them at the funeral was the most heartbreaking thing I've ever seen in my life. So my brother Jake and his wife Kelly show up to our house that morning. Before we head to the church, first thing Kelly does is announce she's pregnant. We're all getting ready for a funeral, and she's like, guess what, everyone, we have news. My mom congratulated her, but told her to keep it quiet for today out of respect. Did Kelly listen? Of course not. The second we get to the church, Kelly starts making these loud gagging noises and rubbing her completely flat stomach. Every time someone looked at her, she'd go, oh, sorry, morning sickness, I'm pregnant. You know, she kept saying stuff like, as a mom, I just can't imagine what Rachel's going through, which was ridiculous because Kelly doesn't have any kids yet. At the cemetery, she literally asked Rachel's sister to give up her seat so the pregnant lady could rest her feet. She'd been standing for like 10 minutes total. I was getting so annoyed, but I kept my mouth shut because it's a funeral. After the service, we went back to my aunt's house. Kelly kept making everything about herself. Someone would Mention how hard this must be for Rachel. And Kelly would jump in with, oh, I know. Now that I'm pregnant, I understand maternal instincts so much better. When people were talking about the babies who died, Kelly would rub her stomach and talk about how excited she was to be a mom. The bathroom thing was what really got me. Every time Kelly needed to use the bathroom, she'd announce, pregnant lady coming through or, baby on board needs to pee there. We're like 30 people there grieving, and she's treating it like her personal pregnancy announcement party. But then she crossed the line. Rachel was sitting quietly in the corner with Emma, both of them just completely destroyed. Kelly walks right up to them, sticks out her flat belly, and says, me and Jake just found out I'm pregnant. And honestly, we're beside ourselves thinking about how something like this could happen to us, too. Rachel completely broke down, started sobbing so hard she could barely breathe. Emma got scared and started crying, too. Everyone in the room just stopped and stared. That's when I lost it. I stood up and said, loud enough for everyone to hear, Kelly, no one gives a damn that you're pregnant. Look around you. This is a funeral for two babies and their father. You took that pregnancy test four days ago, and you're acting like you're the first woman to ever get pregnant. Just leave. Kelly started crying and ran out. Jake followed her, but not before calling me a fat, bitter witch in front of everyone. My aunt had to comfort Rachel while my mom took Emma outside. My phone's been blowing up all day with calls from Jake and Kelly's family calling me every name in the book. They're saying I made a pregnant woman cry and I'm heartless. Jake texted me that Kelly's so upset.

My daughter Emma and her cousin Kayla were born like two weeks apart, so my wife decided they had to be best friends. Problem is, Emma can't stand Kayla. Never could. But my wife keeps pushing it. She makes Emma hang out with Kayla at every family thing. She invites Kayla on our vacations. She even makes Emma call her just to chat it. It's honestly ridiculous. I keep telling my wife to drop it, but she won't listen. So yesterday, my wife forces Emma to video call Kayla again. Emma said no, and my wife goes, unless you have a valid reason for disliking your cousin, you're doing this because we're family. Emma rolled her eyes and did the call. This morning I wake up and Emma's sitting at the kitchen table with her laptop open, grinning like she just won the lottery. She goes, dad, wanna see something? And turns the screen toward me. It's a full Powerpoint presentation titled Valid Reasons to Dislike Kayla, and I'm talking professional level stuff here. He had screenshots from their video call last night. Charts, everything.

Next slide was a case study, conversations that provide no value, where she timed how long Kayla spent talking about her nail polish collection. 14 minutes. 14 whole minutes about sparkly pink versus regular pink. Then came rethinking the idea that there are no dumb questions with a compilation of Kayla asking things like wait, is Canada a state? And do fish get thirsty? I nearly spit out my coffee at that one. She had graphs showing Kayla's use of the word like compared to actual meaningful words. The ratio was honestly disturbing.

Emma had been best friends with Zoe since second grade. They did everything together. Walked to school, ate lunch at the same table, had sleepovers every weekend. My daughter would come home with stories about their inside jokes and secret handshakes. They were inseparable. But everything changed when Zoe got an iPhone 15 for her 13th birthday. Suddenly, Emma wasn't getting invited to hang out anymore. At lunch, Zoe would sit with the girls who had fancy phones, showing off her new camera and playing games. Emma couldn't join because she only had my old flip phone. I came home in tears three days straight. Mom, Zoe won't even look at me. She said I'm boring now because I can't text her or be in the group chat. It broke my heart watching my confident daughter shrink into herself. I worked two jobs just to keep us afloat after the divorce. There was no way I could afford a six hundred dollar phone for a 13 year old. But seeing Emma's face every day, knowing she was eating lunch alone while her former best friend posted Instagram stories with new friends, made me desperate. That's when I remembered something my grandmother taught me about friendship. She used to say, real friends don't need expensive things to connect. They need shared experiences and genuine care. For each other. I had an idea. Instead of trying to compete with technology, I would give Emma something Zoe's iPhone couldn't. Real adventure. I started planning surprise activities for Emma and whoever wanted to join. Many road trips to the beach, camping in our backyard, teaching her to bake my grandmother's secret cookie recipe. The first weekend, only Emma and I went hiking. But she seemed happier than she'd been in weeks. Taking photos with my old digital camera and collecting pretty rocks. She posted one blurry photo on her rarely used social media with the caption, adventures with Mom. Monday at school, three different girls asked Emma about her weekend. Turns out, while everyone else was stuck inside on their phones, Emma had stories to tell. Real stories about getting lost on the trail and finding a hidden waterfall. Within two weeks, Emma had new friends asking to join our weekend adventures. Girls who were tired of just staring at screens wanted to come camping, learn to bake, go on photo walks around town. The turning point came during our third weekend camping trip. We had four girls with us, roasting marshmallows and telling ghost stories. That's when Zoe showed up at our campsite with her mom. Emma's mom said we could stop by. Zoe said quietly, looking around at the fire. Intense. My mom thought it looked fun when she saw your photos. For a moment, nobody said anything. Then Emma smiled and handed Zoe a Mark.

Suddenly, she demanded a divorce, saying, you're useless to me now. I replied, don't regret this later, lol. The funeral was Tuesday. By Friday, she was already shopping for a mansion in Beverly Hills. I don't need you anymore, she said, tossing divorce papers on our kitchen table next to my unemployment check. I'm finally free from dead weight. I just smiled and signed them without reading. She thought I was an idiot who'd given up. But here's what she didn't know. I've been having secret conversations with her father for months before he died. He'd called me one evening, voice shaking with disappointment. Son, I need to tell you something about Kimberly. She's been pressuring me to change my will. She wants me to cut out her brother and sister completely. Says they don't deserve anything because they abandoned me. That wasn't true. Her siblings lived across the country but called him daily. Kimberly barely visited unless she needed money. There's more he can continued. I caught her going through my financial documents last week. She was photographing my bank statements and investment portfolios. When I confronted her, she said she was just helping me organize. That's when he told me his plan. The will Kimberly knew about it was fake. He'd shown it to her on purpose to test her character. The real will was locked in a different lawyer's safe. Two weeks after the funeral, we're at What she thinks is the final divorce meeting. She struts in wearing a five thousand dollar Chanel dress and diamond earrings. That cost more than my car. She's already bragging about her new Porsche in the mansion she put a deposit on. This is so exciting, she tells the lawyer. I can finally live the life I deserve. No more supporting a jobless husband who brings nothing to the table. The inheritance lawyer walks in with a thick leather folder. I recognize him immediately. It's Martin Lee, her father's real attorney, not the junior associate who'd been handling the official proceedings. Missus, Benjamin, Son. I'm afraid there's been a significant misunderstanding, he says calmly. Smile falters slightly. What kind of misunderstanding? The will was clear. I inherited everything. He opens the folder and slides a document across the mahogany table. This is your father's actual will, executed just three months before his death. The document you've been referencing was, let's call it a preliminary draft. She grabs the papers, her manicured nails clicking against the desk. What are you talking about? This can't be right. Martin points to the highlighted section. Your father was quite specific. He left the entire estate to your husband, Benjamin here with explicit instructions that you receive nothing if you initiated divorce proceedings within two years of his death. The color drains from her face. That's impossible. He wouldn't do that to me, actually, Martin continues. He included a personal letter explaining his decision. Would You like me to read it? She nods weakly. Her earlier confidence completely evaporated. Martin clears his throat. Kimberly, if you're hearing this, it means you chose money over family. I watched you manipulate and scheme.

Get out. I said nothing. Their faces turned pale when the notary revealed the truth. See, my stepmom Cynthia and her twin daughters, Brittany and Ashley had moved in when I was 12. Dad always treated them like princesses while I got hand me downs and endless chores. Blood isn't everything, Chloe, he'd say, whenever I complained about the obvious favoritism. The twins got new cars at 6 teen. I got a lecture about being grateful. They got college funds. I got told to figure it out yourself. By the time I turned 18, it was clear I wasn't welcome anymore. College isn't for everyone, sweetie, Cynthia cooed, flashing that fake smile. Maybe try community college. There's a nice apartment complex downtown that takes monthly renters. So I left. I worked two jobs, diner waitress by day, hotel cleaner by night, and clawed my way through nursing school. Six years of exhaustion, but I graduated with honors. I barely visited home. Every holiday invitation felt more like pity than family. Still, I built my own life, a job at the regional hospital, a small starter house, even a steady relationship with a fellow nurse named Thomas. Life finally felt stable. Then last year, dad was diagnosed with early onset dementia. Suddenly, my phone lit up non stop. We need help with Dad, Cynthia begged one late night. You're the nurse in the family. You understand this medical stuff. When I came back the site, it broke me. Dad barely recognized me. The house was filthy, his meds unorganized, while the twins partied by the pool and charged spa trips to his cards. He looked scared like a child left alone. When I suggested professional caregivers, Cynthia's mask slipped. We're family, Chloe. We can handle our own. Besides, do you know how expensive those people are? They couldn't handle anything. On my next visit, I found dad wandering outside in his pajamas at 3:00am. Neighbors had called the cops. Inside, the air stank from his accidents. No one cleaned up. Britney live streamed makeup tutorials while Ashley planned her next shopping spree. This is neglect, I told Cynthia. Her eyes narrowed. Don't you dare lecture us. Where were you the past 10 years? Now you swoop in like you're better than us. That night, I made a decision. I quit my job, broke up with Thomas and moved back home. For eight months, I became Dad's full time caregiver. Every morning I bathed him, dressed him and fed him. I kept his meds straight, comforted him during episodes and listened when he had lucid moments. He'd tell me stories about mom who passed away when I was little. I'm sorry, sweetheart, he whispered one afternoon, his eyes finally clear. I wasn't fair to you. Cynthia convinced me treating everyone equally meant giving them more because they weren't really Mine, but you were always my real daughter. The twins hated me for it. They wind I was too controlling and making them look bad, all while draining his savings on vacation. When I confronted Brittany, she just smirked. Dad wanted us to be happy. He's not going to live forever, so we might as well enjoy it now. His decline was brutal. I stayed up nights holding his hand. Cynthia.

I slammed on the brakes and jumped out of my car. Nora, baby, what are you doing out here? She was shivering violently. And just her school clothes, no coat. Tears frozen on her little cheeks. Daddy locked me out. He said, I can't come back until you get home from work. My heart dropped. It was 9 p m. On a Friday. Jonathan knew I always worked late on Fridays. This wasn't an accident. How long have you been out here? Since you left this morning, she whispered. I scooped her up, feeling how ice cold her little body was, and carried her toward our front door. It was locked. I used my key. Fury building with every step. I found Jonathan exactly where I expected. Sprawled on the couch in his boxers and T-shirt, controller in hand, playing call of duty. The heat was cranked up to 75 degrees. Empty beer cans littered the coffee table. Why was our daughter outside for 12 hours? I tried to keep my voice calm. He didn't even pause his game. She spilled grape juice on my new controller this morning, I told her. Actions have consequences. I stared at him in disbelief. She's 6 years old, Jonathan. She spilled juice accidentally and you left her outside to freeze? Maybe next time she'll be more careful around my stuff. That's when I noticed Nora's pink backpack sitting by the front door. It was stuffed full, bulging at the seams. Her favorite stuffed bunny was sticking out the top. What's this? I pointed at the bag. Jonathan finally paused his game and turned to look at me. There was something cold in his eyes I'd never, ever seen before. I've been doing a lot of thinking today. While she was outside, he said slowly, this whole family thing isn't working out for me. Nor is too much work, too expensive, too loud. And honestly, I never wanted kids in the first place. The room started spinning. What are you talking about? I'm talking about you taking her and leaving. Night. I already had the locks changed while you were at work. You just got lucky I hadn't switched them out yet. I felt like I was in a nightmare. You're abandoning your own daughter? Nora was still clinging to me, her wet clothes soaking through my work blazer. She was listening to every word, her big brown eyes darting between us. Here's the thing. Jonathan stood up, stretching like this was all perfectly normal. She's not really mine anyway. I mean, yeah, biologically, whatever. But I never signed up for this dad life. You can have her. The casual cruelty in his voice made me sick. This was the man I've been married to for eight years. The man who used to read Nora bedtime stories. Jonathan, she's your daughter. You can't just watch Me? He picked up his phone. I already talked to my buddy Steven, who's a lawyer, apparently. If I just

Growing up, my sister Kayla made everything about her. My birthday parties. She got gifts, too, because I wouldn't exist without her. Every graduation, every achievement hijacked. When I won the science fair in eighth grade, she convinced my parents to throw her a supportive sister party the same night. When I got into college, she announced her engagement at my Celebration dinner. When I graduated with honors, she showed up in a revealing red dress and spent the whole ceremony flirting with professors. The pattern never stopped. Kayla had this way of making herself the victim whenever I achieved anything. You're so lucky, she'd say. I sacrificed so much for you growing up. Meanwhile, I was the one babysitting her kids while she partied through her 20s. I was the one lending her money she never paid back. I was the one covering for her when she bailed on family obligations. When I got engaged to my Indian fiance, Priya, I was terrified Kayla would find a way to ruin it. Sure enough, at our engagement party, she immediately joked about wearing white to our wedding. It'll be so funny, she laughed. Like in the movies. I'll be the mysterious woman in white. She even made this dramatic pose, hand on her forehead like some soap opera actress. I pulled her aside and told her, absolutely not. This is my one day. Kayla, please. She rolled her eyes and said I was being dramatic, that it was just a joke. God, you're so sensitive. It's not like anyone would actually confuse me for the bride. But she seemed to agree to drop it, too. Weeks later, I found out she'd gone behind my back and asked Priya directly. Your sister seems really excited about her dress choice, Priya mentioned casually over dinner. She kept asking about fabric and styles. My blood ran cold. I knew exactly what that meant. I freaked out on Priya explaining Kayla's entire history of stealing my moments. She did this at my high school graduation. Wore this attention grabbing red dress and flirted with all the dads. At my college graduation, she announced her pregnancy. She'll definitely show up in some elaborate white gown designed to make everyone look at her instead of us. That night, I had a complete breakdown. Sobbing, hyperventilating. 28 years of suppressed resentment came pouring out. I was convinced Priya would see my toxic family dynamics and run for the hills. Who wants to marry into that kind of drama? Instead, she held me and said something genius. You know white isn't the bridal color in Indian weddings, right? I froze. In all my panic about Kayla's manipulation tactics, I completely forgotten that crucial detail. Kayla had no idea Priya would be wearing a stunning red lehanga with intricate gold embroidery. Wedding day arrives. I'm getting ready with my groomsmen when my Cousin texts dude, your sister just walked in looking like she thinks she's the bride. My stomach dropped until I remembered Priya's words. Then I actually started laughing. Kayla struts in wearing this elaborate white ball gown, strapless with a cathedral train, clearly custom made and expensive. She'd even hired a professional makeup artist and had her hair done in an elaborate updo with white flowers. The confused looks from Priya's family were absolutely priceless. Indian weddings are vibrant, colorful celebrations. And here's Kayla looking like.

You can figure it out. She shrugged. I stood there watching her walk away with her perfect little blended family, dragging their matching designer suitcases toward the gate. She didn't even look back. Not once. I had $23 in my pocket, a dead phone charger, and absolutely nowhere to go in this massive airport. That's when I remembered the business card tucked in my wallet. The one with the fancy logo I've been carrying around for three years. My Aunt Sarah's restaurant card. The sister my mom had been bad mouthing my entire life, calling her a jealous failure. Sarah's a pathetic loser, mom always said. She's jealous of our success and stability. Don't believe anything she tells you about our family. But standing there alone in JFK Terminal 4, watching families rush past me with their vacation excitement, I figured I had nothing left to lose. I found a payphone. Yes, they still exist in airports. And dialed the number with shaking fingers. It rang twice before a warm, professional voice answered. Bella Vista Restaurant. This is Sarah speaking. Aunt Sarah, it's Maya. I'm. I'm in really big trouble right now. The silence lasted forever. Then, in a completely different tone. Baby girl? Maya, where are you? Are you safe? What happened? I started crying. Right there in the middle of the busy Terminal. Mom left me at the airport. She took her new husband and his kids on vacation to Hawaii and just abandoned me here. What terminal are you at? I'm coming to get you right now. You don't understand. I'm at JFK in New York. You're all the way in Chicago. I can't ask you to. Maya, Honey, listen to me carefully. I have three successful restaurants now. I'm not the broke failure your mother told you I was. Exactly where you are. I'm getting on the next available flight. Four hours later, I watched a confident woman in designer jeans and a cashmere coat rush through the arrivals gate, scanning the crowd frantically. She looked exactly like mom, but her eyes were kind instead of cold. When she spotted me, she started running. I've been waiting 10 years for this phone call, she whispered, hugging me so tight I could barely breathe. I've tried reaching you so many times, but your mother blocked every single attempt. To ride to her luxury hotel suite was completely surreal. Sarah explained everything while ordering room service. How she built a successful restaurant empire from nothing. How she been sending birthday cards and Christmas gifts that mom apparently threw away unopened. How she'd even hired a family lawyer once to try for visitation rights. Your mother told everyone in our family that I was a drug addict who couldn't hold a job. Sarah laughed bitterly. Meanwhile, I've been featured in Chicago magazine as entrepreneur Of the year, two years running. That night in the hotel, Sarah showed me years worth of returned letters with refused stamps, photos of elaborate birthday cake she'd made for me each year, and bank statements proving she'd been

I couldn't believe what I was hearing. After being homeless for two years, sleeping in parking lots, showering at truck stops, I finally saved enough to buy my own place. A small three bedroom house. Nothing fancy, but it was mine. The irony wasn't lost on me when I was homeless, begging them to let me park my camper in their driveway for just a few weeks. They called it an eyesore and told me to figure it out myself. My brother Dan actually laughed, calling me a homeless bum while his wife took pictures to mock me on social media. Now here they were, all four of them plus Dan's pregnant wife, going up at my door unannounced. They didn't even have my address. I never gave it to them. They must have followed me from work or something. Equally creepy. The moment I opened the door, they pushed past me like they owned the place. Dan's wife immediately started taking pictures again, but this time with dollar signs in her eyes. My parents were walking through my house like real estate agents, pointing at rooms, measuring spaces with their eyes, discussing which kid would get which bedroom. This is way too much space for just you, my mom declared, running her fingers along my kitchen counters. It's wasteful. My dad was already outside circling my property. Good luck. Size close to Dan's work, too. This will save us money on gas. That's when Dan pulled me aside into what used to be my peaceful living room. His wife and kids had already made themselves comfortable on my couch, feet up on my coffee table, tracking MUD across my carpet. Look, this is simple, Dan said, not even looking me in the eye. You don't need all this space. We're moving in next weekend. Can live in that camper out back. No discussion, no asking, no would you consider, or we'd really appreciate just informing me like I was a tenant getting evicted. The kids need stability, he continued. Olivia's pregnant again. We can't keep cramming everyone into mom and dad's place. I actually laughed. Absolutely not. That's when my mom marched back in from inspecting in my bedrooms. Daniel has four kids and another on the way. You're being selfish, living in all this space alone. My dad nodded from the doorway. It's time you helped family instead of just thinking about yourself. We raised you better than this. The audacity was breathtaking. These were the same people who wouldn't let me park in their driveway when I was literally homeless. Now they wanted to kick me out of my own house. I pulled out my phone and started recording. Let me get this straight. You want me to give up the house I bought with My own money that I'm paying the mortgage on. So you can live here for free? We're not asking, Dan said, stepping closer like he was trying to intimidate me. We're telling you, family comes first. You owe us. After everything we've done for you. Everything you've done for me? I almost choked. You literally called me a homeless bum and refused to help when I was living in my truck. That was different. My mom snapped. You were irresponsible back then. Now you need to.

But she started shaking when she realized what she had done. We were supposed to leave for Italy The next morning. My husband's whole family was going. Parents, siblings, everyone. This was supposed to be our dream vacation to celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary. I was so excited since I've never been to Europe before. But my mother in law, Valerie, has always absolutely hated me. From day one. She's made it crystal clear that she thinks I'm not good enough for her precious son. She's made my life hell for the past three years with constant passive aggressive comments and deliberate exclusions from family events. The worst part? My husband just stands there and lets it happen. He never defends me, never calls her out. It's like he's terrified of mommy dearest. For weeks leading up to this trip, Valerie had been making little comments. Oh, I hope everyone's paperwork is in order. It would be such a shame if someone couldn't make it last minute. These international trips are so complicated. I started getting paranoid, but I thought I was just being crazy. Then my coworker at the print shop jokingly said, you should make a fake passport just in case she tries something. We both laughed, but honestly, something about Valerie's behavior had me worried. So the day before we left, I actually did it. I used our high end printers, At work to create a convincing fake passport. Same photo, same info, but completely bogus. I figured if Valerie was planning something, at least I'd be prepared. That morning, I was in their kitchen finishing my packing when Valerie appeared. She had this weird gleam in her eyes that immediately put me on edge. You know what, Amanda? I'm done pretending to like you, she said suddenly, her voice dripping. I've been waiting three years for the perfect moment to get rid of you. Before I could even process what was happening, she lunged for my passport sitting on the counter. I tried to grab it, but she was faster. Oops, looks like you can't come to Italy after all, she said with the most evil smirk I'd ever seen. She pulled out her kitchen lighter and set the passport on fire right there in the sink. I watched it burn completely to ash while she stood there looking absolutely triumphant. Guess you'll have to stay home while we have the time of our lives in Rome, she taunted. That's when I started laughing. Full on belly deep laughter that probably made me look completely unhinged. Valerie's smug expression faltered. What's so funny? She demanded. Valerie, that wasn't my real passport, I said, still giggling as I pulled my actual passport from my back pocket. That was a fake one I made at work yesterday. Her face went from confusion to pure white terror in about two seconds. What do You mean fake? I work at a commercial print shop. We have professional grade equipment. I suspected you'd pull something like this, so I made a decoy. But here's the really fun part, Valerie. I pointed to my phone that had been innocently recording on the counter the whole time. You just commit. Did a federal crime on camera. Destroying what you believed was an official government document is a felony. The fact that it was fake doesn't matter. Your intent was to destroy a real passport. Valerie started physically shaking. Her hands were trembling so badly she could barely speak. You can't. I didn't know. Please don't. Oh, but wait. There's more. I continued, feeling absolutely giddy with satisfied.

My mom's this 4 11 woman who works at a library and knit scarves for charity. But I've watched grown men literally back away from her at grocery stores and cross streets when they see her coming. I found out why last week, and it's absolutely terrifying. When I was 8 years old, some punk teenager kept breaking into cars in our neighborhood. Hit everyone's car multiple times over several months, stealing whatever he could find. Phones, wallets, who's change, anything valuable left visible. This kid was relentless. Didn't care about security cameras or motion lights. Just kept coming back, night after night, like some kind of criminal ghost. One night around midnight, he smashes my mom's passenger window with a crowbar and steals her entire purse. Inside was $800 in cash, a rent money that she just withdrawn from the bank. Also her credit cards, driver's license, house keys, work badge, everything important. We called the police immediately and filed a report. The cops were sympathetic, but said there was nothing they could realistically do. No cameras caught his face, no witnesses saw the break in, no fingerprints on the glass. Just another case number. My mom just nodded politely and thank the officers for their time. She seemed unusually calm about losing $800. Three days later, she spending every afternoon at the library after work, researching on computers for hours, printing out pages of documents, making dozens Of phone calls, taking detailed notes in that tiny, precise handwriting. Turns out she'd figured out who the kid was from security footage at a nearby gas station. Cross reference time stamps, tracked his route backwards. Found his social media from a partial license plate reflection. Found his address, full schedule, friends, family members, job. Everything about his entire life. But here's where it gets absolutely insane. During her investigation, she discovered his mom was having a full blown affair with their neighbor three houses down. Hotel meetings twice a week, romantic weekend trips, secret calls. The whole Betrayal package. My mom spent two weeks documenting everything, like building a legal case. Screenshots, printed emails, credit card statements, photos, meeting times, locations. More thorough than any private investigator. Then she anonymously mailed detailed evidence packages to his dad, his mom's workplace supervisor, grandparents, their church pastor, and half their congregation. She also sent copies to the affair partner's wife, their teenage children, their employers and homeowners association. Both families imploded within 72 hours. Parents screaming in driveways at 2:00am, police showing up for domestic dispute, moving trucks the next week. Mom lost her job, dad filed for divorce. A fair partner's family fell apart. They had to move across town in complete shame. The break in stopped that exact day. Here's how everyone in our neighborhood found out what she did. The kid's dad was so grateful to whoever exposed his cheating wife that he went door to door asking If anyone knew who sent the evidence packages, he wanted to thank them personally. When he got to our house, my mom answered in her floral

My dad said, we didn't think you'd want to come since you barely finished school yourself. I just smiled and said, then don't worry about my ceremony next month. Two weeks later, my cousin posted a selfie standing under a banner with my face on it. That's when the call started. The banner read, Congratulations, Doctor Emma Mitchell, Suma Cum Laude. My phone exploded with notifications from family members who'd written me off years ago. See, my family always saw me as the failure. My brother Jake was the golden child. Straight A's, debate Captain, Perfect everything. I had undiagnosed ADHD and struggled with C's and D's. Every dinner became an interrogation about my latest disappointment. Why can't you just apply yourself like Jake? My mom would ask, while my dad shook his head in silent judgment. Jake would sit there looking uncomfortable, but never defended me. The constant comparisons crushed my spirit until I stopped trying altogether. When I graduated high school, barely passing, they threw Jake a lavish party with extended family, friends, and my parents, colleagues, me attends dinner, and a community college pamphlet. We have to be realistic about your capabilities, Emma, my dad said, sliding the brochure across the table like a consolation prize. I moved out the next day with just my Honda Civic and whatever fit in the trunk. My parents seemed almost relieved to see me go. Jake called once to Ask where I was staying, but the conversation was brief and awkward. I found a tiny studio apartment and took a job as a receptionist at a medical clinic to pay the. I visited for holidays and during the pitying looks and pointed questions about when I would get serious about my future, they'd update me on Jake's achievements, his internships, his academic awards, his acceptance to prestigious MBA programs. I just nod and smile. What they didn't know was that working at the clinic had sparked something in me. I found the medical field fascinating, and several doctors noticed my natural aptitude for understanding complex cases. One physician, Doctor Ramirez, took me under her wing. She recognized my ADHD symptoms immediately and helped me get properly diagnosed and treated. You have a brilliant mind, Emma, she told me. You just needed the right tools to access it. With her encouragement, I enrolled in night classes at the community college. For the first time in my life, I experienced academic success. Best my grades were stellar. I discovered that with proper support for my ADHD, I didn't just learn, I excelled. I transferred to a four year university, completed my undergraduate degree with honors, and was accepted to medical school. Throughout this journey, I maintained minimal contact with my family. Holiday visits became phone calls, then just text messages. They never asked about my education, assuming I was still working as a receptionist. A few times I tried mentioning my Classes. But my father would change the subject and my mother would look uncomfortable. Jake was too busy with his own success to notice mine. Only Megan, my cousin on my mother's side, knew the truth. She'd always been kind to me, and when I told her about medical school, she became my biggest cheerleader. She attended every

This house is going up for sale. Everyone cheered and raised their glasses. I stepped outside and made one phone call. Ten minutes later, the screaming started. See, two years ago, when dad had his heart attack, I discovered something. They were three months behind on mortgage payments. The bank was for closing next week. My family had no idea. Dad was too proud how to tell anyone. So I used my entire divorce settlement, $180,000, to buy the house at auction. I created an LLC called Clearwater Holdings and let them keep living there without telling them. I figured I'd transfer it back once they got stable again. Now my brother Marcus thinks he can just sell it and split the money. He's already called two realtors. The irony wasn't lost on me. For two years, I've been quietly paying property taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs. Every time something broke, I'd anonymously arrange for repairs. The new roof last spring. That was me. The HVAC system that mysteriously got warranty coverage. Also me. Marcus had been living rent free in a house I owned, while constantly reminding everyone how successful he was compared to his loser sister. When I walked back inside, he was drawing renovation plans on napkins with his wife Jennifer. We could add a wine cellar, he was saying, gesturing wildly with his beer. And a home theater, Jennifer added, her eyes practical, glowing with dollar Signs! Mom was nodding enthusiastically. Oh, and we could finally get that kitchen island I've always wanted. Dad sat quietly in his chair, looking uncomfortable but not saying anything. He'd always hated confrontation. My teenage nephew, Tyler was on his phone, probably already shopping for the car Marcus had promised him from his inheritance share. Actually, I said calmly, walking back to the dining room table, I need to tell you something important. Marcus didn't even look up from his sketching. If you're gonna beg us to let you stay, save it, he laughed. Decisions made. Jenny already found us a realtor friend who can get us top dollar. Really? I said, sitting down across from him. That's interesting, because I just got off the phone with my attorney. Mom rolled her eyes dramatically. Alex, Honey, you can't afford an attorney. Stop being so dramatic about this. James Morrison from Morrison and Associates, I continued, ignoring her comment. He specializes in real estate law. Dad finally looked up with interest. Why were you talking to a real estate attorney, sweetheart? Because I wanted to understand what happens when someone tries to sell a house they don't legally own. The room went completely silent. Even Tyler looked up from his phone. Marcus's pen stopped moving. What are you talking about? Mom and dad own this house. They've lived here for 30 years. They lived here for 30 years, I corrected calmly. But they haven't owned it for the past 14 months. His face had gone completely pale. Alex, what are you saying? I pulled out my phone and opened the email James had sent me. According to the county property records, this house is owned by Clearwater Holdings, LLC. It was purchased at foreclosure auction 14 months ago for $165,000. Marcus stood up so fast, his chair nearly fell over. That's impossible. There's no way the original owners

I looked at her confused. What trip? I didn't receive anything. My grandmother's face darkened as she turned to my parents. The fifteen thousand dollar graduation trip to Europe I sent for Diego three months ago. The silence was deafening. My mom started fidgeting with her new designer purse, the one that mysteriously appeared last month along with matching shoes. My dad's gold chain suddenly felt heavier around his neck. And I noticed his expensive watch for the first time. We. We thought it would be better if my mom stamp her newly done nails, tapping nervously on the table. If what? Grandma's voice cut like ice. If you stole from your own son. That's when it all clicked. The sudden shopping sprees every weekend. My sister's new iPhone, iPad and MacBook. Family vacation to Cancun that I wasn't invited to. A kitchen renovation. Dad's new motorcycle sitting in our driveway. They'd stolen my graduation gift and spent it on themselves like it was Christmas morning. My sister Estania, who never worked a day in her life, was wearing earrings that cost more than my monthly gas station salary. Diamond studs that sparkled under the restaurant lights. She and even look up from her plate, too busy admiring her fresh manicure. You gave them everything their entire lives, I said quietly, my voice shaking with years of suppressed anger. And they took the One thing meant for me. The one thing I actually earned. Grandma stood up, her chair scraping against the floor loud enough to make nearby diners turn. 20 years I've watched you favor Estania over Diego like he's invisible. I sent that money specifically for him. With a letter explaining every detail of the trip I planned. My mom's face went white as paper. We never got a letter, I swear. Because you threw it away after cashing the check that had his name on it. The restaurant felt silent, despite other diners around us. Even the waiters seemed to sense the drama unfolding at our table. I couldn't hold back anymore. This explains everything. Why you suddenly had money for mom's Botox appointment and weekly spa days. Why dad bought that Harley Davidson he's been wanting for years. Why Estonia got her nose job and started posting Instagram photos from five star hotels every single week. My grandmother's eyes widened with each revelation. Nose job? Instagram photos? Show me. I pulled out my phone and showed her Estonia's recent posts. Bullside shots at luxury resorts in Miami. Designer shopping halls from Rodeo Drive. First class plane seats with champagne glasses. Expensive restaurant meals that cost more than I made in a week. All time stamped from the past three months. Right after my graduation, I've been working 70 hour weeks at the gas station just to afford my rent and groceries. I continued my voice, getting stronger, eating ramen Noodles for dinner. While watching them feast like royalty, I thought maybe you'd forgotten about my graduation. Or maybe you were disappointed in me. But this whole time, they were living off money meant for me. Grandma scrolled through the photos, her face getting redder with each. This hotel cost $800 a night. I know because I stayed there last year. And this restaurant, their appetizers start at $50. My dad tried to interrupt, loosening his collar nervously. Mom, if you'd just let us explain in the situation. Explain what, Nelson? How you forged my grandson's signature on bank documents? How you intercepted mail addressed specifically to him? How you've been lying to my face for months while spending his money? She reached into her purse and pulled out a thick envelope with legal documents. I brought copies of everything. The bank transfer with Diego's name, the hotel reservations in his name, the flight confirmations, the detailed itinerary. I spent weeks planning for his graduate

This morning, my phone exploded with 32 missed calls. It happened at Connor's birthday party. Lauren stood up during dinner and announced to our entire friend group, I've been seeing someone else. I need a real man, not a kindergarten teacher who makes 30 K a year. Everyone went silent. Then Connor actually started clapping. Finally. We've all been saying, you deserve better. The whole table nodded like they'd rehearsed this. I just smiled, put down my fork, and walked out. No drama, no begging. What? They didn't know. I've been teaching kids during the day, but spending nights getting my pilot's license. My broke teacher savings account actually had 180 K from cryptocurrency investments I'd made 3 years ago. But here's the real kicker. My uncle had been battling cancer for months. He owned a small aviation company that did scenic tours and flight training. Two days before Connor's party, he'd asked me to take over the business when he retired. The company was worth 1.2 million, debt free. I've been keeping it quiet while I finished my commercial pilot certification. Lauren knew about my uncle's business, but thought it was just some tiny operation with a couple old planes. She had no idea about the government contracts, the corporate partnerships, or the fact that we were expanding into helicopter tours next year. The night she humiliated me, I called my Uncle and said yes to everything. We started the paperwork immediately. I'd also been secretly applying to international schools. Teaching abroad had always been my dream, but Lauren constantly shut it down, saying it was unrealistic and running away from responsibility. The next week, I put in my transfer request to teach at an international school in Dubai. Posted one photo on Instagram. Me in the cockpit of a small plane with the caption new adventures. Lauren's new real man. Turns out he was married with two kids. His wife found their texts and posted everything on Facebook, tagging Lauren's workplace. She got fired from her marketing job for the drama. The guy's wife also sent screenshots to Lauren's parents, were mortified their daughter was involved with a married man. Meanwhile, my Dubai teaching position came with an 80 five k salary, free housing, and I started a weekend flight instruction business. But the real money came from taking over my uncle's company. Within two months, I'd expanded to corporate charters and landed a contract with a luxury resort chain worth 400 k annually. Connor started following my Instagram again after seeing photos of me flying over Dubai skyline. Even posted a comment, dude had no idea you were doing all this. Tanya from our friend group sent a DM. We all feel terrible about that night. Too late for fake friendship. And even faker.

And now he's crying to me because all our major clients followed me out the door. Ricardo strutted into my annual review 30 minutes late, laughing on the phone about firing someone who'd asked for maternity leave. He hung up, looked at me like I was dirt on his shoe, and said he had 10 minutes before his massage appointment. I'd save this company from bankruptcy three times, built our entire client base from nothing. And he once introduced me at a conference as the help. But I personally convinced major corporations to trust us. I started explaining why I deserved a raise after 10 years, and he looked at me like I was the biggest moron in the room. You want 30% more for what? Answering emails and phone calls? He laughed like I told a joke. Look at this. He spun his laptop around, showing me a job posting, my exact position, offering half my salary. I could hire two college kids to do your job. How? I could train my assistant to do what you do in a week. Ricardo, those three big accounts only work with us because. Because we're cheap and convenient, not because you're some irreplaceable genius. He stood up, walking to his window that overlooked the parking lot. You know what your problem is? You think you matter. You think these clients care about you. They don't. They care about rates and delivery times. You're just the voice on the phone. Replaceable. That word hung in the air like a slap. The phone rang, interrupting the moments. Ricardo's assistant knocked and entered, looking nervous. Sorry, but Mister Tanaka from our biggest client is online. One? He's asking for her specifically. She nodded toward me. Ricardo's face went red. Transfer him to me. I'm the CEO here. I tried. He said he only deals with her. Ricardo grabbed the phone, punching buttons. Aggressive. Mister Tanaka? This is Ricardo, the CEO. What can I do for you? His face changed as he listened. Without a word, he handed me the phone. Turns out they had a shipping crisis, which I fixed in five minutes. Something Ricardo couldn't have understood if I'd explained it for hours. When I hung up, he was furious. See? Simple problem. Anyone who knows our system could have fixed that. You're not special. You're not irreplaceable. You're convenient. That's it. So no raise, then? No raise. In fact, you should be grateful I don't cut your pay to match what I could hire someone else for. You want my advice? Shut up and do your job. Or test how replaceable you really are. I spent the weekend making phone calls. First to Mister Tanaka, then to our second biggest client, then our third. Three conversations, three confirmations. They didn't do business with the company. They did business with me. By Sunday night, I had three job offers from competitors and more importantly, three clients. Ready? Follow me. Monday morning, I walked into Ricardo's office and handed him my resignation, effective immediately. He actually smiled as he read it. Running to a competitor. Good luck starting from zero. You'll be begging for this job in a month. He was already pulling up recruiting websites. I'll have someone in your chair by Friday, probably.

My mother in law, Gloria, spent last Christmas going through every single gift bag at my house like a crazy person. She was getting more and more frantic with each bag she checked. Gloria had been giving me the worst gifts for years. Last year on my birthday, she handed me this old candle that said happy 50th on it. When I was only 32, the price tag from some garage sale was still stuck on it, showing 75 cents. And for Christmas, she gave me a cookbook called cooking for one. Even though I've been married to her son for five years. Inside, someone named Janet had written good luck, Janet in pen. When I tried bringing it up, she just laughed. Often say the thought is what counts. But when her birthday rolled around, she expected the exact perfume she wanted and specific jewelry she'd been eyeing. She literally cried once because her gift came in a regular box instead of a fancy gift bag. My husband stood there watching me wrap Gloria's Christmas present in wrinkled paper from last year. Inside was the foot spa she gave me last month with a thrift store sticker still on it for $12 on Christmas morning. Gloria unwrapped it and her face went pale. This looks familiar, she said slowly. Found it at a cute little shop, I told her. Two months later, for her birthday, I gave Her. That cooking for one cookbook with a sticky note over Janet's message. She opened it in front of her whole book club and the room went silent. I knew something was off, but couldn't figure out what. Mother's Day came and she was nervous opening my gift. It was the happy 50th candle with the 75 cent tag. I'm 67, she said. It's decorative. Age is just a number for her anniversary. She actually shook the box before opening it. Inside was a singing fish from their garage that she'd given my husband three years ago. The batteries were dead. This time she stared at me for a full 10 seconds before forcing a thank you. By summer, Gloria was losing it. She'd started keeping a notebook, writing down what she gave people. At her sister's birthday party, she unwrapped the purse with a broken zipper and immediately looked at me. I just smiled. Thanksgiving came and she refused to open my gift in front of anyone. But her husband grabbed it and opened it for her. Wine glasses with dolphins. These were in our donation box, said Gloria. Grabbed his arm hard. No, they weren't, she said quickly. But now he was suspicious, too. At my birthday in November, Gloria gave me an envelope with cash. Thought this would be easier, she said, watching me carefully. I thanked her warmly. She looked relieved. Then Christmas decorations started going up and Gloria got tense again. Our family Christmas party. Was packed with relatives. Gloria kept her gift from me in her lap, not opening it. Her sister Barbara kept asking her to open it so everyone could see. Finally Gloria gave in and started unwrapping it slowly. Inside was a crystal vase with a massive crack down the side. Gloria went still. Barbara leaned over to look at it. The whole room was watching. Now wait, Barbara said, picking it up. Gloria, isn't this grandma's vase? The one you dropped at Easter Five years ago? My father in law stood up to look closer. You told

I moved out the next day with just my Honda Civic and whatever fit in the trunk. My parents seemed almost relieved to see me go. Jake called once to ask Where I was staying, but the conversation was brief and awkward. I found a tiny studio apartment and took a job as a receptionist at a medical clinic to pay the bills. I visited for holidays, and during the pitying looks and pointed questions about when I would get serious about my future, they'd update me on Jake's achievements, his internships, his academic awards, his acceptance to prestigious MBA programs. I just nod and smile. What they didn't know was that working at the clinic had sparked something in me. I found the medical field fascinating, and several doctors noticed my natural aptitude for understanding complex aces. 1 physician, Doctor Ramirez took me under her wing. She recognized my ADHD symptoms immediately and helped me get properly diagnosed and treated. You have a brilliant mind, Emma, she told me. You just needed the right tools to access it. With her encouragement, I enrolled in night classes at the community college. For the first time in my life, I experience experienced academic success. My grades were stellar. I discovered that with proper support for my ADHD, I didn't just learn, I excelled. I transferred to a four year university, completed my undergraduate degree with honors, and was accepted to medical school. Throughout this journey, I maintained minimal contact with my family. Holiday visits became phone calls, then just text messages. They never asked about my education, assuming I was still working as a receptionist. A few times I tried mentioning my Classes. But my father would change the subject, and my mother would look uncomfortable. Jake was too busy with his own success to notice mine. Only Megan, my cousin on my mother's side, knew the truth. She always been kind to me, and when I told her about medical school, she became my biggest cheerleader. She attended every milestone. My white coat ceremony, my clinical rotations, my research present tentations. The day before Jake's NBA graduation dinner, I called my parents one last time. Are you sure there's no room for me tomorrow? I asked. Emma, we've been through this. My dad said it's for people who've actually accomplished something academically. That's when I knew I was done hiding. At my medical school graduation, Megan sat in the front row beaming

My best friend Claire was dying and needed me to make her a promise that would destroy my marriage. We were sitting in the hospice room while her three kids colored in the hallway when she grabbed my hand and asked me to adopt them after she was gone. Her boys were 11 and 9, and her daughter had just turned 7. Their dad had overdosed two years earlier, and with Claire's parents dead and her sister in Germany, there was nobody else. I wanted to say yes immediately, my husband had already told me that if I even considered taking them, we were done. Our son Caleb, was 12 and severely autistic, requiring constant supervision that consumed our entire lives. My husband worked nights so I could work days, and we tagged each other like wrestlers because Caleb couldn't be left alone for five minutes without potentially hurting himself. We hadn't been on a date in three years or had a conversation that wasn't about therapy, schedules, or medications. Adding three traumatized kids would push us past our breaking point, and he had made it clear he would leave before letting that happen. But Claire was the only person who showed up when Caleb was diagnosed while everyone else disappeared. She brought groceries when I couldn't leave the house and watched him during meltdowns so I could shower, and never acted like we were A. The social worker visited the day after Claire died, and the visit went exactly as I expected. Caleb had a meltdown when she arrived and spent 40 minutes hitting himself while I tried to calm him down. My husband stood in the corner with arms crossed while the social worker took notes and asked how we would manage three additional children when we were clearly overwhelmed. He laughed out loud at that question and walked out, slamming the door so hard the picture frames rattled. The kids were in emergency foster placement for 72 hours, then would be separated into different homes unless family stepped forward to take them. The oldest had started wetting the bed and refusing to eat, while the middle boy wouldn't speak and just sat humming and rocking. The little girl kept asking when Mommy was coming back from heaven. My husband found me crying in Caleb's room and delivered the ultimatum I had been dreading since Claire asked for my promise. If you do this, I'm filing for divorce and seeking primary custody of Caleb because you're being irresponsible with his care. The words came out flat and mechanical, the way he processed anything too heavy to feel. Part of me understood, because Caleb would suffer if we tried integrating three grieving children into our controlled routine. But the oldest had memorized every Pokemon and could talk about them for hours, which would connect with Caleb's identical obsession. The middle child moved like a Ghost and wouldn't disturb Caleb's need for predictability, while the little girl understood different meant special because Claire had taught her that these weren't random foster kids. The children who knew our house and called me Auntie, with nobody else who even knew their middle names. The foster family called that night because the little girl wouldn't stop screaming, and the oldest had tried running away twice looking for my house. The little girl's wailing came through the phone, begging for her mommy or me or anyone who smelled familiar. While the foster mother asked if I could fix this over the phone. My husband watched from the doorway as I lied that everything would work out when we both knew the system would swallow them whole. You can't save everyone, he said after I hung up. But the

Growing up, Kenzie never let me forget my place in our friendship. Every party, every hangout, every introduction came with the same unspoken rule. I was the designated ugly fat friend who made her shine brighter. This is my friend who's really funny, she'd say, which everyone knew meant not pretty. It hurt every single time. Kenzie was gorgeous, I knew that. But her constant reminders made me believe I was worthless. Was I really that hideous? When I was 22, something shifted. I needed a physical outlet for my anxiety and found a groupon for a rock climbing gym across town. The first day, my hands shook on every hold. But something about solving each route, finding my path up the wall, made me feel powerful. That's when I discovered my escape. I started climbing four nights a week in secret. My hands bled, then calloused. Ice my forearms after every session. Watch technique videos until 2:00am, practice grip strength exercises at my desk. Wednesday and Friday nights, I climbed with the regulars, including this guy, Sebastian, who became my climbing partner. We spot each other, celebrate sends, build genuine friendship through shared challenges. I never mentioned him to Kenzie. She wouldn't care about my gym friends anyway. Meanwhile, Kenzie had become obsessed with her marketing firm crush. She constantly prove I was the ugly friend by making me stand Next to her in mirrors. See the difference? She'd say, adjusting her hair. Some people just have it. Others are good listeners. She'd drag me shopping, hold up identical outfits against us both. This would look cute on me. You should stick to black. It's slimming. What killed me was how she document everything on Instagram, always cropping me out or positioning me behind her natural beauty. She option photos where I was literally holding her phone's ring light. I started wondering if she was right. Maybe I was fooling myself, thinking climbing made me worth something. Kenzie's birthday party was approaching. This rooftop bar event she'd been planning for months. She'd invited her entire office, especially her crush. He finally rsvp'd. Yes! She squealed. I need you there. don't talk too much. Just laugh at my jokes and leave early if I give you the signal. The night of the party, she made me wear this shapeless black dress. It's so you. She lied. As guests arrived, she positioned me strategically. Visible enough to make her look charitable for having an ugly friend, hidden enough not to distract. Then her crush walked in with three friends. Kenzie grab my arm, whispered, remember your wallpaper. But when he scanned the crowd, his eyes stopped on me. His whole face lit up. Oh, my god, red! He called out, using my climbing nickname. Kenzie froze. Sebastian practically ran over his friends, trailing behind. Guys, this is the girl I've Been telling you about the one who sent that impossible 5 11 route last week? He turned to me, eyes bright with genuine excitement. I can't believe you're here. Wait. You know, Kenzie, for the next hour, Sebastian couldn't stop talking about our climbing adventures. He told everyone about the time I helped him overcome his fear of overhangs, how I taught him this specific heel hook technique, how watching me climb had made him a better athlete. His friends already knew stories.

I found out why at our wedding. I'm getting ready in the bridal suite, and my bridesmaids just left for coffee. Finally alone for a minute. Here's what you need to know about the man I'm about to marry. I moved across the country for him. California to Maine. Do you know how cold Maine is? But the way he looked at me at the airport that first day, holding that stupid handmade sign that said, my California sunshine made every frozen morning worth it. I nursed his mother through chemo last year. Held the okay while she threw up at 3:00am. Cleaned it, held her hand. She grabbed my face once between treatments and whispered, you saved my son. That's when I knew we were real family. When he lost his job, he went through the darkest six months. Some days, I'd have to guide him to the shower, help him remember to eat. He'd play call of duty until 4:00am because he said it was the only thing that kept the anxiety quiet. But watching him fight through it, watching him slowly come back to life, that's real love. When he finally got better, he proposed by hiding the ring in my first edition Harry Potter, the one my grandmother left me. He was so nervous, he accidentally cut too deep and destroyed the binding. He literally cry. I'd when he realized what he'd done. Still checks every antique bookstore. We passed, determined to find a replacement. That's my future husband. He messes up, but never stops trying to fix it. Now, I knew we couldn't afford a very lavish wedding, but the main thing I wanted was for my wedding dress to have pockets. I know, silly, but I needed something to hold on to when I get nervous. Something that's just mine. Searched everywhere for months. Finally found this ivory silk dress with hidden pockets so deep I could bury my whole hands. Don't care about lace or beating or whatever. Just wanted those pockets. My mom says I'm weird, but my fiance gets it. He always gets me. The ceremony is beautiful. He actually cries when he sees me. His mother, cancer free now, mouths thank you, and I almost lose it. The photographer whispers, we're the most in love couple she's ever shot. Everyone's crying happy tears. My dad actually smiles for the first time since mom died. We wrote our own vows. He looks me in the eyes and promises to always be honest and never keep secrets, as he can't wait to start a family when the time is right. I believe him. Every single word. Reception starts, and his coworker shows up late looking green. Like, actually green. She keeps staring at me during dinner. With his face. It's like. Like she's at a funeral. I saw her try to approach me twice, but my husband intercepts. She's drunk, he says. But I'm Watching her. She's drinking water during our cake cutting. She's sobbing in the corner. Not pretty tears. Ugly crying. My hands find my pockets. That nervous thing I do when I noticed there's paper. Thick paper. I excuse myself to the bathroom, and the coworker follows me, mascara streaming down her face. I'm so sorry. I tried to tell you before. My heart's pounding. Tell me what? He's gasping between sobs. Check your pocket. I paid your Taylor to put it there. You deserve to know. Then she bolts. I can't breathe. My hands shake as I pull out the paper. It's a sonogram. Three months old. On the back and purple pen. I'm keeping it. You deserve to know.

Then her friend told me, I'd make you mine tonight. She panicked for months. My situationship cried about how much she needed me for her birthday. I spent all morning decorating her place while she was at the spa I paid for. When she walked through the door and everyone yelled, surprise! She's squealed and hugged every single person except me. Oh, my god, you guys are the best! She gushed, talking to everyone while I stood there holding the custom cake I'd ordered three weeks go. She literally walked around me like I was furniture. She ignored me while I tried to wish her a happy birthday. When her cousin asked, who's that guy by the cake? She actually said, oh, that's just Harry. He helped out a bit. Helped out? I'd literally coordinated every single person in this room and paid for everything. You must be the famous Harry. Set a voice beside me as I set the cake down, I learn to find her best friend, Ariel, who I'd heard about constantly but never met. She was visiting from Seattle for the party. Brunette with kind eyes. Famous might be a stretch, I said, watching her take selfies with everyone while I became invisible in her living room. Ariel followed my gaze. She always does this, doesn't she? Keeps people at arms length while making them think they're close. She picked up a champagne glass. I've watched her do It since college. You seem different, though. Let me guess, Ariel continued, studying me. You met on Tinder. She said she wanted something real. The first date was perfect, right? Told you she could see something special with you. I stared at her, stunned. How did you? Because that's her script, Ariel said simply. Same one she used on the last three guys. Did she cry about her ex ruining her ability to trust? Ariel's words hit something deep. Eight months of I need more time to figure out what I want. Eight months of being introduced as just my name. Eight months of watching her keep her options open while I closed mine completely. Last month, when I brought not being exclusive again, she cried. Said I was pressuring her, that she thought we were perfect how we were. I'd apologized. Apologized for wanting to be her boyfriend officially. You decorated this whole place, didn't you? Ariel said, looking at the rose gold theme. I spent hours perfecting because I knew it was her favorite. Her friends told me you coordinated everything. Even drove to three different stores to find those specific balloons. Nodded, watching her show some guy her tinder matches while laughing with her cousin. She deleted tinder, right? Ariel asked. Of course not, I said. She needs it for networking. You know what's crazy? Ariel continued. In all our calls, she's never once called you her boyfriend. But she loses it when you don't text back. Fast enough. The truth of it stung. Just last week, she'd shown up at my apartment at 2:00am, crying because I'd fallen asleep and missed her calls, convinced I was with someone else. Ariel moved closer, her voice dropping. I came here to visit her, but really, I wanted to meet you. She talks about you constantly, but only when she's worried you might leave. It's always Harry might be seeing someone else. Or Harry didn't heart my message. Across the room, I saw her notice us talking. She immediately stopped mid conversation with her cut.

So I became everyone's plus one. My wife Angela walked into the living room holding two wedding invitations while I was watching TV. I need to bring grant to these weddings, she said. Grant was her twenty year old assistant at work. Why grant? I asked, genuinely confused. My whole department will be there if I bring you. Everyone gossips about me playing favorites with him since I'm his boss, but if we go together as co workers, it looks better. She said it like she'd been practicing this speech. Plus, my annual review is next month. My boss will be at both weddings watching everything. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. You're taking grant as your date instead of your husband? It's eject for my promotion. She waved the invitations at me. You hate weddings anyway. You always complain about the small talk. That was true, but this felt wrong. Fine, I said, take Grant. Angela smiled like she'd won the lottery. I knew you'd be logical about this. First wedding came around and Angela spent two hours getting ready, trying on three different dresses before leaving with grant at noon. I was sitting on the couch feeling pretty weird about the whole thing, when my phone rang at 2. It was Ryan from my gym. Hey man, you coming to my wedding today? I nearly dropped my phone. Your wedding is today? Yeah. Didn't Angela tell you? She works with my dad. You're on the list. I looked at the invitation stuck on our fridge, and my heart started racing. She said she was bringing someone else. I told him. So what? I invited you separately. We basketball three times a week. An hour later, I walked into that wedding feeling like I was about to cause chaos. Angela's face went completely white when she spotted me at the bar, and I'm not gonna lie, it felt pretty good. She basically sprinted over with grant trailing behind, looking confused. What are you doing here? Ryan invited me from basketball. You didn't tell me Ryan was getting married. You didn't ask whose wedding it was. Her boss appeared beside us, holding a beer. Oh, good, you're both here, he said, and his face changed. Wait. Why aren't you sitting together? Angela's mouth opened and closed like a fish. Grant needed to network. Her boss looked between us, and I could see him putting pieces together. You brought him instead of your husband? The words just hung there. It's complicated, Angela stammered. Her boss walked away, shaking his head, and I knew this was already backfiring. Three weeks later was the second wedding, and Angela left with grant again like nothing had happened. This time, I didn't need a phone call, though. The bride, Julie, was my cousin's best friend, and she'd invited me months ago when she heard Angela Couldn't make it. I just never corrected Angela's Assumption about whose wedding it was. I showed up early to help set up chairs, and when Angela walked in with grant, she literally froze in the doorway. How was all she managed to say? Julie invited me. She's basically family. You knew? You never asked. The reception was absolutely brutal for Angela. Her co workers kept coming up to me looking concerned. Are you two separated? One asked. No. Angela just prefers bringing grant to weddings, I said loud enough for others to hear. Mother pulled me aside, looking uncomfortable. Is she having an affair with him? You'd have to ask her, I replied. By the time speeches started, the entire department was whispering and shooting looks at their table. Grant looked like he wanted to crawl under the table and die. Angela kept trying to do damage control, but every word made it sound worse. Her co workers exchanged these knowing looks that made her face turn red. Her boss found me during dessert and pulled me aside.

I tried to explain to the six armed officers that I didn't know anything about any murders, but my neighbor Karen held up her iPad, showing a Powerpoint titled Serial Killer Next Door evidence by Karen. She flipped to the first evidence slide, looking at me with a smug I got you this time, Beach Express. It began three months ago, Karen said, like a modern day Sherlock Holmes. She noticed I kept odd hours and had blackout curtains on all my windows. The first incident happened when she saw me dragging heavy black garbage bags to my car at two in the morning. The next day, she found red stains all over my driveway that looked exactly like blood. She started documenting everything for the safety of the neighborhood. He would have delivery trucks come to this house at night with tattooed men unloading large packages and body sized boxes. He took every single one down to his garage and came out with black bags once he's finished the job. Our other neighbors who had come out to check on the scene gasped at the horrific Powerpoint. Full pictures of the men, the suspicious truck, and me wearing protective eyeglasses and an apron stained with something red. Karen flipped through more extensive evidence. Photos of body parts visible through my garage window, recordings of Bonesaw sounds at midnight, even a video of me splashed with a Red liquid while holding a chainsaw. I'm telling you now. Oh, it's not what it looks like, I said, trying to hold back my laughter. Karen laughed. We're not blind. Don't even try to play your tricks on us. You're just another Jason wannabe. Jason Derulo? I teased. What the. No. Jason Vorhees from those horror films? You know what? Never mind. She flipped through more pieces of evidence. The ring doorbell recording of me handing over a red stain in suitcase to the delivery men, and a picture of a shrunken head in my car. When the officers saw the footage of a victim who sat in my living room, pale and unmoving, they panicked. Check the property. Start with the garage. Go! The officers entered my garage with weapons drawn and found mannequins on professional racks with latex limbs hanging to dry. They found containers of the red liquid labeled corn syrup mix Episode 6 and a toy chainsaw tagged testing zombie scene 4B. They clicked on different files from my computer, listening to different creepy sound effects and screams. Oh, hey, wasn't this on strange? Your things on something, one officer said, recognizing one of the props. He whistled at the three thousand dollar invoice attached. Another officer picked up the body part that was seen on Karen's Powerpoint and realized it was just foam latex. They brought out a few of them to the lawn. Karen's hands shook as she picked up the lightweight props. I Don't understand, she mumbled. That's when I explained everything. I used to work corporate until I lost my job. And I figured, you know, maybe I could start over, do something I really loved. So I got into special effects, became an artist. I loved horror movies and wanted to make

Everyone in the church went dead silent because we all knew the bride's name wasn't Susie. The groom's face went white and Janice's voice cracked when she said, who's Susie? I stood there as maid of honor, holding her bouquet, watching her eyes fill with tears just thinking her fiance had another woman. An elderly woman in the back stood up and pointed directly at me. That's her! That's Susie! The whole church turned to stare at me, include putting my best friend Janice. But I was just as confused as everyone was in the room. My mom rushed out of her pew and ran to the altar before the old woman could finish walking down the aisle. Mom grabbed my arm, trying to pull me away from the ceremony. We need to leave right now! Janice grabbed my other arm, crying, did you sleep with my fiance? Mom tugged my arm harder. The old woman reached the altar and slammed her cane down onto the marble floor with a bang. Please let me speak to my granddaughter in peace before it's too late. The entire congregation whispered with questions and rumors. My mom hissed, stay away from us! Everyone stared at her like she was crazy. The Old woman ignored her, pulling out a travel sized photo album. This is your father holding you as a baby. This is you in my arms. This is our family. The kind looking man in the photos looked exactly like me. Same eyes, same hair color, even same smile. My mom tried to grab them, screaming, you have no right to do this here! This is a wedding! She deserves to know her father loved her and that he left this world trying to find her. She yelled back in a voice so clearly in pain that it made the entire church go quiet. My Grandmother's voice calmed. Your mother took you away when you were just a toddler. Changed her name, changed yours. But by some miracle, I found you. Now we can be complete again. She held out her hand with a soft smile. Please. I nearly grabbed it until my mom burst out with a horrifying truth. Took her away number. There was a restraining order against you. The church gasped, watching more drama slowly unfold. Ask her why, my mom demanded confidently. I looked at my grandma, whose face now changed from sweet and sympathetic to something cold and judgmental. She kept her mouth shut. My mom laughed. That's right. You can't say it, can you? Your grandmother drove your father to his last breath. She is the reason he's gone. And the reason I fled with you in my arms on the night before the Funeral. You poisoned him against his own family. My grandmother screamed back, slamming her cane against the floor again, this time with shaking hands. Even now you deny it. Right there at the altar, my mom announced the truth. My grandmother had refused to believe her son had bipolar disorder and needed medication. She kept telling him the doctors were wrong.

Growing up, my sister Kayla made everything about her. My birthday parties, she got gifts, too, because I wouldn't exist without her. Every graduation, every achievement hijacked. When I won the science fair in 8th grade, she convinced my parents to throw her a supportive sister party the same night. When I got into college, she announced her engagement at my Celebration dinner. When I graduated with honors, she showed up in a revealing red dress and spent the whole ceremony flirting with professors. The pattern never stopped. Kayla had this way of making herself the victim. Whenever I achieved anything, you're so lucky, she'd say. I sacrificed so much for you. Growing up. Meanwhile, I was the one babysitting her kids while she partied through her 20s. I was the one lending her money she never paid back. I was the one covering for her when she bailed on family obligations. When I got engaged to my Indian fiance, Priya, I was terrified Kayla would find a way to ruin it. Sure enough, at our engagement party, she immediately joked about wearing white to our wedding. It'll be so funny, she laughed, like in the movies, I'll be the mysterious woman in white. She even made this dramatic pose, hand on her forehead like some soap opera actress. I pulled her aside and told her, absolutely not. This is my one day. Kayla, please. She rolled her eyes and said I was being dramatic, that it was just a joke. God, you're so sensitive. It's not like anyone would actually confuse me for the bride. But she seemed to agree to drop it. Two weeks later, I found out she'd gone behind my back and asked Priya directly, your sister seems really excited about her dress choice. Priya mentioned casually over dinner, she kept asking about fabric and styles. My blood ran cold. I knew exactly what that meant. I freaked out on Priya explaining Kayla's entire history of stealing my moments. She did this at my high school graduation, wore this attention grabbing red dress and flirted with all the dads. My college graduation, she announced her pregnancy. She'll definitely show up in some elaborate white gown designed to make everyone look at her instead of us. That night, I had a complete breakdown, sobbing, hyperventilating. 28 years of suppressed resentment came pouring out. I was convinced Priya would see my toxic family dynamics and run for the hills. Who wants to marry into that kind of drama? Instead, she held me and said something genius. You know, white isn't the bridal color in Indian weddings, right? I froze. In all my panic about Kayla's manipulation tactics, I completely forgotten that crucial detail. Kayla had no idea Priya would be wearing a stunning red lehenga with intricate gold embroidery. Wedding day arrives. I'm getting ready with my groomsmen when my cousin Texts, dude, your sister just walked in looking like she thinks she's the bride. My stomach dropped until I remembered Priya's words. Then I actually started laughing. Kayla struts in wearing this elaborate white ball gown, strapless with a cathedral train, clearly custom made and expensive. She'd even hired a professional makeup artist, had her hair done in an elaborate updo with white flowers. The confused looks from Priya's family were absolutely priceless. Indian weddings are vibrant, colorful celebrations. And here's Kayla looking like she wandered in from a completely different century. During the ceremony, I kept glancing at Kayla. She looked increasingly uncomfortable as she realized everyone was staring at her for all the wrong reasons. Priya looked absolutely radiant in her traditional red and gold.

I came home from grocery shopping to find thirteen year old Adrian in the living room surrounded by the massacred remains of every single one of two year old Burt's beloved toys. Cotton stuffing everywhere like snow, fabric torn to shreds scattered across the carpet. Burt was screaming so hard his face was purple, while my husband stood over Adrian shouting she's lost her mind! Pointing at the destruction with a shaking finger. I was watching TV with Bert and she just started ripping apart every toy he owns like a psycho. I dropped the grocery bags and ran to pick up Bert, who is sobbing, trying to piece together his favorite teddy bear. Adrian, what have you done? She looked up at me with tears streaming down her face, holding something in her closed fist while my husband grabbed her hard enough to leave marks. Put something shiny in his mouth, she shouted, yanking her hand away from her father. I asked him where he got it and he pointed at his teddy bear. And when I looked inside, I found these. She opened her hand to show a diamond ring, a gold necklace, and several earrings. That's when my husband's face went from angry to a flash of panic. You had no right to destroy his toys over some costume jewelry, he quickly stammered. They were hidden inside the teddy bear, Adrian said, looking At me instead of her father, her voice trembling but determined. Burt could have to death. And I saw dad in here last week with his sewing kit, saying he was fixing rips. My husband laughed, but it sounded forced. I was fixing them because they were falling apart. And that's just jewelry I found at work during my security rounds, he said. I picked up one of the destroyed bears and found a small, neat slit in the back that had been hand sewn shut. The jewelry inside wasn't cheap like he said. It was real diamonds catching the light. You hid jewelry in our baby's toys? I asked. I was going to pawn it, my husband said quickly, but his voice was getting higher and sweat was beating on his forehead. Extra money for the family. You know how tight things have been. The elephant had three rings, the rabbit had a bracelet and earrings. The Dinosaur had a watch. Every single toy had something metal inside that could have killed bird if he swallowed it, Adrian said. You're being dramatic, my husband responded. I made sure the holes were secure, he then stammered. Why not just keep them in a drawer? I asked, staring at jewelry scattered across the floor. Why hide them in baby toys? My husband tried to grab the jewelry from the table, but Adrian was faster, pooping it up and backing away toward the wall. I know why he hid them in the Toys! Adrian said. Give those to me right now! My husband suddenly shot up, moving toward her with his hands outstretched. Adrian ran behind me, pressing against my back. This necklace has an engraving, Adrian said, her voice shaking as she held up a silver chain that caught the light. It says to Ruby, love, mom, on the back. Who's Ruby? I asked innocently. My husband's face started turning. And

My son Brandon texted happy birthday, mom to our family group chat on the wrong day. When I corrected him, he said, close enough, mom. I turned 70 alone that year. Meanwhile, they threw my grandchildren's other grandmother, penny, a surprise 65th with 50 guests and a string quartet. I know because I saw the photos on Facebook. They captioned it, celebrating the world's best grandma. When I had hip surgery, I took the bus home because Brandon was slammed at work and couldn't leave. My daughter Kenzie, had a thing with the kids. Prepared meals standing on a walker, refilled prescriptions myself. Slept in the recliner because I couldn't manage stairs alone. Two months later, Kenzie's mother in law had her gallbladder removed. Kenzie moved in for three weeks. Brandon delivered groceries daily. They hired a private nurse. I watched their children for free every summer while they vacationed in Europe. 10 years of summers. No thank you, no payment. Just mom has nothing else to do. Anyway, they told friends childcare was taken care of like I was hired help. I missed my late husband Gio's sister's funeral because they already booked non refundable tickets. Kensley's mother in law babysits twice a year. They pay her $500 each time because her time is valuable. Christmas morning, I sat alone until 4 p m. Because they went to Kensley's husband David's family first. Traffic was bad, Kinsley explained. Though they live closer to me, my gift was a drugstore candle still priced at three dollars and ninety nine cents. Penny got a weekend spa retreat. I painted Kinsley's wedding portrait for three months. She left it in the basement untouched. Penny's blurry phone photo got framed in gold on the mantle. Kinsley asked me to cater her dinner party, then introduced me as the help when I stayed to serve. The next week, she hired a two thousand dollar chef for Penny's Book Club of six and then drove past my house to take penny grocery shopping during the ice storm that trapped me inside for four days. She doesn't like driving in bad weather, he explained. When I called hungry, neither do I. I said, you'll figure it out, mom. You always do. They started lying to maintain the favoritism. Kenzi told me Thanksgiving was canceled. Family flew. I delivered homemade soup to their door and saw Penny's car in the driveway and heard laughter inside. I walked back to my car crying. When Geo died, they invited penny to the family only viewing. I found out when she hugged me there, saying how honored she felt to be included in such an intimate moment. My own sister wasn't invited because Kenzi said immediate family only. Then something unexpected happened. Penny had been entertaining her country club with story. Kensley confided in her Brandon's fertility struggles, Kensley's anxiety medication, their financial problems. It exploded at a charity Auction. When her drunk friend asked Kensley about her little Prozac situation in front of everyone, Kensley discovered penny had been calling them my son's burden at her book club for years. The woman they'd chosen over me had made them her punchline. After Dio's funeral, I started teaching painting at the community center. Eight year old Manny arrived first. Suspended from school, his grandmother working doubles. I handed him a brush. He stabbed the canvas with rage, then returned the next day. Soon, seven neighborhood kids sprawled across my living room floor, turning feelings into colors. I invited Kensley to see Manny's first painting. Can't today, mom. Maybe later. Later never came. Brandon promised to attend our art show. He forgot. The kids started calling me Grandma D. Their parents invited me to every recital, game, graduation. I taught them Geo's cloud technique, while my own grandchildren didn't know I painted. Three years passed. Manny got into art school with our portfolio. Aisha painted a mural on my garage. Deshawn sold his first painting, bought me roses. My refrigerator bloomed with their art. My phone buzzed with goodnight, Grandma D texts. Meanwhile, I kept reaching out, offered Kinsley painting lessons for her kids there

My dad said, we didn't think you'd want to come since you barely finished school yourself. I just smiled and said, then don't worry about my ceremony next month. Two weeks later, my cousin posted a selfie standing under a banner with my face on it. That's when the call started. The banner read, Congratulations, Doctor Emma Mitchell, Suma Kumlaude. My phone exploded with notifications from family members who'd written me off years ago. See, my family always saw me as the failure. My brother Jake was the golden child. Straight A's, debate Captain, perfect everything. I had undiagnosed ADHD and struggled with C's and D's. Every dinner became an interrogation about my latest disappointment. Why can't you just apply yourself like Jake? My mom would ask, while my dad shook his head in silent judgment. Jake would sit there looking uncomfortable, but never defended me. The constant comparisons crushed my spirit until I stopped trying altogether. When I graduated high school, barely passing, they threw Jake a lavish party with extended family, friends and my parents colleagues. For me, a tense dinner and a community college pamphlet. We have to be realistic about your capabilities, Emma, my dad said, sliding the brochure across the table like a consolation prize. I moved out the next day with just my Honda Civic and whatever fit in the trunk. My parents seemed almost relieved to. Jake called once to ask where I was staying, but the conversation was brief and awkward. I found a tiny studio apartment and took a job as a receptionist at a medical clinic to pay the bills. I visited for holidays and during the pitying looks and pointed questions about when I would get serious about my future, they'd update me on Jake's achievements, his internships, his academic awards, his acceptance to prestigious NBA programs. I just nod and smile. What they didn't know was that working at the clinic had sparked worked something in me. I found the medical field fascinating, and several doctors noticed my natural aptitude for understanding complex cases. One physician, Doctor Ramirez, took me under her wing. She recognized my ADHD symptoms immediately and helped me get properly diagnosed and treated. You have a brilliant mind, Emma, she told me. You just needed the right tools to access it. With her encouragement, I enrolled in night classes at the community college. For the first time in my life, I experience experienced academic success. My grades were stellar. I discovered that with proper support for my ADHD, I didn't just learn, I excelled. I transferred to a four year university, completed my undergraduate degree with honors, and was accepted to medical school. Throughout this journey, I maintained minimal contact with my family. Holiday visits became phone calls, then just text messages. They never asked about my education, assuming I was still working as a receptionist. Few times I tried mentioning my classes. But my father would change the subject, and my mother would look uncomfortable. Jake was too busy with his own success to notice mine. Only Megan, my cousin on my mother's side, knew the truth. She'd always been kind to me, and when I told her about medical school, she became my biggest cheerleader. She attended

Growing up, Kenzie never let me forget my place in our friendship. Every party, every hangout, every introduction came with the same unspoken rule. I was the designated ugly fat friend who made her shine brighter. This is my friend who's really funny, she'd say, which everyone knew meant not pretty it every single time. Kenzie was gorgeous, I knew that. But her constant reminders made me believe I was worthless. Was I really that hideous? When I was 22, something shifted. I needed a physical outlet for my anxiety and found a group on for a rock climbing gym across town. The first day, my hands shook on every hold. But something about solving each route, finding my path up the wall, made me feel powerful. That's when I discovered my escape. I started climbing four nights a week in secret. My hands LED, then calloused. Ice my forearms after every session. Watch technique videos until 2:00am, practice grip strength exercises at my desk. Wednesday and Friday nights, I climbed with the regulars, including this guy, Sebastian, who became my climbing partner. We'd spot each other, celebrate sends, build genuine friendship through shared challenges. I never mentioned him to Kenzie. She wouldn't care about my gym friends anyway. Meanwhile, Kenzie had become obsessed with her marketing firm crush. She constantly prove I was the ugly friend by making me stand Next to her in mirrors. See the difference? She'd say, adjusting her hair. Some people just have it. Others are good listeners. She'd drag me shopping, hold up identical outfits against us both. This would look cute on me. You should stick to black. It's slimming. What killed me was how she document everything on Instagram, always cropping me out or positioning me behind her natural beauty. She'd caption photos where I was literally holding her phone's ring light. I started wondering if she was right. Maybe I was fooling myself, thinking climbing made me worth something. Kenzie's birthday party was approaching. This rooftop bar event she'd been planning for months. She'd invited her entire office, especially her crush. He finally rsvp'd. Yes! She squealed. I need you there. don't talk too much. Just laugh at my jokes and leave early if I give you the signal. The night of the party, she made me wear this shapeless black dress. It's so you. She lied. As guests arrived, she positioned me strategically. Visible enough to make her look charitable for having an ugly friend, hidden enough not to distract. Then her crush walked in with three friends. Kenzie grabbed my arm, whispered, remember your wallpaper? But when he scanned the crowd, his eyes stopped on me. His whole face lit up. Oh, my god, red! He called out, using my climbing nickname. Kenzie froze. Sebastian practically ran over his friends, trailing behind. Guys, this is the girl I've Been telling you about the one who sent that impossible 5 11 route last week? He turned to me, eyes bright with genuine excitement. I can't believe you're here. Wait. You know Kenzie. For the next hour, Sebastian couldn't stop talking about our climbing adventures. He told everyone about the time I helped him overcome his fear of overhangs, how I taught him this specific, like you hook technique, how watching me climb had made him a better athlete. His friends already knew stories about me. Sebastian had apparently been talking about his badass climbing partner for months. Kenzie stood there. Designer dress and perfect makeup useless against authentic connection. How long have you been doing this together? Someone asked. Six months, Sebastian said, then looked at me with this soft expression. Best six months of my week. Every week, Kenzie tried to interject, mentioning the marketing campaign they'd worked on together. Sebastian Bear

My mom has been begging me to put more thought into my appearance for as long as I can remember. I always ignored her because I thought I just look normal. But then she started insulting how I look every day. One morning she stood behind me at breakfast side dramatically and said, for God's sake, just do something different with your hair at least. It would make a world of difference. Just try something new, she pleaded. Anything would be more interesting to girls than this. She pointed to my ruffled head for some reason. That was the last straw. I said sure thing and headed to the bathroom with a new sense of purpose. I started small with a middle part and enough gel to make it look like plastic. Mom seemed pleased at first until she realized I'd used her expensive salon gel and the entire forty dollar bottle gone. It takes product to make changes, I reminded her when she found the empty container. She had to explain to her hairdresser why she needed more gel after one day, and the woman judged her hard for letting her teenage son waste professional products. The next week I went to her barber without telling her and got a perm. Not a settle wave, but a full 1980 style perm that made me look like a poodle. Mom had to Take me to her cousin's engagement party looking like I'd stuck my finger in an electrical socket, and everyone kept asking if it was for a school play. He's experimenting with his look, she explained weekly while her relatives took photos that would definitely end up in the family group chat. Then I discovered temporary hair chalk and started changing colors daily to match my outfits. Blue on Monday, red on Tuesday, purple on Wednesday, leaving colorful smudges on every pillow, towel, and headrest in the house. Mom's white couch looked like a rainbow had died on it, and she had to explain to guests why everything in our house was stained with pastels. Her car's leather seats were permanently tinted pink from the time I wore magenta in the rain. I showed up to her office when she forgot her lunch, sporting tiny braids with ribbon woven through them that I'd spent six hours creating. Her co workers tried not to laugh as I hugged her in front of everyone, leaving her blazer covered in the baby powder I'd used to make the braids look distinguished. Her boss asked if I was going through something, and she had to smile and say she encouraged me to express myself. The man bun phase was particularly rough for her, as I grew it out just long enough to make the world's smallest bun that stuck straight up like an antenna. She had to sit behind me at church while people watched My tiny bun wobble during hymns. The pastor's wife asked if I was becoming Buddhist, and mom had to have a whole conversation about religious tolerance. Then came the frosted tips. Except I didn't go to a salon and used actual cake frosting at first because I misunderstood the term. Mom found me in the bathroom covered in vanilla icing, and even after I used real bleach, my tips were orange instead of blonde. She had to take me to get school photos looking like Guy Fieri's younger brother, and those pictures would haunt us forever. I invested in a crimping iron and started crimping random sections so my head looked like I've been partially electrocuted. Mom begged me to stop, but I reminded her she wanted interesting and nothing was more interesting than asymmetrical crimp. Her mother came to visit and asked why mom was letting me walk around looking like I'd survived a lightning strike. The oils came next. So much hair oil that I looked wet constantly and left grease stains on everything I touched. Mom had to replace three pillowcases and explain to the

I'm a family court clerk, and last week the medinas were divorcing and fighting over who gets to keep the house, claiming the other was too financially reckless to own property. Both kept presenting evidence. He bought a year supply of healing crystals for our cat. He bought a boat. We live in Arizona. She hired a life coach for her succulent plants. Mediator Betty looked like she needed a drink at 9 a m. I'd like to hear from your daughter, since she's listed as a witness. Lola walks in dressed like a tiny accountant, dragging two suitcases and a filing cabinet. She looked like she was moving in permanently. Mediator Betty stares at the luggage mountain. Lola, we're just having a conversation. With all due respect, ma'am, you haven't met my parents. Going to need evidence. Can you tell us about your parents money habits? Lola opens the first suitcase and pulls out a binder. I brought three years of receipts. Receipts? Yes, ma'am. Filed under evidence. My parents shouldn't have credit cards. Betty almost spits out her coffee. Excuse me. Lola opens to a page with colorful charts. I've been tracking their spending since I was 11, ma'am. What kind of spending? Let's start with exhibit A. Lola holds up a next statement. This is Mom's fourth treadmill. She buys a new one every year because this one will be different. They're all in the garage. We Call it the treadmill graveyard. Exhibit B. Dad bought a three thousand dollar espresso machine. He only drinks instant coffee, ma'am. He thought it would inspire him to upgrade. Exhibit C. Mom orders Doordash from the restaurant that's literally next door. Last month she paid forty seven dollars for a twelve dollar sandwich. The restaurant is 40 feet away. And exhibit D, or dad belongs to three different gyms because each one has that special machine. He pays one hundred twenty dollars a month total. He goes twice a month. That's six. $60 per workout. Betty is covering her mouth. Lola, how did you start handling the money? Someone had to pay the electric Bill, ma'am. They kept forgetting it wasn't on auto pay. Lola opens the second suitcase. This is Mom's online boutique phase. She bought wholesale designer handbags from sketchy websites. Our garage looks like a knockoff purse museum. She sold exactly three bags. How. How much did she spend? $8,000, made $75 back. The mediator turns to the mom Missus, Medina. They looked real in the pictures. Lola continues. Dad's no better. He bought a truck to flip it. He put $5,000 of modifications on it. Damaged LED lights underneath that only light pink. And an attached disco ball inside. It's now worth less than before he bought it. May I present exhibit E. Lola pulls out two jars from the filing cabinet. This jar contains all the warranties dad bought that we've actually used. It's empty. This jar contains receipts for every warranty he's purchased. 83 warranties totaling $4,200. You never know when you'll need them. Dad protests. Dad, you bought a 3 year warranty on a 12 dollar phone case. The warranty cost 15 dollars. Lola pulls out a credit card Bill. Mom has a storage unit for her Amazon returns she never returned. She's paying 150 dollars a month to store things she doesn't want. I'll return them eventually. Mom, some of these boxes are from 2,018. What about your father? Betty asks. Dad bought a fishing boat. He gets seasick. He's used it once and threw up. He had to be towed.

My aunt literally hid her purse in her car trunk when she saw me walking up to my grandparents 60th wedding anniversary party. Through the window, I watched my uncle whisper something to his wife and she immediately took off her diamond earrings and shoved them in her pocket. 28 years old and my family still treated me like I was about to rob them blind because I got arrested for shoplifting when I was 15. The whole extended family was there for the anniversary Celebration, which meant I got to experience the full spectrum of their paranoia and disgust. My cousin made a big show of counting the bottles in the liquor cabinet loud enough for everyone to hear while staring directly at me, just making sure we know what we started with. He announced to the room like he was doing everyone a favor. My mother pulled me aside and whispered that she'd already warned everyone to keep their medications locked up because we can't be too careful with your history. I haven't touched anything stronger than coffee in eight years, but she still introduces me to people as her troubled one who's trying to get back on track. My uncle took it to another level when I walked past the room where they piled everyone's coats and he literally stood guard in the doorway blocking my path. The bathroom is the other direction. He Said with this smug little smile that made me want to scream. The anniversary dinner was even worse because they stuck me at the overflow table in the kitchen with the kids under 10, even though there were empty seats in the dining room. One of the teenagers asked why I was sitting with them, and my aunt loudly explained that sometimes adults need to provision 2, which got a huge laugh from the other room. While everyone else ate off my grandmother's China, I got a plastic plate because apparently I couldn't be trusted with anything breakable. My uncle kept walking through to check on things, which meant staring at me like I might pop get the salt shakers while his wife counted the silverware drawer right in front of me. Then my uncle decided to move my grandmother's antique mirror to the garage because he didn't trust me around something that valuable. He was carrying it through the dining room, making another speech about family heirlooms and personal responsibility when he tripped over his own grandson's toy truck and went straight through the sliding glass door. The mirror shattered and a huge shard went straight into his thigh while smaller pieces sliced his arms and neck. Bloods started spurting everywhere in these rhythmic pulses, and everyone just stood there screaming while he turned white and started losing consciousness. My aunt was freaking about calling 9, 1 1, but fumbling with her phone and dropping it in the blood While my mother fainted and my cousin vomited on the carpet, I jumped over the kitchen table and slid through the blood to get to him while ripping off my belt in one motion. Nobody touch anything and someone get me clean towels, vodka from the freezer and super glue from the junk drawer. Now I barked while using my knee to apply pressure above the wound. The femoral artery was nicked and he had maybe three minutes before he bled out. So I used my belt as a tourniquet while everyone stood there frozen. Another cousin finally brought supplies while I worked to stop the bleeding from his neck with one hand and maintained pressure with my knee. When the emts burst through the door seven minutes later, one of.

My best friend Claire was dying and needed me to make her a promise that would destroy my marriage. We were sitting in the hospice room while her three kids colored in the hallway when she grabbed my hand and asked me to adopt them after she was gone. Her boys were 11 and 9, and her daughter had just turned seven. Their dad had overdosed two years earlier, and with Claire's parents dead and her sister in Germany, there was nobody else. I wanted to say yes immediately, my husband had already told me that if I even considered taking them, we were done. Our son Caleb was 12 and severely autistic, requiring constant supervision that consumed our entire lives. My husband worked nights so I could work days, and we tagged each other like wrestlers because Caleb couldn't be left alone for five minutes without potentially hurting himself. We hadn't been on a date in three years or had a conversation that wasn't about therapy, schedules, or medications. Adding three traumatized kids would push us past our breaking point, and he had made it clear he would leave before letting that happen. But Claire was the only person who showed up when Caleb was diagnosed while everyone else disappeared. She brought groceries when I couldn't leave the house and watched him during meltdowns so I could shower, and never acted like we were A burden. The social worker visited the day after Claire died, and the visit went exactly as I expected. Caleb had a meltdown when she arrived and spent 40 minutes hitting himself while I tried to calm him down. My husband stood in the corner with arms crossed while the social worker took notes and asked how we would manage three additional children when we were clearly overwhelmed. He laughed out loud at that question and walked out, slamming the door so hard the picture frames rattled. The kids were in emergency foster placement for 72 hours, then would be separated into different homes unless family stepped forward to take them. The oldest had started wetting the bed and refusing to eat, while the middle boy wouldn't speak and just sat humming and rocking. The little girl kept asking when Mommy was coming back from heaven. My husband found me crying in Caleb's room and delivered the ultimatum I had been dreading since Claire asked for my promise. If you do this, I'm filing for divorce and seeking primary custody of Caleb because you're being irresponsible with his care. The words came out flat and mechanical, the way he processed anything too heavy to feel. Part of me understood, because Caleb would suffer if we tried integrating three grieving children into our controlled routine. But the oldest had memorized every Pokemon and could talk about them for hours, which would connect with Caleb's identical obsession. The middle child moved like A ghost and wouldn't disturb Caleb's need for predictability, while the little girl understood different meant special because Claire had taught her that these weren't random foster kids, but children who knew our house and called me Auntie with nobody else who even knew their middle names. The foster family called that night because the little girl wouldn't stop screaming and the oldest had tried running away twice looking for my house. The little girl's wailing came through the phone, begging for her mommy or me or anyone who smelled familiar. While the foster mother asked if I could fix this over the phone. My husband watched from the doorway as I lied that everything would work out when we both knew the system would swallow them whole. You can't save everyone, he said after I

Growing up, my brother Andrew could literally burn the house down, and mom would blame the matches. When he was 12, he actually did set our garage on fire trying to make a flamethrower. Mom's response was, boys will be boys. At least he's being creative. Meanwhile, I graduated valedictorian and she missed my ceremony because Andrew had a headache that day. Every morning, Andrew got gourmet breakfasts while I ate generic cereal. When report cards came out, my straight A's got a nod, while his C+ in math warranted a Celebration dinner because he really tried his best. Christmas mornings were the worst. Mountains of wrapped gifts for Andrew, practical stuff like socks and school supplies for me. When dad got cancer during my junior year, everything got worse. I was juggling AP classes, working at the library, and helping with dad's medications. Mom hired Andrew a private tutor so the stress wouldn't hurt his precious. The average I was staying up until 3:00am studying after spending hours cleaning up around the house. Dad passed two months before my graduation. Even then, mom barely acknowledged my valedictorian speech because Andrew was having a really hard time. He skipped the ceremony, entirely too emotional. So mom stayed home with him instead of watching me graduate. College was brutal. Despite dad setting up a fun for both of us, it mysteriously disappeared into medical bills. I scrambled for scholarships and loans while mom somehow found money to send Andrew to an expensive sports academy in Florida. He quit after three weeks because the vibe wasn't right. That program cost more than my entire freshman year tuition. I worked my behind off Dean's list every semester. Two part time jobs, living in a tiny apartment shared with three guys. Meanwhile, Andrew was home rent free, finding himself through expensive hobbies. Mom happily funded gaming setup worth $2,000 that's now collecting dust. Season tickets for his sports blogging phase that lasted two months. Fast forward 10 years. I'm killing it as a senior consultant. Finally paid off my loans, living in a nice apartment. Andrew is still at home at 28, trying to become a fitness influencer or whatever his latest phase is. Andrew started texting me about investment advice and business ideas. Mom calling more frequently, making comments about success for children, supporting their parents, sending me articles about family wealth management. I knew something was coming. Last Saturday morning, they show up unannounced. Mom pushes past me into my apartment, doesn't even wait for an invitation. First thing she does is look around like she's appraising the place. Nice setup you got here, she says, running her fingers along my coffee table. Must be doing pretty well for yourself. Andrew flops down on my couch like he owns it. Immediately pulls out his phone, doesn't even say hello. Then mom pulls out an actual spreadsheet. She sits down across from me and spreads it on my dining table like we're having a business meeting. I've been thinking about your family obligations. She starts. You owe me roughly $150,000 for raising you. Medical bills, school supplies, food, housing. I kept all the receipts. She's pointing to different lines on her spreadsheet. Completely serious. Plus, Andrew's got this amazing business opportunity. Fitness coaching app. Revolutionary concept. He just needs about $75,000 to get started. And with your connections, I'm sitting there listening to this insanity, thinking about all those years.

But now the truth came out. I was 22, just started my dream job as a mechanic, when my phone exploded with hate messages. My 16 year old cousin Sarah told everyone I've been sneaking into her room and got her pregnant. Nobody asked for my side. My mom screamed through tears that I was disgusting, asking how she raised such a monster. Dad just hung up on me. My sister Emma blocked me on everything without a word. Even my grandmother, who practically raised me after my parents divorce, hung up crying, saying she was too ashamed to talk to me. Sarah was the family princess. Straight A's, honor roll, church, youth group leader. Every Sunday, I was the high school dropout. Within 24 hours, the whole extended family had turned against me. My aunt posted these long Facebook rants about protecting our children from creeps hiding in our own family. My uncles were leaving voicemails, threatening to beat the hell out of me if they ever saw me again. Cousins I grew up with were sharing screenshots of our old photos with comments like, can't believe I trusted this creep. I waited every single day for police to show up with handcuffs. Every knock on my door made my heart stop. Every unknown phone number sent me into panic attacks, thinking it was detectives or lawyers. I lost everything, piece by piece. My job, At the auto shop because I couldn't focus. Kept making stupid mistakes, showing up late, calling in sick. My boss, Mike, finally sat me down after three months and said whatever was happening at home needed to stay there. But I was too broken to explain. Lost my apartment four months later when I couldn't make rent. Moved in with my buddy Jay Jake, who let me crash on his couch. But even Jake started asking weird questions when family never visited or called. Dude, where's your family? It's been six months and I've never seen a single relative. I made up lies about them living far away, being busy, having drama. Dating became impossible. How do you explain why your entire family disowned you? First girl I tried seeing asked to meet my parents after two months. I panicked and told her they passed in a car accident. She was so sympathetic it made me sick. Second girl saw through everything. When she noticed I had zero family photos in my apartment, no one to invite to anything. She asked Point Blank why I never talked about my family. When I couldn't give her a straight answer, she was gone by morning. Holidays destroyed me completely. Everyone else had somewhere to go, someone to call, someone who cared they existed. I drive past my old neighborhood and see all the cars in my parents driveway. Knowing they were all inside laughing and eating together without me. I finally moved 3 States away to Colorado and started completely over. New job at a different auto shop, new apartment, new friends who knew nothing about my past. For years, I lived like I had no family. Like I just appeared out of nowhere as an adult. Never dated seriously, because I couldn't risk anyone digging too deep into my background. Built walls so high, I forgot what it felt like to trust.

I slammed on the brakes and jumped out of my car. Nora, baby, what are you doing out here? She was shivering violently. And just her school clothes, no coat. Tears frozen on her little cheeks. Daddy locked me out. He said, I can't come back until you get home from work. My heart dropped. It was 9 p m. On a Friday. Jonathan knew I always worked late on Fridays. This wasn't an accident. How long have you been out here? Since you left this morning, she whispered. I scooped her up, feeling how ice cold her little body was, and carried her toward our front door. It was locked. I used my key. Fury building with every step. I found Jonathan exactly where I expected. Sprawled on the couch in his boxers and T-shirt, controller in hand, playing call of duty. The heat was cranked up to 75 degrees. Empty beer cans littered the coffee table. Why was our daughter outside for 12 hours? I tried to keep my voice calm. He didn't even pause his game. She spilled grape juice on my new controller this morning, I told her. Actions have consequences. I stared at him in disbelief. She's 6 years old, Jonathan. She spilled juice accidentally and you left her outside to freeze? Maybe next time she'll be more careful around my stuff. That's when I noticed Nora's pink backpack sitting by the front door. It was stuffed full, bulging at the seams. Her favorite stuffed bunny was sticking out the top. What's this? I pointed at the bag. Jonathan finally paused his game and turned to look at me. There was something cold in his eyes I'd never or seen before. I've been doing a lot of thinking today. While she was outside, he said slowly, this whole family thing isn't working out for me. Nor is too much work, too expensive, too loud. And honestly, I never wanted kids in the first place. The room started spinning. What are you talking about? I'm talking about you taking her and leaving tonight. I already had the locks changed while you were at work. You just got lucky I hadn't switched them out yet. I felt like I was in a nightmare. You're abandoning your own daughter? Nora was still clinging to me, her wet clothes soaking through my work blazer. She was listening to every word, her big brown eyes darting between us. Here's the thing. Jonathan stood up straight like this was all perfectly normal. She's not really mine anyway. I mean, yeah, biologically, whatever. But I never signed up for this dad life. You can have her. The casual cruelty in his voice made me sick. This was the man I've been married to for eight years. The man who used to read Nora bedtime stories. Jonathan, she's your daughter. You can't just watch Me. He picked up his phone. I already talked to my buddy Steven, who's a lawyer. Apparently, if I just voluntarily give up my parental rights, I don't have to pay child support either. Win, win. My hands started shaking, but not from fear. From rage. I pulled out my phone and speed dialled a number I'd hoped I'd never have to use. Hi, Christine, it's Caroline. Remember that emergency custody documentation we discussed months ago? File everything. Tonight. Jonathan's controller slipped from his hands. What are you doing? What you should have expected when you decided to mess with my daughter. I hit another number. Dad, it's happening.

My brother died six months before starting his surgical residency, and my parents decided I would live his life for him. Not metaphorically honor his memory or carry on his spirit, but literally step into every plan he'd made and complete them. If he never died, they transferred his residency spot to my name through connections at the hospital board. And when I protested that I was a year into my teaching certification, my mother collapsed, bobbing that she couldn't lose both children, and my father said the medical school had already processed the paperwork. The takeover started small with clearing out his apartment, but then my mother began forwarding his mail and scheduling his appointments in my calendar. She'd call, pretending to be me to confirm medical conferences, and she signed my name on volunteer shifts at the children's hospital where dying kids expected their favorite resident. My father installed a tracking app on my phone to ensure I was following the schedule he printed, which included 5:00am gym sessions and meal prep Sundays. Because that's what my brother did. They moved his entire wardrobe into my apartment while I was at work and donated all my clothes to charity. I kept accident making things worse by mentioning my actual life. I'm judging the science fair next month, I'd say at dinner, and suddenly my parents were calling my principal saying I'd had a family Emergency. Every normal thing I said became evidence that I was dishonoring his memory, so I Learned to speak only about hospital rotations I was faking and surgical techniques I'd googled. The first day at the hospital, I stood frozen during rounds while the attending asked me to examine a patient's abdomen. My hands shook as I pressed randomly, hoping high school biology would gave me. But the attending's face grew dark and he pulled me aside, asking if I was drunk because no medical student would check for liver enlargement on the wrong side of the body. I mumbled about grief affecting my performance, and he softened, saying my brother would be proud, while never knowing my brother was the only one who'd actually attended medical school. My girlfriend Meredith watched me transform into someone she didn't recognize as I canceled plans for fake emergency surgeries and spoken medical terminology I'd memorized from flashcards. She found me at 3:00am in his scrubs, sobbing over anatomy textbooks, trying to learn four years of medical school before morning rounds. Then my mother invited Eleanor, my brother's fiance, to dinner at my apartment, using my phone while I slept. I woke up to find her in my kitchen cooking my brother's favorite meal, wearing the engagement ring he bought because my mother told her I wanted to. Can you where he left off? Eleanor was crying happy tears, saying she knew my brother sent me to complete their love story, and she'd Already told her parents we were getting married on the date they'd originally planned. Eleanor, you need to leave right now. This is completely insane, I said, and my mother's face went white with rage. She's your brother's soulmate, and you're going to throw that away for some elementary school teacher who makes half what a surgeon's wife deserves? I teach middle school science, and Meredith is a software engineer, but that doesn't matter, because I not my brother, and I'm never going to be him, no matter how many times you make me wear his clothes or sleep in his bed or pretend to understand why the human pancreas does whatever it does. Eleanor dropped the ring and ran out sobbing, while my mother picked it up and tried to force it into my hand, saying the wedding was

She ignored me while I tried to wish her a happy birthday. When her cousin asked, who's that guy by the cake? She actually said, oh, that's just Harry. He helped out a bit. Helped out? I'd literally coordinated every single person in this room and paid for everything. You must be the famous Harry, said a voice beside me as I set the cake down. And to find her best friend, Ariel, who I'd heard about constantly but never met. She was visiting from Seattle for the party. Brunette with kind eyes. Famous might be a stretch, I said, watching her take selfies with everyone while I became invisible in her living room. Ariel followed my gaze. She always does this, doesn't she? Keeps people at arms length while making them think they're close. She pick up a champagne glass. I've watched her do it. Since college. You seem different, though. Let me guess, Ariel continued, studying me. You met on Tinder. She said she wanted something real. The first date was perfect, right? Told you she could see something special with you. I stared at her, stunned. How did you? Because that's her script, Ariel said simply. Same one she used on the last three guys. Did she cry about her ex ruining her ability to trust? Ariel's words hit something deep. Eight months of I need more time to figure out what I want. Eight months of being introduced as just my name. Eight months of watching her keep her options open while I closed mine completely. Last month, when I brought up being exclusive again, she cried, said I was pressuring her, that she thought we were perfect how we were. I'd apologized. Apologize? For wanting to be her boyfriend officially. You decorated this whole place, didn't you? Ariel said, looking at the rose gold theme. I spent hours perfecting because I knew it was her favorite. Her friends told me you coordinated everything, even drove to three different stores to find those specific balloons. I nodded, watching her show some guy her tinder matches while laughing with her cousin. She deleted tinder, right? Ariel asked. Of. Of course not, I said. She needs it for networking. You know what's crazy? Ariel continued. In all our calls, she's never once called you her boyfriend. But she loses it when you don't text. Back fast enough. The truth of it stung. Just last week, she'd shown up at my apartment at 2:00am, crying because I'd fallen asleep and missed her calls, convinced I was with someone else. Ariel moved closer, her voice dropping. I came here to visit her, but really, I wanted to meet you. She talks about you constantly, but only when she's worried you might leave. It's always Harry might be seeing someone else. Or Harry didn't heart my message. Across the room, I saw her notice us talking. She immediately stopped mid conversation with her cousin. I'm tired of games, Ariel said suddenly. I'm 28. I want something real. Someone who shows up, who puts in effort, who doesn't need

Now they want me to fund their retirement. So my parents had been saving money for all three of us kids to go to college since we were babies. My older brother and sister both used theirs, went to the local state school, lived at home, worked part time jobs at target, in the mall for spending money. I'm the youngest, and I was different. While they were partying in high school, I was grinding. 4.0 GPA, valedictorian, captain of the debate team, studying every single night because I had bigger dreams than staying local. Senior year, I got a full ride scholarship to one of the top engineering programs in the country. Full tuition, room and board, everything covered. When I asked my parents if I could use my college fund for other stuff, maybe a car or to help with living expenses, they called a family meeting. They sat me down at the kitchen table with this whole serious lecture. The money was specifically saved for education expenses. Since your scholarship covers everything and you don't actually need it, we're not legally obligated to give it to you. It wouldn't be fair to your brother and sister who had to work part time jobs during school. I tried explaining that I'd worked way harder than either of them, that I'd sacrificed my entire social life, that I was saving them literally tens of thousands of dollars they'd plan to spend. My dad Just shook his head and said, that's not how this works. Two months later, they used my college money, the money they've been telling me was mine my whole life, to completely renovate their kitchen and take the whole family to Disney World. When I said I wouldn't be joining them on the vacation, my mom said I was being ungrateful and dramatic. Fine. The day after graduation, I moved out. My uncle got me a job as a welder's helper on a pipeline crew. These were hardcore blue collar guys making serious money in brutal auditions. They all thought I was insane to give up that kind of cash to go sit in classrooms. But I showed up every day at 5:00am, worked in 100 degree heat, got my hands destroyed, came home exhausted. The welder I was paired with actually gave me a two thousand dollar bonus at the end of summer because he'd expect I did me to quit after three days. But I stuck it out. Did that same routine for three summers straight. School year, perfect grades, great professors, amazing friends. Summer back with the pipeline crew, banking every dollar while my siblings were doing internships at coffee shops. I was making more than most adults. Got a co op position my senior year that LED to a job offer. Graduated with zero debt. Started traveling the world for work. Been doing it for 10 years now. No wife, no kids. Just building my career. And saving money like crazy. Then last month, I get this call from my dad. Hey, buddy. Your mom and I are thinking about retiring early. We know you're doing really well financially, and we were hoping you could help us out a little bit. I asked how much my brother and sister were contributing to their retirement fund. Long pause. Well, you know, they both have families now. Kids are expensive. They really can't afford to help out right now. I couldn't help but smile. Dad. That's

I smiled. Like the movie with Katniss Everdeen? No, silly. It's when we see who cries first from being hungry. I never lose anymore, but Millie still does. Her little sister, maybe five, was sitting in the corner, clutching her stomach. How long do you play play this game? I asked, keeping my voice light. My record is three days. Ava beamed with pride. Daddy marks it on the fridge chart. Millie only made it one day before she cried like a baby. My assistant, Jackie, shot me a glance. That's when I noticed how Ava's dress hung loose on her frame. That's impressive, I said, trying to keep my voice steady. Do you play this game a lot? Every week. Sometimes twice. If we've been bad, like when I forgot to clean my room, I had to play for four days. Four days is a really long time without food, I said, watching her stuff crackers in her pockets. What happens when someone loses? We have to wait longer. Daddy says only we kids need food every day. Millie whimpered from her corner. My tummy hurts all the time. Ava whipped around. Shut up! What's wrong with you? You'll lose. Do you want to wait another week? My hands stilled on the book I was preparing to read. That seems like a long time for the game. Not really. Theo Went nine days once, but then he fainted at school. The nurse got all weird about it. Now he's not allowed to play anymore. She said it was pity for Theo. Theo's your brother? Foster brother. He went to live somewhere else. Daddy said he was too weak for our family. Ava, when did you eat last? I asked casually, like we were discussing the weather. She counted on her fingers. Tuesday. Daddy says I'm getting stronger. It was Saturday. This child hadn't eaten in four days and was out of it. I noticed Millie's hair was thin, patchy in places. Her arms looked like twigs. And what about breakfast or snacks? I prompted gently. Oh, no, that's cheating. When we play The Hunger Game, it's nothing at all. Not even milk. Water is okay, though. Daddy's not mean. The way she said it, like allowing water made him generous, sent ice through my veins. Well, it's story time. Everyone eats, I said firmly, pushing the entire snack tray toward them. Different rules here. While the other children arrived, I watched Ava carefully portion out food to her sister, whispering, eat slow so you don't throw up. My stomach turned. They've done this before. Ava, I said quietly, during snack time, does your mommy play the Hunger Game, too? Sometimes, but she cheats. I caught her eating crackers in the bathroom once. Daddy made her play for a whole week after that. She kept crying and saying she was sorry. But rules are rules. I excused myself to get more supplies and called CPS for my office. I have two children here showing clear signs of systematic starvation, I whispered urgently. The older one hasn't eaten in four days and thinks it's a game. Back in the story room, I sat close to the girls during reading time. Ava leaned against me and I could feel her ribs through her dress. Do you play other games at home? I asked. During craft time, the strong game, Millie piped up. We stand with our arms up until someone drops them. Ava nodded. I lasted two hours yesterday. Daddy says we're building character. She showed me the underside of her arms. Bruises lined them where blood had pooled. Sometimes we play the quiet game in the cold shower. If you make noise, you stay.

My dad missed my graduation for a job interview. Mom promised he'd make it, but kept checking her phone anxiously during the entire ceremony. I felt my heart sink when I scanned the crowd and didn't see his face anywhere. After walking across that stage, I gripped my phone, waiting for something. No texts, no calls. Complete silence. Mom couldn't look me in the eyes. When I found her afterward, she hugged me way too tight and whispered, he really tried, sweetheart. My chest burned with anger. I couldn't hide anymore. At my graduation party, relatives kept asking about dad. Mom cycled through increasingly desperate excuses. Traffic jam, work emergency, car trouble, each lie more pathetic than the last. I watched her stumble through explanations while my shame grew deeper. My friend Jake pulled me aside and asked, you doing okay, man? I just laughed and said, he's been doing this since I was 7 years old, because it was absolutely true. He missed my championship basketball game where I scored the winning shot. Missed my debate team finals when I took first place. Even missed my 18th birthday party last year. Said he had to work late again that night. After everyone finally left, I sat alone staring at my diploma. Mom tried approaching me, but I cut her off immediately. I said, grabbing my car keys, I've heard every excuse before. I drove to my old elementary school playground and sat on the Same swing where dad used to push me before work completely consumed his life. Before he became just a distant voice sometimes heard. Coming home at 2:00am, something inside me finally broke that night. All the anger I'd bottled up for years spilled over at once. I pulled out my phone and texted him. Congratulations on showing me exactly where I rank in your priorities. Message delivered. Read immediately. When I got home after midnight, Dad's car was sitting in our driveway. I found him hunched over our kitchen table. Head.

I was six beers deep at the hotel bar when Alan put $300 on the counter. Bet you can't give a toast at that wedding next door. We could hear the DJ through the wall asking for speakers. My girlfriend had just dumped me over text for never taking risks or putting myself out there. I've been telling my friends all night that I could charm anyone and Alan decided to test me. The guys all leaned in to see if I'd take the bet. The reception was at that point where they open the mic to anyone who wants to speak. My drunk plan was simple. I pretend to work with the groom and give a generic business guy speech. Rob told me dedication and commitment were perfect wedding words. The ballroom doors were open and people were walking freely between spaces. My shirt was wrinkled, but the lights were dim enough to hide it. I walked in from the hotel bar and when the DJ saw me approaching the microphone, he looked relieved that someone finally volunteered. I grabbed the microphone and a champagne glass from a passing waiter and told everyone I needed a moment outside because big moments get to me. While people smiled and nodded and the bride sat up to listen, I started with safe stuff about knowing the groom from work and watching him grow as a professional before pointing at the bride and saying this. Guy talks about you the way he talks about his biggest wins. Everyone laughed while the groom mouth thank you from his table with tears forming in his eyes. I kept going with generic lines about late nights at the office paying off. Remember those long nights when everything seemed impossible, I said, getting nods from everyone who'd ever worked late. Well, now you found someone worth losing sleep for. My voice cracked when I mentioned what makes a good partnership because that's what my ex said I couldn't do. But I pushed through and finished by saying they deserved all the happiness in the world. The room exploded with applause and the groom caught me in a huge hug saying it meant everything. Probably too emotional and drunk to wonder why he didn't remember me. And that's when Natalie walked up with dark hair and a smile that made me forget why I was there. She pressed a napkin with her purple penned number into my hand while saying, I work for the wedding planner and I've never heard such a beautiful toast from a business guy. And we ended up dancing for a few songs while my friends watched from the doorway in shock. During our last dance, Natalie asked, coffee sometime right in my ear and I said yes immediately. When my friends texted that the hotel bar was closing, she squeezed my hand making me promise to call before I left feeling better than I had In weeks, two weeks later, the bride tried to send me a thank you card but couldn't figure out who I was. The wedding planner pulled security footage and saw me walking in from the public bar and grabbing a glass from their reception waiter. The hotel banned me using my credit card information from the bar tab. That night, Natalie texted the planner.

Growing up, my parents had a unique approach to settling sibling disputes that I assumed was universal until college roommate conversations proved otherwise. Whenever my sister and I fought over something, a toy, TV choice, front seat privileges, my parents would immediately implement what they called the auction. They'd take whatever we were fighting about and announce bidding starts at 10 minutes. This meant we had to bid chore time to win the disputed item. My sister might open with 15 minutes of dishes, which I'd counter with 20 minutes of yard work. The bidding continued until one of us dropped out, unwilling to commit more chore time. The winner got the coveted item. The loser did nothing. But the winner had to complete their bid in short time before enjoying their prize. The genius part, if our parents suspected we were fighting just to get attention, they'd add auction minimums, starting bids of 30+ minutes. That made us quickly decide if the argument was actually worth it. By age 10, my sister and I had developed complex economic analyses of whether conflicts were worth the chore cost. We'd negotiate privately before even involving our parents because we understood the true price of disagreement. In college, I mentioned the auction to my roommates during a dispute over parking spaces. They stared at me like I'd suggested we solve it through ritual combat. That's when I realised most families don't run their homes like micro economic systems, teaching cost benefit analysis. As an adult, I recognise how brilliant it was. My parents never had to determine who was right. They simply created a system where we assigned our own value to our desires and paid accordingly. My sister and I rarely fight as adults. Everything seems negotiable after growing up with the auction.

Hi, everyone, I'm Sarah Miller, and my daughter Tiffany just transferred here today. The chat lit up with a string of welcomes and hellos. Just as I was about to type out my own greeting, a huge block of text appeared. Important notice from Tiffany's mom. Girls in the class, please take note. Starting next week, I'll be posting a picture of what my daughter is wearing each day. Please make sure your child doesn't wear the same thing. Also, I request that everyone please switch to the same brand of laundry detergent we use. My daughter has a very sensitive nose and can't tolerate other scents. Finally, my daughter was a C section baby and is a bit timid, so I ask you to tell your children not to bully her and make sure she's always treated with priority. Wow. I couldn't help but think, this isn't just a new student. This is a royal princess who's slumming it with us commoners. Some of the moms in the chat were quick to push back. Karen's mom are you serious? What my kid wears is none of your business. Why should we have to cater to you? Jessica's mom exactly! And we're supposed to all use your detergent? My son has allergies, too, and we use specific stuff. Yeah, who made your kid the queen of the class? My kid is special too. The Chat quickly devolved into a debate. Usually I just chuckled at the ridiculous things these parents said in the group chat. The class teacher was the administrator, and she'd usually step in to calm things down. I didn't see a problem, so I just muted the chat to get some work done. Then I got a DM. It was from Alyssa, whose daughter Emily was friends with Lily. Hey, Sarah, you got it.

Yeah, he bought it from some guy on Craigslist about 3 months ago, but I'm the one who drives it mostly now, since I just got my license. The mechanic wiped his hands on a rag and walked me around to the front of my Subaru Legacy, while my dad waited in the shop's lobby, scrolling through his phone, probably answering work emails. We'd brought the car in for a simple oil change, but the mechanic had been under there for way longer than normal, and now his face looked like someone had died. He popped the hood and pointed a flashlight at something underneath that I couldn't really see from where I was standing, but his hand was trembling. You need to get your dad over here right now. And nobody drives this car again until we fix this. His voice was steady, but there was something in his eyes that made my stomach drop, like when you miss a step going downstairs. Someone wanted you dead, and they almost succeeded. Another day or two of driving this thing and you wouldn't be standing here. What's wrong with it? I asked. Well, texting my dad to come outside immediately, but the mechanic was already taking pictures with his phone and muttering about calling the police, which made no sense for a car repair. My dad pushed through the door, looking annoyed because he'd Been in the middle of a work hall. But his expression changed when he saw the mechanic's face. The mechanic grabbed a trouble light and aimed it at the brake lines near the master cylinder, showing us cuts that went almost all the way through the metal. These were sliced to leak slowly over weeks, so when they finally failed, it would look like a magic accident that nobody would question. He moved the light to show three different cut points, all at calculated angles that would have failed simultaneously. Professional job. But they made one mistake. They used a specific cutting pattern I've only seen once before. My dad's face went white as he stared at the sabotaged brake lines. And I remembered last week when I'd slammed the brakes to avoid a dog and felt them go completely soft for a terrifying second before catching. The mechanic kept staring at the cuts like they were a signature, and then walked to the car's rear bumper, where there was a faded church sticker. Was there a Saint medallion hanging from the rearview mirror when you bought it? My dad nodded slowly, and the mechanic's hands started shaking worse as he stepped back from the car. This belonged to my sister Nina, and that cutting pattern is exactly how her husband Greg showed me to slice fishing line when we went deep sea fishing last year. He pulled out his phone and started scrolling through photos until he found one Of this exact car in a driveway with the same dent in the passenger door. She sold it without telling him because she was leaving him after he put her in the hospital twice, but he must have thought she still had it. The and it called someone, and I heard him say frantically, Nina, you need to get out of that apartment right now. Greg knows where you are, and he already tried to kill you once. My dad called 9 1 1, while the mechanic stayed on with his sister, telling her to pack nothing and just drive to the police station immediately. The officers arrived fast, with their lights flashing, and treated our car like an attempted murder scene, while the mechanic explained that Greg had been escalating his violence, and had told multiple people at their church that if he couldn't have Nina, nobody would, especially not some other man. The detective examined the brake lines with gloved hands and confirmed this was designed to fail catastrophically at high speed, probably while going downhill or merging onto the highway. The way these are cut, you'd have about two seconds of pumping the pedal before total brake failure, at which point most people would already be in a fatal collision. He looked at me and asked if I'd noticed anything unusual.

Megan grabbed my arm while we were shopping for jeans and whispered, don't turn around. But is that guy following us? I glanced over my shoulder and saw a man in a gray hoodie looking at his phone that was angled toward us. We noticed him earlier in the food court, then again at Sephora. We decided to test it and left, suddenly walking toward Forever 21. And there he was at the escalator. Now my heart was racing. Megan said we should go to security, but I felt stupid because what would we say? That some guy was shopping in the same stores? We couldn't see his face clearly under the hood, and he wasn't doing anything obviously threatening, just existing near us. We ducked into the crowded store and wove through racks of clothes trying to lose him. I saw him enter and stop near the entrance, scanning the store systematically row by row. We crouched behind a display and Megan whispered, why would someone follow us? What if he's some creep who saw us and just decided we were easy targets? That my skin crawl. We waited until he moved deeper into the store, then slipped out the side entrance. We speed walked toward the department store, figuring we could cut through to the parking garage. My hands were shaking as I texted my roommate where we were just in case something happened. We made it To the department store and started weaving through the makeup counters, past the jewelry, toward the back exit. I was starting to breathe normally again when Megan froze. He was there again, coming through the main entrance, moving faster now, like he knew we spotted him and didn't care about being subtle anymore. We ran toward the back exit, and I could hear footsteps behind us, not running, but walking fast, steady, deliberate, like he we couldn't really escape. An employee asked if we needed help, and I wanted to scream yes, but Megan pulled me along, saying, the exits right there. We burst into the parking garage, and the temperature dropped instantly. Cold concrete and shadows everywhere. Ran toward where I parked on level 3. I fumbled for my keys while we ran, my hands shaking so bad I dropped them and they skittered across the concrete. Megan grabbed them and we reached my car in a dark corner where I parked that morning. She clicked the unlock button, but nothing happened. She tried again, pressing it desperately, but still nothing. The battery in the key FOB must have died. I grabbed the keys to manually unlock it, but my hands were shaking too much to get the key in the lock. That's when we heard the garage door slam open behind us, the sound echoing off every surface. He was coming, walking straight towards us with purpose. I finally got the key in, but it wouldn't turn like The lock was jammed or frozen from sitting all. Megan was pulling on the door handle frantically, saying, come on, come on, come on. He was getting closer, steady footsteps echoing off concrete. And now he was speeding up, almost jogging. I was fighting with the key, trying to force it, and it finally turned, but the door wouldn't open. Something was wrong with it, stuck or broken. He was 20 feet away now, and I saw him reach into his jacket pocket, pulling something out that glinted. Megan turned to faith

So I said, try me. My girlfriend Irene had this theory about me and my best friend Lance. She brought it up during game night at our place when she'd had too much wine. You know what's funny, Jonah? She said with a nasty smile. You're so pathetic, I could literally f lance in our bed. And you'd probably apologize to him for being in the way. Everyone went quiet. Lance's fiance, Marina, looked double. I told her to stop being weird. I'm serious, Irene continued, as if she hadn't just said something insane. You're so scared of confrontation, you'd rather lose your best friend than admit your girlfriend crossed the line. Lance tried to change the subject, but Irene kept going. I could probably seduce him right in front of you and you'd find a way to blame him for it. Men always blame each other. Never the woman. I set down my cards and look at her. That's sick, Irene, she laughed. But it's true. You're too weak to stop me and too pathetic to leave me. Marina said we should call it a night. As everyone left, Irene whispered, I could prove at any time. I said, go ahead. Try. The next few weeks, Irene started testing boundaries. She'd text Lance about random things, always screenshotting his polite responses to show me. See how quick he answers. She'd say she Started dressing differently when we hung out with them. Touching Lance's arm when she laughed, sitting too close on the couch. Marina noticed, Lance noticed, everyone noticed. But nobody said anything because. What do you say? That's when I texted Lance privately, told him I had enough with everything he was saying. He was also really pissed. Marina was furious that she hadn't stopped. They wanted to confront her immediately, but I had a different idea. Let her try whatever she was planning, but be ready. Document everything. Show everyone who she really was. Then Lance announced his birthday party plans. Just close friends at his and Marina's apartment. Irene immediately said, perfect. Maybe I'll give him a special present. She spent two hours getting ready, wearing a dress I'd never seen before. At the party, she started drinking immediately, working her way closer to Lance with each drink. I watched her watch me, making sure I saw every move. She'd touch his chest, look at me, laugh at his jokes, look at me. Around 10 p m, she made her move. Lance went to his bedroom to grab his jacket for Marina, who was cold. Irene followed him, giving me one last smirk before disappearing down the hallway. Marina had excused herself. Five and it's earlier. Hiding in their walk in closet with her phone ready. I stayed in the living room, listening. Irene's voice carried through the walls. Marina doesn't have to know. Jonah is too weak to Do anything anyway, he'll blame you, not me. That's what weak men do. Lance's voice came next. Irene! Get off me! What are you doing, then? Louder! I said stop! This is assault!

I always thought my older brother Kyle was just a tech geek. He spent hours in our garage working on what he called projects, building computers, fixing phones, that kind of stuff. Mom and dad were proud of his skills. He was 19 and I was 12, so I mostly stayed out of his way. But something felt off about Kyle. He always seemed to know things he shouldn't. Like when I told my friend Jake a secret over the phone in my room, Kyle would make weird comments about it the next day. Or when my sister Emma practiced her dance routines alone, he tease her about specific moves she'd messed up. At first, I thought he was just good at guessing. Everything changed on a Tuesday after school. I was looking for my phone charger and decided to check the air vent above my bed where I sometimes hid stuff. That's when I felt something that didn't belong. A tiny black camera no bigger than a quarter stuck to the inside of the vent with electrical tape. My hands were shaking as I pulled it out. There were thin wires running from it that disappeared deeper into the ductwork. Followed the wires outside to where they LED straight into Kyle's garage workshop. That night, I waited until Kyle went to his friend's house. I snuck into the garage and nearly threw up at what I found. Three computer Monitors sat on his workbench, each showing live video feeds. One showed my room. Another showed Emma's room. The third showed the hallway right outside our bathroom. I watched myself sleeping from the night before on one of the recorded files. Kyle had been watching me for who knows how long. Next morning, I cornered Kyle in the kitchen while mom was getting ready for work. I found your cameras, I said, trying to keep my voice steady. Kyle didn't even look surprised. He just grinned and kept eating his cereal. Don't be so dramatic, Liam. It's just for fun. I like knowing what's going on around here. You're spying on us. That's sick. It's not spying if it's my own house, he said, laughing. Besides, what are you gonna do about it? I told mom and dad. That afternoon, Kyle spun some story.

Gonzalez smiled sweetly. I just want our family to be safe, he said, hiding behind my parents backs as he mouth goodbye. Fine.

Next, he discovered online chemistry tutorials without me. Secretly replacing his chemicals with baking soda, he created what he called rainbow smoke bombs in the kitchen. But they were actually just straight up acid that ate through the tiles and corrupted all the food. Hazmat had to gut our kitchen entirely. Total cost $8,000. Why didn't you tell us this would happen? Mom yelled at me through the phone. I did. You just never listened. I reminded her. Then Gonzales revealed he'd been training squirrels in the attic. They're my army, he explained, as 20 squirrels wearing tiny tin foil hats ended through the ceiling during Dad's Zoom meeting with his boss. Dad got fired on the spot. Then came the car improvement incident. Gonzalez filled Dad's gas tank with what he called Super Juice, a mixture of energy drinks, lighter fluid, and glitter. The car made it exactly 12 feet before the engine shot through the hood like a rocket landing in our neighbor's pool. The neighbors

Savannah had been stealing my moment since we were kids. At my 10th birthday, she blew out my candles to help me. At my high school graduation, she wore white and told everyone we were both graduating, even though she was a sophomore. At my engagement dinner, she spent the night telling Nathan's family how she introduced us, even though they met at work. The cancer diagnosis was just another moment for her to steal. Two days after my diagnosis, Savannah moved into our house without asking. She made a Caringbridge page but wrote everything from her perspective. Every post started with how hard it was for her to watch me suffer. Friends praised her dedication while I spent hours throwing up from chemo. Three weeks in, I asked if Nathan could drive me to appointment. Sometimes she started crying and said I was pushing her away during the hardest time of her life. She posted about how sick people lash out at caregivers. Nathan said I should apologize. By month 2, she reorganized our entire house. I moved Nathan's things to the guest room and started screaming my calls. She turned away visitors, saying stress would hurt my recovery. She joined Nathan for evening runs to discuss my care. They'd come back sweaty and avoid eye contact. Four months into treatment, my white count dropped and the nurse sent me home. Early, I took an Uber because Savannah had our car for shopping. I heard voices from our bedroom and climbed the stairs slowly. When I opened the door, they were in my bed. Savannah was wearing the anniversary pajamas Nathan bought me. She jumped up wearing my robe and rushed over with fake concern. She asked why I was home early and said I must be confused from the medications. She. I actually told Nathan to call my nurse about hallucinations. He just sat there in his boxers while she performed. My legs gave out. I slid down the door frame, realizing she'd stolen my husband while I was fighting cancer. Nathan finally said, I've been distant and Savannah understood his stress better. He compared his stress to my cancer. They moved out next week. Savannah told everyone I'd become paranoid from treatment. She posted about watching loved ones lose themselves to illness. People praised her for setting boundaries. Most friends believed her. I finished three months of treatment alone. No one cheered when I rang the bell. I recorded it myself but deleted it that night on my bathroom floor. I decided Savannah had stolen from me my whole life. This time would be different. During recovery, I studied Savannah's patterns like I was planning a battle. I made fake social media accounts to track her posts and learn her routines. Found out she had joined a fancy yoga studio and was flirting with her married instructor. She worked At a marketing firm downtown and volunteered for their charity events. She and Nathan had rented a condo near the river. I mapped out her entire life and looked for weak spots. Joined her yoga studio but went to different class times. I became friends with the instructor's wife at the juice bar next door. We bonded over books and recovery stories without me mentioning Savannah. When Savannah started asking for private sessions, his wife was already suspicious. She found their text messages and confronted Savannah in the packed studio lobby. She read every flirty message out loud. While Savannah tried to cry her way out, the entire studio turned against her. Next, I joined the board of her company's charity foundation as a cancer survivor advocate. At their annual gala, I gave a speech about finding strength during treatment. I started by describing the loneliness of chemo and how cancer strips away.

I was 9 when my mom left me at Walmart, not by accident. She literally told me to sit on the bench by the entrance and wait while she went to get stuff from her car. I waited three hours. A store worker named Beth found me there when the sun was going down. She had this worried look and asked where my parents were. I told her my mom said she'd be right back. Beth called security, then the cops. Mom showed up 20 minutes after the police arrived. No panic, no tears, just annoyed that I made a scene. She told the officer she forgot I was there because she had errands to run, like I was a grocery bag she left behind. Cop looked at her weird and asked how you forget your kid. Mom just shrugged and said kids are supposed to stay where you put them. That wasn't even the worst part. Two weeks later, she did it again at the mall. This time I waited four hours until mall security found me asleep on a food court chair. When mom finally came back, she was carrying shopping bags from stores that weren't even in that mall. She'd literally gone somewhere else entirely. The security guy was pissed. He asked if this happened before and I told him about Walmart. His face went red and he made my mom sit there while he called someone. I don't know who, but afterward, mom was really quiet on the drive home. At home, dad was watching t. V. Like nothing happened. When I told him what happened, he just said, your mother's got a lot on her mind. Like that explained leaving your kid places. Third time I was ready. We went to target and mom pulled the same move, but this time I followed her to the parking lot and watched her drive away. I went back inside and found the customer service desk myself. The lady there was super nice. Her name was Carol and she gave me a juice box while we waited. When mom came back, two hours.

Every August for like six years, I host this huge end of summer party in my backyard. It's basically become the neighborhood event that everyone looks forward to. Kids run around screaming with popsicles. Parents drink beer and complain about going back to school shopping. And by 9:00, the little ones are dragged inside to sleep while the adults keep the party going until like midnight. My house is literally right next to the backyard, so when my kids, Mia and Tyler, get tired, I just take them upstairs, tuck them in and leave the bedroom window open so I can hear everything going on outside. They have my old iPhone, too, so if anything happens, they can just text me. It's worked perfectly for years. This year, I invited my boyfriend, Kevin, and his two kids, Emma and Jake. We've been together for 6 months, which felt like long enough to include them in my tradition. But when I explained how the night usually goes, Kevin's face got all weird. He said he wasn't comfortable with his kids sleeping at my place since they'd never stayed over before. Okay, fair enough. Then he said he didn't like the idea of putting them to bed while he stayed outside with me. didn't want to leave early with them while I stayed at my own party. Basically, nothing about my setup worked for him. Told him I totally understood and that they didn't have to come. Like this isn't some random hangout I threw together last minute. This is an annual thing with a format that works for everyone who's been coming for years. If it doesn't work for you, then don't come. No big deal. But Kevin lost his mind, started saying that he and his kids weren't actually welcome because of how I set everything up, that I should have changed the whole party just for them, that any good girlfriend would leave her own party early to put his kids to bed and stay with them. The party happened without them. It was actually amazing. Missus Chen from next door brought her famous potato salad. The Henderson kids had a water balloon fight that soaked half the adults. And Around 10:30, when all the kids were asleep, we played music and talked until almost 1 in the morning. I didn't think about Kevin once until my phone started buzzing. He'd been texting me all night asking why I wasn't calling him, said I should have made time during my own party to check in with him, that he felt left out and ignored. I saw the messages when I was cleaning up and just put my phone away. The next day he came over and we had this massive fight. He kept saying I chose my neighbors over him and his kids, that I prioritized some stupid tradition over our relationship. That if I really cared about him, I would have either changed the party format or left early to spend time with them. I, I told him that was insane. This party happens one night a year. Everyone knows the deal. His kids would have had fun until bedtime and then they could have gone home or figured something else out. But changing a six year tradition for someone I've been dating for six months, making all my neighbours adapt to his comfort level, leaving my own party early, not happening. He said I was selfish and not ready for a real relationship with someone who has kids. But I clearly wasn't thinking long term about us if I wasn't willing to make adjustments. I said maybe he was right because someone who expected me to completely rearrange my life after six months probably wasn't someone I wanted to think long term about anyway. We broke up. Two days later, he sent me this long text about how I'd realise what I lost when I was alone at next year's party.

My son turned eight last Saturday and his mom threw him this huge party at her parents house with bouncy castles and a magician, probably 50 people there. I showed up with my gift wrapped in newspaper because I couldn't afford wrapping paper. And my ex wife's sister actually laughed out loud when she saw it. Her husband pulled me aside and said I should be embarrassed showing my face here when everyone knows I'm three months behind on child support and asked if I even knew what grade he was in. I wanted to tell him that I actually knew his teacher personally because I've been volunteering at his school every lunch hour. But instead I just stood there and took it because arguing would just make everything worse for my boy. The whole party was basically two hours of my ex wife's family taking turns humiliating me while I tried to stay invisible near the fence. Her mom kept making these loud comments about how some fathers actually provide for their children. And her dad walked past me carrying my son's new bike and said maybe someday I could afford to buy my child something that didn't come from a thrift store. When they brought out the cake and my son wanted me to stand next to him for photos, his grandmother literally stepped in front of me and said they wanted pictures with people who were actually Part of his life. I watched my boy's face fall and it took everything in me not to say something, but I knew they'd just use it against me. Court, my ex wife's aunt asked me directly in front of everyone if I was still working that pathetic warehouse job or if I've been fired from that too. And when I said I was still there, she said at least my son would learn what not to become. My ex wife stood there telling her cousins that I lived in some disgusting studio apartment and probably spent my child support money on beer while her sister nodded along and said some people just aren't meant to be fathers and that's okay. That's when a Grace Dan pulled up and this exhausted looking woman got out carrying a thick folder and walking straight through the party toward me like everyone else was invisible. She looked distressed and said she was sorry but this couldn't wait another day because the state was threatening to pull the placement if she didn't get the inspection done immediately. My ex wife's mom immediately stepped forward and demanded to know who this woman was and what the hell she was talking about. The woman said she was from Child Protective Services and she needed to inspect my home for the foster placement renewal and verify the twins were still thriving. My ex wife's sister went completely white and whispered, what twins? The social worker flipped through Her papers and said she was talk.

My older sister is super jumpy. Like, she gets scared if the toast pops up too loud. So when I found out she'd been watching creepy sleepwalking videos all week, I saw my golden opportunity. One night, I stayed up late and waited until I knew she was asleep. Then I slowly opened her bedroom door, walked in barefoot with my eyes half closed, and started mumbling random garbage like, the bees are listening. They can smell light. She's full panic. I pretended to snap out of it like I didn't know what was going on. And the next morning, I told her I had no memory of it. That's what really got her. She was convinced I was actually sleepwalking. So I did it again the next night. This time, I stood at the end of her bed holding a spoon and just. I am the cereal. I was holding myself from bursting out laughing. After that, she started locking her door, so I got creative. I'd rattle the doorknob or just whisper her name through the air vent until she freaked out. I kept telling her I didn't remember any of it. My acting was elite. She even started filming me to prove it was real. But I would just delete the videos when she wasn't looking. It became this little war. Honestly, it was the most fun I'd had in weeks. I never meant to actually Scare her. Just mess with her a little. But then one night, she ran into my room looking pale and said, I need to show you something right now. I followed her down the hall, thinking it was just another one of her over reactions. she opened her phone and pulled up a video from the night before. The footage showed her room in the dark and a figure slowly pushing the door open. Me? Or someone that looked like me. I watched the figure step into her room, stand completely still for a full minute, then start whispering. But it wasn't gibberish this time. It was my name. Over and over, whispered slowly, almost like. Then it tilted its head and said, I know you're awake. That's when the video cut out. I tried to laugh it off and said, okay, I admit it. That one was actually kind of good. But she didn't laugh. She looked at me and said, that wasn't from last night. That was from the night you slept over at Sam's house. My stomach dropped. I'd spent that night two neighborhoods over, crashing on my friend's couch. I pulled out my own phone to double check the text. There it was. A message from me at 11:08 saying, crashing here tonight. Tell mom that video was recorded at 203:00am. I stared at the screen and tried to find some logical explanation. Maybe someone was messing with us. Maybe she faked the whole Thing. But then she said, I didn't want to tell you, but a few nights ago, I saw you standing in the hallway. I called your name and you didn't answer. You just walked into the bathroom and never came out. When I checked a minute later, the light was off and the room was empty. That was the part I couldn't explain, because I remembered.

When the doctor told me surgery or death, and my boyfriend drew told me to start digging my own grave. However, he'd soon come to regret it. I was sitting in the office after finally going in for the stomach pain I've been ignoring for months. This could have been prevented if caught earlier, he said, looking at my chart. When was your last checkup? Four years ago. I couldn't afford it. I have insurance, but I needed every penny for rent, bills, my boyfriend's art studio. The doctor frowned, tapping on a clipboard. I see. Well, the surgery will cost about $5,000 with your coverage. 5,000? I felt the air get knocked out from my lungs. Maybe next time, doctor. I can still handle it. He gave a worried look before signing the release papers. But three steps from the hospital door, I felt a sharp pain zapped through me. I dropped to my knees on the asphalt and coughed up blood. The security guard radioed for help, and they rushed me back on a stretcher. You're bleeding internally. If we don't operate soon, this could rupture. I frowned and gave them Drew's contact. Think he'd understand? Just this once? The nurse stayed with me while they prepped more paperwork. So you handle all the bills? She asked with a disgusted expression, after I'd explained our situation. Well, when drew makes it big, it'll All come back like an investment. The nurse couldn't help but roll her eyes at my answer. And how long has he been not making it big? Six years. And how many of these artworks has he sold? Nothing yet, but he's close to a breakthrough. His mentor says he has talent, but I think this time I might have overdone it. I work 60 hours a week, two jobs. I haven't bought new clothes in three years. I'd love to go to a salon one last time before, you know, I pass away, I said bleakly, laughing at my own terrible situation. You need to take care of yourself too, honey. She touched my hand gently. What does your partner contribute exactly? I opened my mouth and closed it. He contributes. He's following his passion. I'd like to show him my passion. My passionate fists, she mumbled to herself and smiled. All right, you rest up. She left the room, still clearly upset at my story, but it felt nice having someone worry about me for once. Drew arrived two hours later, looking annoyed. This is really bad timing. I have a studio session with my mentor. The doctor explained the situation again. The urgency, the cost. Drew's face lit up. Actually, this is perfect timing. What? I asked, shocked at his happy tone. We have exactly 5,000 saved, right? Well, my mentor knows a gallery owner, and I can finally book my first show. I stared at him. From the hospital bed. But that money is for my surgery. Yeah, but we could get a loan for that, right? This is my one shot, drew. I'm dying. He looked at me with a raised eyebrow and an expression that screamed, so what? I snapped. No, I said calmly. What do you mean, no? The heart monitor slowly started rising. Six years, drew. I've paid for your life for six years. And now when I plan on choosing myself for once, you tell me not to. But it's not just a gallery. It's my dream. I tried to fight back my tears, but couldn't hold them. Your dream over my life. All this time, I've just been some sponsor to your dream. An open bank account. As working 60 hours is easy. It's not. I'm tired. So tired, drew. I said I'd pay it all back. He yelled. I laughed. When? Well, when? My art gallery. If you had to choose now, what would it be? My surgery or your gallery? Drew stood there with his mouth gaping open, acting as if it was a difficult question. I can't believe you're making me choose. That's, um, gaslighting. Choose. Drew paced back and forth nervously. This isn't fair. My mentor said this gallery could really change everything for me. Uh, for us. I said, choose. I'll come check on you after my show. He took my wallet from my back and walked out. I sobbed.

Three years ago, when I first met my husband, Greg's mother, Mallory, she made her famous tuna casserole with crushed potato chips and mayonnaise that had definitely seen better days. The smell alone made my stomach turn. But she stood there watching me take that first bite with such hopeful eyes. I couldn't crush her heart like that. So I smiled, forced it down, and said it was delicious. That single moment of kindness became my prison. Now, three years into our marriage, edge, Mallory brings food over twice a week, always in those same vintage Tupperware containers she's had since the 70s. When she brings her surprise meatloaf that tastes like cardboard soaked in ketchup, I order meatloaf from the diner and carefully transfer it to her containers. I'm spending $200 a month just to maintain the charade. Things started unraveling two weeks ago when Mallory announced she was entering a cooking competition at the community center and wanted me to be her sous chef and taste tester. She's been coming over more frequently, sometimes unannounced, bringing practice dishes. Greg's been acting strange about it, too. Overly enthusiastic, constantly asking if I'm excited about spending more. I'm with his mother, watching me eat with this weird intensity. His eyes literally track every bite from fork to mouth, and he keeps asking, isn't it amazing? Don't you wish you could have this every day? My stomach Turns every time. Yesterday, he came home early and almost caught me transferring Thai food into Mallory's green bean casserole dish. I had to pretend I was just freshening up the presentation. My hands were shaking so badly, I nearly dropped the whole thing. He stood there for a full minute, just staring at me with a strange smile before saying, you really do love her cooking, don't you? But here's what's really odd. Greg's been having hushed phone conversations that end abruptly when I enter the room. Last week, I heard him say something about measuring the guest room and February move in date. When I asked about it, he said he was helping a coworker with furniture dimensions. He's also been weirdly insistent about us decluttering the spare bedroom, saying we need to make space. It's for new possibilities. Yesterday I found him in there with a tape measure and a notebook sketching what looked like furniture placement. When I walked in, he slammed the notebook shut and practically shoved me out, saying it was a surprise and I'd ruin everything if I kept snooping. Mallory's been dropping hints, too, asking about local doctors, the nearest grocery stores, whether our street gets loud quickly in winter. But if I ever tried to ask more questions, he'd shut me down instantly. Then one day, I woke up with food poisoning from this sketchy replacement Chinese food I had the day before and ran to the bathroom through the window. I saw Greg in the backyard on the phone, and his voice carry clearly in the morning. Quiet. Mom, I know you're excited about surprising her, but maybe we should tell her before my blood went cold. Tell me about what? He continued. I know I said February, but if you win this competition, it would be the perfect Celebration to announce your moving in. She loves your cooking so much. She'll be thrilled to have you here full time. Wait, moving in was my mother in law moving in, and my husband was just letting it happen? I stayed frozen, listening to him reassure his mother that I would definitely want her living with us, that I'm always saying how much I miss her between visits. The competition is tomorrow, and Mallory texted that she's bring

My coworker slides me $200 cash during lunch and whispers, I need you to be my boyfriend tomorrow. Just for four hours. It's my cousin's wedding. I almost choked on my sandwich. She's never talked to me about anything beyond spreadsheets and deadline complaints. Now she's offering me money to fake date her? She explains fast. Look, my whole family keeps asking why I'm still single. My mom calls every Sunday to remind me I'm 32 with no prospects. I just need someone normal to shut them up. Plus, you have that one good suit. The wedding's tomorrow at 2 p m. She promises another 200 after. You just have to hold my hand, laugh at my dad's jokes, and don't get too drunk. Easy money. Four hours of free food and pretending to like someone I already think is pretty cool. The cash would cover my car payment. Sure, why not? She looks relieved, like she was expecting me to say no, thank you. Seriously, you're saving my life here. Saturday morning, she picks me up in a BMW I didn't know she had. She's nervous, talking fast about the rules. We've been dating three months, met at work. That part's true. You love hiking. Because my mom will love that you went to State University. Don't mention your ex. Actually, don't mention any ex at all. She's gripping the steering wheel so tight, her knuckles Are white. Something's bothering her beyond normal. Fake date nerves. The venue is fancy. Way fancier than I expected. Valet parking, ice sculptures, a string quartet playing by the entrance. This isn't some backyard wedding. This is money. She grabs my hand really tight as we walk in, her palms sweating. Just stick close to me, okay? Some people here are complicated. We enter the cocktail area, and my chest tightens. I recognize faces in the crowd. This one guy by the bar is one of my ex's best friends, who always hosted those poker nights. This other guy is talking to someone near the fountain. He's my ex's friend from college who's always tagged with her in beach photos. Made me jealous every time. Then this girl walks by in a bridesmaid dress. She was my ex's roommate senior year. The one who told her I wasn't good enough. My stomach drops. These aren't random people. This is my ex's entire friend circle. Circle? Every person who watched our relationship explode. Hey, whose wedding is this exactly? I ask. She pulls me forward. My cousin Taylor's. Come on. Ceremony starting. Taylor. My ex's name is Taylor. We sit down in the fourth row. I'm scanning in the crowd, recognizing more faces. People who unfriended me after the breakup. I'm sweating through my good suit. Then the music starts. The wedding march. Everyone stands. The bride walks out. It's her. My ex. When I found in our bed with someone Else, two years ago. The one I was going to propose to. She's wearing the kind of dress she used to show me in magazines. My coworker squeezes my hand. You okay? You look pale. I can't speak. Can't move, can't breathe. Taylor looks beautiful, happy, glowing in a way she never did with me. The grooms, tall, everything. I'm not. After the ceremony, we're at cocktail hour. I'm Downing champagne like water, trying to stay calm. My coworker stays glued to my side, introducing me to aunts and uncles. This is my boyfriend. Three months now. He's wonderful playing the part, but dying inside. Then Taylor appears with the groom. Oh, my god, is that you? My coworker jumps in fast. Babe, you know the bride? Taylor's face cycles through emotions. Shock, confusion, something else. We. We dated years ago. Small world, my coworker says. Way too cheerful. We should get drinks sometime.

During a dinner celebrating us signing a lease on a brand new home, my wife dropped the bomb that she was quitting her job. I want to be a trad wife, she said out of the blue. I thought it was a joke until she pulled up her Instagram, where she had already made an extensive post about how amazing of a husband I was for agreeing to work two jobs to pay for the mortgage. The next morning, Katie quit her nursing job with no notice. By the end of the week, she'd gone full traditional. Wouldn't drive, wouldn't work, wouldn't make financial decisions. She also wouldn't answer the door for deliveries, claiming that was a man's job. So my expensive work equipment got stolen off our porch. she refused to sign for my certified mail from the IRS about a tax because traditional wives don't handle business matters. I got fined $8,000 for missing the deadline. Then my brother got into a severe car accident 40 minutes away. Single dad. His kids were at school and needed to be picked up. In two hours, he was unconscious and I was stuck in a mandatory meeting at work that I'd be fired for leaving. Katie, please, just this once, pick up the kids from school and drive them to the hospital. Traditional wives don't drive, she said, arranging flowers she picked from our garden. It's not feminine. They're 8 and 10 years old. They'll be standing outside school alone. Maybe their mother should have thought about that before divorcing your brother. My brother's kids waited outside their school until child services pick them up. The investigation lasted months. He nearly lost custody because of child abandonment while he was literally in a coma. I remember begging her to stop. She could be traditional and still use her frontal lobe, but nope, because two weeks later, our house caught fire. She was in the kitchen and left the stove on by accident. Extinguisher was literally in the corner next to her. But instead of grabbing it, she ran outside and called me. Traditional wives don't handle emergencies. That's the man's job. By the time firefighters arrived, half the kitchen was destroyed. 20,000 in damages. Insurance investigated why she didn't attempt to put out a containable fire, and our premiums tripled. That was when I finally snapped. You want traditional? Fine. She gleamed with excitement until I opened our banking app. I'm closing your access to our joint account. Her head snapped up. What? Traditional wives don't have their own bank accounts. They get allowances. My grandfather gave my grandmother $10 a week in 1960. Adjusted for inflation, that's $100 a month. That's insane. That's traditional. That evening, she was planning a Friday night out with the girls. Apparently, that's traditional. I'll need an Uber to downtown. Probably $30 each way. Traditional wives don't go to Bars without their husbands? That's inappropriate. It's just drinks with friends. My grandmother never went anywhere without my grandfather after six PM. Very traditional. She ended up canceling. Her father's 70th birthday was the next week, and her whole family had planned a surprise party for months. But when Saturday came, I had to work. I can't take you. I said, so you can't go. She had no car and missed it. Her father cried when he realized she wasn't coming. Her mother called her selfish. When Katie's grandmother was dying in hospice, Katie came to me crying, please, I need money for an Uber. Just this once. She's asking for me. Traditional wives don't handle money. I reminded her you said modern women's financial independence destroyed marriages. Remember your Instagram post? Her grandmother died a 30 minute drive away while Katie sat at home. Then her brother's wedding invitation arrived. Destination wedding in Mexico. Katie begged for her

I came into the emergency room clutching my abdomen. In the same hospital I once worked as chief of surgery. After two hours, I finally got to see Doctor Harm, who barely glanced up at me and sighed like I'd interrupted something by being here. Let me guess, he said before I could speak. You're 90 years old, ate dinner too late, and now you're panicking. On a scale of one to 10, how bad is your imaginary emergency? When I said eight, he actually laughed. Right. Everyone says eight. Real pain doesn't let you walk in here in your pajamas looking so put together. My pajamas were soaked with sweat from the pain. When did you last have your period? He asked with a smirk. When I said I was postmenopausal, he nodded like he'd solved everything. There you go. Hormones. They make women your age think every little cramp is a heart attack or appendicitis. You tried yoga? Maybe losing some weight? He typed something without examining me. I see a lot of hysterical women your age. Retirement gives you too much time to obsess over every little ache. I tried to explain that I knew my body, but he interrupted, ma'am, I have actual emergencies to deal with. Young man next door got stabbed. That's real medicine. Your psychosomatic belly ache can be handled by your GP on Monday. He started to leave, but I grabbed the rails of The bed, please. Something's wrong. I can feel it. He pried my fingers off one by one. This is drug seeking behavior. Are you here for pain pills? Because that's not happening. A nurse came in and harm told her loudly. Just anxiety. Probably wants attention. Her husband probably doesn't listen to her anymore, so she comes here for someone to talk to. He didn't know. My husband died two years ago in this very hospital. Don't waste resources on blood work. Give her some antacids and discharge papers. The nurse looked uncertain, but he snapped. Did I stutter, or do you want to be a doctor now, too? When I asked for a different doctor, he got nastier. You want a doctor shop? Classic drug seeking. I'm noting this in your file. He pulled up my chart on the computer. Oh, look, you've been here before. Frequent flyer. Lonely old women love the attention from young doctors. It's pathetic, but common. He didn't scroll down far enough to see my employment history at this hospital. The pain was getting worse and I doubled over, which made him roll his eyes dramatically. The performance isn't necessary. I've seen better acting from kindergarteners. He called another resident over. Watch this. Classic case of Munchausen's in the elderly.

Maybe some friends, hobby, anything besides wasting our time. He grabbed my arm roughly to pull me up, and I cried out, stop the theatrics! I'm documenting this as a psych case.

My cousin Brianna sent out the most insane wedding invitation I've ever seen. Under the dress code, in bold letters, it said, no female guests. This includes family members, plus ones, and children. Male attendees only. I thought it was a typo until she called me personally. I know it seems harsh, she said, but I need my wedding day to be about me. Other women always steal attention. This is my solution. I tried reasoning with her. Brianna, your own mother can't come to your wedding. She'll understand. Besides, she always cries and makes everything about her emotions. Real reason came out after 20 minutes of talking. Brianna was convinced that her fiance, Jerome, would leave her for someone prettier. She'd caught him liking other women's photos online and decided the only solution was to eliminate all competition from her big day. The family was in uproar. Her mother sobbed for days. Her three sisters were devastated. Even Jerome's mother was banned. But Brianna wouldn't budge. She hired all male vendors. Male photographer, male caterers, male florist. She even found a male makeup artist to do her hair and makeup. Two weeks before the wedding, I got a call from Jerome's best man, Terrell. This is insane. He's. Jerome's trying to support her, but his mom is threatening to disown him. Can't you talk sense into her? I tried one more time. Brianna just said, either support my Decision or don't come to the reception. Yes, she was allowing women at the reception, just not the ceremony, because that made sense in her world. The day of the wedding arrived. I wasn't there, obviously, but Terrell live streamed it for the banned women in a group chat. The venue looked beautiful, but eerily empty. Thirty men sat awkwardly in a space meant for 200. No one knew where to look or what to say. Then came the professional. Brianna had no bridesmaids, so she walked alone. The music started, the doors opened, and in walked nobody. The music played for a full minute while everyone stared at the empty doorway. Jerome started sweating. The efficient looked confused. Terrell ran to check. He found Brianna in the bridal suite, locked in the bathroom, having a complete meltdown. Her male makeup artist had given her what she called drag queen makeup. Her hair was teased into a massive Buffon. She looked like she was competing in a pageant from 1987 without any women around to help fix it. She'd been trying to redo everything herself and made it worse. But that wasn't why she was really crying. Through the door. She admitted the truth. I've been so focused on keeping women away that I forgot this meant I'd have nobody to share this with. No mother daughter moment, no sisters helping with my dress. I'm completely alone on the most important day of my life. Jerome went to talk To her, we could hear him through Terrell's phone. Baby, this. It's crazy. You banned my mother? Your mother? What are we doing? I just didn't want you looking at other women, she sobbed. I'm looking at other women every day because you made this wedding into a circus! Everyone's talking about the bride who banned women, not the bride I'm marrying. You created the exact attention you were trying to avoid. She finally came out an hour later, makeup streaked, hair deflated. They did a quick ceremony with just the officiant, Jerome Terrell, and Brianna's father, who looked like he wanted to disappear here. The reception was even worse. All the band women showed up, but the atmosphere was ice cold. Brianna tried to act like nothing happened, but everyone knew. Her mother sat in the corner crying. Her sisters left after 15 minutes. Jerome's mother didn't even show up. The photographer, who'd only been hired for his gender, turned out to be terrible. Every photo was

We've been together two years. Last month, his college girlfriend Madison died from cancer at just 26. They'd broken up five years ago, but stayed friends on social media. I'd always felt a little weird about their friendship, but I trusted him completely. He was absolutely devastated when she passed. Took a week off work, barely ate anything. Just lay in bed scrolling through old photos of them together. I tried being supportive, making his favorite meals, bringing him tea, giving him space when he needed it. Then he started talking about her constantly. Madison always made the best lasagna from scratch with her grandmother's recipe. Madison would have absolutely loved this movie. She had such incredible taste in everything. Madison understood my twisted sense of humor better than anyone ever has or probably ever will. At first I thought it was completely normal grief. People reminisce about lost friends all the time, right? I figured he'd work through it naturally, but it escalated really quickly. He began comparing literally everything I did to Madison. When I cooked dinner, he'd mention how Madison's version was somehow better. When I laughed at his jokes, he'd say Madison's laugh was more genuine and musical. When I wore certain outfits, he comment that Madison had better style sense. It got really weird when he asked me to dye my hair blonde like Madison's had been. Said it would help him feel closer to those happy memories during this in readily difficult time in his life. I refused Point Blank. He got genuinely upset, accused me of being selfish and unsupportive during his grief. Said a truly loving girlfriend would understand what he was going through and try to help him heal properly. That hurt deeply, but I tried to stay patient. Everyone grieves differently, and I didn't want to be the terrible girlfriend who couldn't handle her boyfriend mourning a friend. Last week, I found him at two a m. Sitting at our kitchen table, writing intensely in a leather journal I'd never seen before, page after page about Madison. How she was his true soulmate and the only woman who truly understood his deepest soul. He wrote things like, I made the biggest mistake of my life letting her go, and I settled for someone lesser because I was terrified of real, assuming love. I was reading over his shoulder in the dark hallway when he finally noticed me standing there. He slammed the journal shut and got incredibly defensive. Said it was private therapy and I was serious, seriously violating his personal boundaries. The absolute final straw was yesterday evening. We're at dinner with his parents at their favorite Italian restaurant, when his mom casually mentions that Madison had sent her a lasagna recipe years ago. He immediately tears up and says, I'll never love anyone the way I loved her. She was absolutely Perfect in every single way imaginable. His dad looked completely horrified. His mom tried desperately changing the subject to the web.

And now that I'm rich, he demands that I give him our house and support him for the rest of his life. I was 15 when my parents died. No family ended up on the streets until a government program gave me housing and half minimum wage until 18. When that ended, I couldn't get work because I had no address. Finally got a job at a diner making almost nothing. That's where I met Cody, my now husband. He was a regular customer and we talked for hours. Six months later, I moved in with him. His dad hated me from day one. Called me worthless, said I'd drag his son down. I paid their rent, bills, groceries. Saved every penny for our future. Didn't matter. Daily insults, constant judgment. Street rat. He'd call me at dinner. My son deserves better than some homeless girl. Cody would defend me, but his dad would just laugh. She's using you, son. Mark my words. I worked doubles at the diner while Cody did construction. Every night I'd come home exhausted to more criticism. Still smell like grease. His dad would sneer, this is what failure looks like. The worst part? I genuinely tried to win him over. Cooked his favorite meals, cleaned the house spotless. Even bought him birthday gifts with money I could barely spare. Nothing worked. One Christmas. I saved for months to buy him a nice watch. He opened it, looked gusted, and said, I don't need charity from a charity case. Then he threw it in the trash right in front of me. Cody's friends would come over, and his dad would introduce me as the homeless girl Cody's wasting his time with. I'd sit there humiliated while everyone looked at me with pity. One night, we came home from a date, and he wouldn't let us in. Said he'd sold our clothes and stolen our savings. I won't support two losers who'll never succeed. We slept in my car that night. Cody cried. First time I'd ever seen him break down. I'm sorry, he kept saying. I should have stood up to him sooner. Got a tiny room near the diner. Cody found work. The room was so small, we had to take turns getting dressed. Ate a ramen for months, but we were finally free. We took a loan, opened our own small restaurant. After hours, Cody would cook while I waited tables. We'd work our day jobs, then run to our place until midnight. The first year was brutal. Barely breaking even, working 16 hour days, sleeping four hours a night. His dad would drive by sometimes just to laugh at us through the window. But slowly, customers started coming back. Word spread. Local food blogger gave us five stars. Lines started forming outside. We hired our first employee, a kid from The streets like me. Then another. Cody insisted we pay above minimum wage. Everyone deserves a real chance, he'd say. Years passed. That one restaurant became five, then 10. We built an empire. Cody proposed in our flagship restaurant. You turn my life around, he said. Let's make it official. His dad wasn't invited to the wedding. We had two kids, Sophia and Frederick. Cody turned into the most incredible father. I want to be everything my dad wasn't, he'd say while reading them bedtime stories. Our company went public three years ago. We're worth about 50 million now. Bought a mansion in the hills with a pool the kids love. Cody's mom visits sometimes. Divorced his dad years ago and finally admits he was always horrible.

But I went along with it and watched her and her lawyer embarrass themselves in front of the judge. We split custody fifty fifty when we divorced 3 years ago. Same salaries, same time with our 5 year old daughter, so no child support needed. That was the deal we both signed off on. But my ex got greedy. She quit her job to find herself enrolled in some online marketing course, then dropped out after two months when it got hard. Suddenly she's blowing up my phone demanding $200 monthly because I control my finances better than her. I laughed it off until her lawyer contacted me. Fine. I thought, let's play this game. Here's what she didn't know. I'm meticulous with records. Every receipt, every bank statement, every expense tracked to the penny. And color coded bed sheets. It's literally how I survived our messy divorce. Her lawyer filed the case without requesting my actual income. They just guessed based on my old job from two years ago and guessed wrong. They estimated I made 30% more than reality and had half my actual expenses. Basic mistake number one. Meanwhile, I'm gathering evidence like I'm building a criminal case. Stubs, rent receipts, grocery bills, medical co pays, our daughter's dance class fees, everything organized by date and category. As we approached court, my lawyer called with an update. Her attorney figured out She'd been lying about her financial situation and wanted to settle immediately. She doesn't want to go to court anymore, he said, barely containing his laughter. But my ex refused the settlement. She was convinced she'd win because judges always side with the mom. Court day arrives. Sitting there in my best suit, folder full of evidence, watching her strut in like she owns the place. The judge reviews both our financial statements side by side. I watch his expression change from neutral to confused to visibly annoyed. Plot twist after calculating everything properly, she actually had more disposable income than me. Way more. Her unemployment benefits, plus child tax credits, plus help from her new boyfriend, plus the side gig she forgot to mention. It all added up. The judge looked directly at her. Ma'am, you're asking him to pay support when you have $400 more per month than available income? Her lawyer literally face palmed and started shuffling papers like he was looking for an escape route. But it gets exponentially better. She'd submitted completely falsified bank statements as supporting evidence, claiming she only had $75 in total savings. The judge caught the deception immediately. Dates didn't match the statement periods, dollar amounts were clearly altered with correction fluid. The bank routing numbers were from a completely different financial institution. Ma'am, are you fully aware that knowingly submitting false evidence to this court constitutes perjury, which is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison? The Judge asked, his voice absolutely ice cold. My ex Heather went completely pale and start

So I got the perfect revenge. She crashed our cabin weekend claiming her Airbnb fell through. I knew it was BS the moment she showed up with a perfectly packed bag and a smug smile. My boyfriend Joseph felt bad for her and invited her to stay without even asking me. For three days straight, she kept creating these elaborate situations to make me look like the worst girlfriend ever. Like when she helped make dinner on Friday night. She volunteered to preheat the oven while I prepped ingredients. Everything seemed normal until I put our carefully marinated steaks in and they came out completely charred. She acted shocked when Joseph got mad at me for ruining our expensive dinner. Later, I noticed she'd secretly cranked the oven to 500 degrees. Saturday morning, she suggested we go hiking to this amazing waterfall she'd been to for. She gave me detailed directions to the trailhead while she rode with Joseph. Turns out she sent me to the wrong trail entirely. I spent two hours lost in the woods with no cell service while they bonded over waiting for me. When I finally found them at the actual trailhead, Joseph was visibly annoyed I'd kept them waiting. She just shrugged and said, oh, I guess I mixed up the directions. My bad. The manipulation got worse as the weekend went on. She kept doing this thing where she'd bring up inside jokes and memories from before I existed, making me. I feel like an outsider in my own relationship. Remember when we did this? And remember when we did that? Always with this little smile directed at me. She'd also accidentally brush against Joseph, constantly grab his arm when laughing, and find excuses to lean over him. During Saturday afternoon, we decided to go swimming in the lake. She conveniently forgot to pack a swimsuit and asked to borrow one of mine. The one she picked was my smallest bikini, and she made sure to comment loudly about how loose it was on her while adjusting it right in front of Joseph. Then she suggested we play volleyball in the water and kept accidentally bumping into me, making me lose my balance. The breaking point was Saturday night, we were all sitting by the fire when she pretended to be drunk and started crying about how much she missed the old days before I came along and changed everything. She was literally sobbing into Joseph's shoulder about how their friend group was never the same, how she felt like she was losing her best friend, and how things used to be so much. My boyfriend was actually comforting her, rubbing her back, and telling her nothing had changed between them. That's when I noticed something crucial. All weekend, she'd been taking tons of photos with Joseph's phone and hers, documenting every Moment. But I realized she was only capturing me when I looked terrible. Messy hair from hiking, unflattering angle while eating, caught mid chew, or when I was frustrated and arguing. Meanwhile, every single photo of her was perfectly posed and filtered. So while she was in the bathroom touching up her makeup for the 10th time that day, I grabbed her phone. She'd left it unlocked on the counter next to the sink. I scrolled through her camera roll and found the absolute worst photo she'd taken all weekend of herself. Double chin, eyes half closed, food stuck in her teeth, hair a complete disaster. It was from when she was laughing too hard at one of Joseph's jokes and snorting. I posted it to her Instagram story.

One day my kids came up to me and told me they didn't want to go over to mommy's house anymore. I had split custody with my ex, but this was the first time when they outright refused to visit her for the weekend. I knelt down to their level and asked them what was up. Did Mommy say something to you? Then they told me how Mommy's new boyfriend would make them do weird things and also made them promise not to tell anyone. When I asked what these things were, my heart was shattered into a million pieces. Would make both my kids stand in front of a camera and strip to their undies. Then he would take a few pictures, give them both some candy and go back to his room. At first my kids were happy to get free candy, but they eventually realized that something was wrong and became uncomfortable. So they asked him to stop. my wife's boyfriend landed an open handed slap on my daughter's face. They went to their mommy to complain and told her the absolute truth while crying. But instead of helping them, she told them to stop being jealous of her new relationship. She was under the impression that I had told our kids to spin this story and simply refused to believe them. I was so angry but also distraught at the same time. The First thing I did was call the cops. But the person who showed up was my wife's brother in law who was also a deputy. He told me the same thing that my wife said to our kids, stop being jealous and stop telling disgusting lies about other people just because you can't handle their happiness. I don't know what kind of mother my ex wife was being that she didn't even consider the possibility of her boyfriend actually doing this. I knew one thing, which was I couldn't just stay still. I sent my kids to my parents house. Before taking action, I was a regular at this local bar where I had made friends with these two ex convicts, both.

So I'm 24 and I've been vegan for like 10 years now ever since I was a little kid and found out where meat comes from. I just couldn't do it anymore. Everyone in my life knows this, my family, friends, co workers, literally everyone. Four nights ago, I was at this party at my friend Jake's place. I'll be honest, I got absolutely wasted, like embarrassingly drunk. My friends were all laughing and having a good time and I was just trying to keep up with everyone else. Around midnight, I got super hungry. You know how it is when you're drunk. My friend Caitlin comes up to me with this made of chicken nuggets and I'm like, oh, these look good. Are they vegan? She goes, yeah, totally. They're those sunfed ones from the store. I knew sunfed made pretty good fake chicken stuff, so I trusted her. I grabbed like 6 nuggets and started eating them. It tasted kind of weird, but I figured it was just because I was drunk and my taste buds were off. Plus the lighting was dim and I couldn't really see them that well. I finished the whole plate and didn't think anything of it. The next morning I woke up with the worst hangover ever. My head was pounding and I felt sick to my stomach. But then around noon, my sister Emma text me saying you need to check Jake's Snapchat. Story right now, I had this sinking feeling in my gut. I opened Snapchat and there it was. The first video showed Caitlin holding up a package of actual chicken nuggets, like real Tyson chicken nuggets from the freezer section. Then the next video was me asking if they were vegan and her saying yes. Then there's this clip of me eating them and being all happy and drunk. But the worst part was the last few videos after I left the party, they filmed themselves pretending to be me. When I would find out Caitlin was fake crying and screaming, oh, no, the poor chickens. In this mocking voice, Jake was pretending to throw up and going, I can't believe I ate a real animal. They, we're all laughing hysterically. I screen recorded everything before they could delete it. I was shaking. I was so angry. This wasn't just some harmless joke. They knew how important being vegan was to me. They knew I hadn't eaten meat in over 10 years and they filmed themselves mocking something that was genuinely important to me. I called my sister first and she was furious. She told me I should definitely do something about it. Then I called my mom and she said the same thing. They both said this went way beyond a normal prank. I spent like 2 hours researching online and found out that deliberately giving someone food they can't or won't eat can actually be considered food tampering. Especially when it's done without their knowledge and filmed for humiliation purposes. So I drove to the police station with all the video evidence. The officer I talked to was actually really understanding. He said they'd seen cases like this before, especially with people who have food allergies or dietary restrictions for religious reasons. He took my statement and all the evidence. Within three days, Caitlin, Jake and another friend named Austin, who was also involved, got served with charges. Food tampering is apparently a misdemeanor, but it can still go on your record and everything. My lawyer friend told me I actually have a pretty strong case. Food tampering is taken seriously, especially when there's video evidence and it was done specifically to cause distress. Plus, the public humiliation aspect makes it even worse. The court date is next month. And honestly, I'm not sure what's going to happen.

A buddy of mine was caught messing with his phone during class. Back then, the school rules were that if you were caught, your phone was confiscated for an entire day and you couldn't get it back until the next day. This was before smartphones and the rules have changed since then. So, oh, buddy hands in his phone but doesn't seem too worried about it. He waits a couple of classes until lunch break and asks me to come with him. He's gonna get his phone back. We went to the staff room where the confiscated phones were held and asked a teacher there if he could copy down a phone number into my phone so he could call his dad later that day. Teacher agrees and gives him the phone. I hand him mine and we wait for him to copy the number. When he's done, he gives me mine back and sticks his own phone in his pocket. He was known as a bit of a joker, so when he jokingly said, well, thanks a lot, see ya, the teacher immediately laughs, tells him to stop messing about and to give the phone back. Laughing and joking about being caught, he does, but not really. See, he had a second phone, the exact same model, except this one was broken, wouldn't charge anymore, he said. So when he stuck his good phone in his pocket, it Was right next to the broken one. When the teacher made him give back the phone, he just gave back the broken one. It was the best switcharoo I have ever seen.

One time I pretended to get on the phone with the Arizona name registry and renamed my two kids snorkle and Gorf because they kept misbehaving. They were bawling. I could barely keep a straight face. 2, I was on a flight where a kid saw the button for calling a flight attendant, didn't know what it was, but clearly was thinking about pressing it, and so asked his dad what it did. His dad said it opens a trap door under your seat and drops you out of the bottom of the plane. Afterwards, the kids spent the whole flight intrigued by the button, thinking about and talking about pushing it, but too worried to actually do it. 3, not exactly a lie, but when I was first learning swear words, my parents made the mistake of telling me the those were words only mommies and daddies are allowed to say. So I was playing house with my sister and her friends and I was the dad. I promptly went on a swearing tirade as the dad and got in big trouble. Four, when we were in the car and it was raining, my mom would wait for a bridge or tunnel. And as we approached it, she would tell us she was going to make the rain stop in 3:21. She told us she could only Make the rain stop for a minute because it made her so tired. My siblings and I were convinced she was magic.

My therapist told me to write letters to an imaginary boyfriend. I know it sounds crazy, but after my last breakup left me feeling completely broken, she said it would help me figure out what I actually wanted in a relationship. So I made up this guy named Ryan. Perfect guy on paper. Thoughtful, funny. Remembered my coffee order, never interrupted me when I talked about work drama. I was supposed to do this exercise for a month. Seven months later, I was still writing to Ryan. Every single night before bed, I tell him about my day, write about fights we'd have and how we'd work through them without screaming at each other. I even wrote about him meeting my parents at Christmas, how he'd bring my mom flowers and actually listen when my dad talked about golf for three hours straight. The problem started when I printed one of the letters at work by mistake. My coworker Ben found it in the printer tray. Tuesday morning, he walked over to my desk holding this piece of paper, grinning like he'd discovered buried treasure. So who's the mystery boyfriend? He asked, waving the letter around. Ryan. Sounds like a catch. When do we get to meet him? I should have laughed it off, made up some story about a guy I was seeing. Instead, I panicked. I grabbed the letter so fast, I knocked over My coffee all over my keyboard. Ben just stood there looking confused while I frantically tried to clean up the mess, mumbling something about how it was nobody important. That night, I sat in my apartment staring at the stack of letters I'd written. 43 letters to a guy who didn't exist. I realised I've been comparing every real guy I met to Ryan, and obviously none of them could compete with someone I'd literally designed to be perfect. But then something weird started happening. I began noticing things about Ben that reminded me of stuff I'd written about Ryan. Like how he always brought me soup when I called in sick. Never questioned it or made it weird how he actually listened when I talked instead of just waiting for his turn to speak. He even started putting that ridiculous Sriracha sauce on everything. After I mentioned in one letter how Ryan loved spicy food, it hit me. One Friday when we were walking to the parking garage after work, Ben stopped at the Little Flower stand outside our building and bought daisies for his neighbour because her cat had just died. That's exactly something I'd written about Ryan doing. Standing there watching him count out quarters for this tiny old lady, I realised I might have been writing about Ben this whole time without even knowing it. So I told him everything. Right there in the parking garage, between a Honda Civic and someone's motorcycle. I explained about The therapy exercise about Ryan. About how I've been writing love letters to an imaginary person for seven months. Like some kind of crazy person. I told him how he'd somehow become everything I've been pretending Ryan was. Ben listened to the whole thing without interrupting once. When I finished, he was quiet for so long, I thought he was going to call security or something. Then he smiled and said, well, That explains why you always knew exactly what kind of coffee I liked. Turns out he'd been trying to ask me out for months, but thought I had a boyfriend because I kept mentioning Ryan. We've been together for three weeks now, and I finally threw away all those letters. Ryan was great, but Ben's real.

She actually said I could give them back like they were borrowed lawn equipment or something. I sat down with Caleb, who's 15 now, and asked what he wanted. He looked me dead in the eyes and said he never wanted to see her again. He remembered everything, the hunger, the fear, having to take care of his sisters when Emma would disappear for days. Sophie, who's 10 now, barely remembers Emma at all. She calls me mom and has for years. Grace doesn't know Emma exists. And honestly, I've never brought her up, but my family won't let it. Go.

I need to be practical about my future. After she pulled out a prenup that could leave me with nothing. Allison and I had been together three years, engaged for six months, with our wedding planned for four months away. I'm a software engineer making $120,000. She works in marketing making $75,000. We. We're supposed to close on our first house in two weeks. I was contributing thirty five thousand dollars of the fifty thousand dollar down payment. Last Sunday she invited me to dinner at her parents upscale home. Her mom had prepared an elaborate spread and her dad, Greg was being unusually friendly, asking about my work and laughing at my jokes. Normally he treated me politely, but distantly. I thought they were finally accepting me as family. Halfway through dinner, Allison suddenly got this serious, rehearsed look. Sean, I think we should sign a prenuptial agreement before the wedding, she said, pulling out a Manila folder and sliding it across the table. My stuff like dropped. This whole dinner had been a setup. Her parents were nodding along. The prenup demanded complete financial separation. Separate bank accounts, separate credit cards, separate everything. But the real estate clause was the worst part. The house we were buying together would be titled solely in Allison's name. If we divorced, I'd walk away with nothing. Regardless of contributions to mortgage payments or improvement. I'd be paying Allison to live in a house She owned. When I asked why she suddenly wanted this, her mom jumped in. It's just smart financial planning, Sean. Surely someone in your field understands protecting assets. Her dad added, nothing personal, just business. This is how people like us protect what we've built. But when we started house shopping, Allison put for both our names on everything, saying it would show we were truly committed as partners. Now suddenly, she wanted legal separation of everything. I said I needed time to review it with a lawyer. The silence was deafening. A lawyer? Allison's voice pitched higher. I thought you'd be more mature about this. Monday morning, my lawyer, James, reviewed the document. His reaction was immediate. Sean, this is one of the most one sided documents I've ever seen. Don't sign this. He explained I'd pay half the mortgage, taxes, and maintenance on an asset entirely hers if we divorced. This reads like someone already planning for divorce while expecting you to subsidize her life until that happens. So I made two decision. I wouldn't sign the prenup, and I was withdrawing from the house purchase. I called our realtor and removed my name. Since Allison couldn't qualify for the mortgage alone without my contribution, this killed the deal. I also moved my $50,000 from our joint savings back to my personal account. When Allison discovered this, she called screaming, accusing me of sabotaging our relationship. Her family launched desperate attempts to pressure me.

I replied, he changed mine, too. She didn't know he was my divorce lawyer. Celine had been acting weird for months. It started small. Suddenly caring about her appearance again, buying new clothes she couldn't afford on her teacher's salary. Then came the secret phone calls, where she'd step outside or lock herself in the bathroom. When I'd ask who called, she get defensive and say it was just her sister. The mysterious meetings were next. Working late at school again, she text. But when I drove by the parking lot at eight PM, her car wasn't there. She'd come home smelling like expensive Cologne and wine, claiming she'd grab dinner with colleagues. I'm not stupid. I knew something was happening. But after eight years together, I figured I owed it to us to try counseling first. That's when I started secretly meeting with Elias Thorn, the best divorce attorney in town. We've been planning my exit strategy for three months. Protecting my business, our joint accounts, the house I bought before we got to together. When she asked to talk last Friday, sitting at our kitchen table with this nervous energy, I knew what was coming. I'm leaving you, she said. And for the first time in months, she looked genuinely happy. I met someone incredible. A successful lawyer who actually understands me. She went on and on about how amazing he was, how intelligent, how sophisticated, how different. From me. He's handling this huge divorce case right now, making tons of money. He took me to that new French place downtown last week. You know, the one with the $200 steaks you said was too expensive. I just sat there, letting her paint this picture of her new life. She was practically glowing as she described their relationship. How he understood her need for finer things, how he made her feel valued and desired. He's taking me to Napa this weekend, she continued, her eyes bright with excitement. Says he's going to change my life forever. We're staying at some resort that costs more per night than you make in a week. The dig was unnecessary, but typical Celine. She'd always resented that I ran a small construction business instead of wearing suits and working in an office. I kept my voice calm and asked, that's nice. What's his name? Elias Thorn. She seemed like she was announcing she'd won the lottery. He's brilliant. Drives an Audi RS six, has this gorgeous office downtown. Everything I've always wanted. My stomach dropped, but I kept my face completely neutral. Elias Thorn wasn't just any lawyer. He was my divorce attorney. The one I've been secretly meeting with every Thursday for three months. The one who knew every detail about our finances, our relationship problems, our joint asset. Sounds great. I managed. When are you leaving? Tonight. He's picking me up at 7. I already packed a bag. She gestured. Toward her suitcase by the door, like she couldn't wait to escape. After she went upstairs to shower and get ready, I sat in my truck and called Elias. Straight to voicemail. I texted, emergency. Need to talk before Monday. Two hours later, while Celine was doing her makeup, he called back.

Seventeen students went to the hospital on picture day. And it wasn't because of a shooting. It was because my principal decided water bottles were more dangerous than dehydration. I was filling my Hydro Flask from the one working vending machine when Principal Morrison yanked it from my hands. New policy. No water bottles on campus. Zero tolerance. She dumped it out. But we don't have fountains, I said. Then buy milk at lunch. She replied, we just moved into a brand new building with beautiful glass windows and smartboards everywhere. There was just one massive problem. Contractors had built walls over where the water fountains were supposed to go. Completely broke them in the district. Solution? One vending machine selling water at $2 each for 2,000 students. Our school sat across from a grocery store, and some freshmen began buying cases of water to sell bottles for a dollar, undercutting the school. Then they stepped up their game. They started stealing mini vodka bottles, transferring them to water bottles, and taking orders via Snapchat. Ten bucks a bottle. They had code names, distribution network, and kids posted in different hallways. Attendance hit record highs because kids who hadn't shown up since middle school were suddenly never missing a day. By October, sophomores stumbled through calculus while freshmen puked in planters. Half the sophomore class was buzzed by noon. The administration held an emergency meeting, and Morrison announced her Solution we banned water bottles. Problem solved. Monday morning, security confiscated everything at the door. Hydroflasks, nalgenes, even prescription eye drops because they were clear liquid in a container. They covered bathroom sinks with not for drinking signs, and the vending machine disappeared overnight. But here's what they didn't realize. By Tuesday, the nurse ran out of paper cups. 40 kids an hour coming in dizzy. She told anyone who'd listen, but nobody listened. Wednesday, three kids fainted during PE when Coach Martinez gave them water from his bottle. Morrison suspended him for enabling violations. And things got worse. Week 2 brought desperate creativity. Smore sold water in Ziploc bags for $5 a sip. Someone brought a fish bowl for biology that mysteriously emptied by lunch. A kid got expelled for running a Capri Sun cartel. The football team started drinking pickle juice, while the chess club bought unlimited chocolate milk. The cafeteria ran out of everything liquid except ranch dressing. Which one desperate kid actually tried drinking? Week three escalated beyond anyone's imagination. The nurse sent seven kids home in one day, including the diabetic who couldn't take insulin without water and the girl who passed out during Sats. The track team refused to practice. Morrison threatened suspension. They just laughed. The PTA meeting that usually had 12 moms suddenly had 400 angry parents. Morrison tried explaining about the vodka problem, then catch the kids with vodka. Someone's dad screamed, you don't ban water! She insisted it was simplest. And that's when someone's grandma stood up. You're dumber than rocks in my garden. By month two, we'd made the news. School bans, H2O spread everywhere. While the superintendent's email crashed from complaints. The health department launched investigations. Horizon kept defending herself to reporters. Hundred percent decrease in alcohol incidents. A reporter shot back. 500% increase in medical emergencies. Then came picture day, the hottest day of the school year. 102 degrees outside. About 120 in the gym with no AC. Three hours under photography lights and no water allowed. First hour, two freshmen collapsed. The photographer kept shooting, paid by photo, not ambulance. Second hour brought chaos. A senior vomited on camera equipment while a junior had a seizure. Parents rushed in with water bottles, throwing them to kids like life preservers. When security tried stopping them, a mom knocked a guard flat. Touch me again while my daughter's lips are blue. The fire department arrived to treat.

The landlord said I had the patience of a saint. After my third roommate complaint in two years, months of different slobs leaving their Mark, I impatient. The first roommate left pizza boxes until roaches appeared. One before him ate my food constantly, and another left used rubbers on the bathroom floor. Then this spoiled man child moved in and pushed me too far on a Thursday night, handing me the exact words I'd used to destroy him. I came home from my 12 hour shift to find maggots crawling out of his dish collection that had evolved into its own ecosystem. Not just dirty dishes, a biological hazard that would make health inspectors weep. The smell hit me like a physical wall. Six months of passive aggressive notes, six months of doing his dishes, six months of being the responsible adult had officially ended. Around 11 p m, I knocked on his door to have one final reasonable conversation. He opened it wearing nothing but boxers and a stained gaming headset around his neck. Energy drink cans creating a fortress around his computer. No acknowledgement of the kitchen situation, just annoyed I'd interrupted his raid. I calmly asked how we should handle splitting household responsibilities. Fairly. Bro laughed and said he didn't have time for drama when I pointed out the Literal maggots. He shrugged and said the five words that became his curse. Just figure it out yourself. Those words activated something primal in me. Six months of tolerance, six months of adulting. For 2 6 months of keeping the peace. But telling me to figure out his mess myself. I smiled, said okay, and walked away. Through his open door, I heard him laughing with his gaming buddies about his annoying roommate. Perfect. I was ready. I started that night by changing the Wi-Fi password, then removed every single item I purchased from common areas. Toilet paper, hand soap, dish soap, paper towels, even the light bulbs I bought. By morning, I transformed our apartment into a survival puzzle. The beautiful part? Everything was still technically there, just inaccessible. Router locked in my room. Circuit breaker key hidden. Thermostat reprogrammed with a password. Even the TV remote went to work with me in my backpack. Friday morning, I heard him stumbling around the dark bathroom. He knocked on my door, asking about the toy, the paper. I called through the door, figure it out yourself. The silence was delicious. He tried to shower. No hot water because I'd adjusted the water heater before work. Texted me about the Wi-Fi password. I responded with his favorite phrase. He had a girl coming over that night. I listened to him trying to explain why they had to use phone flashlights and why he couldn't stream Netflix. She left after 20 minutes. By Sunday, desperation set in. He tried everything, called the landlord, who said roommate

So I showed him what family honor meant. The first time I brought Justin to meet my grandfather, he served everyone tea, but handed Justin water in a paper cup. He said something in Mandarin to my uncle while smiling at Justin, and I told Justin he was welcoming him. But I caught the phrase, why Guoren, foreigner? The disdain in his tone made my chest tighten. That night, I told Justin we needed to prove grandfather wrong about him. We've been engaged six months. I knew exactly what would change Grandfather's mind. Three months later, grandfather was getting bolder. At my cousin's wedding, he pulled me aside and said in Mandarin that I was throwing away 5,000 years of heritage for someone who ate cereal for dinner. He actually brought his friend's grandson to meet me, a surgeon from Beijing. The guy was nice enough, but grandfather kept mentioning his medical degree while Justin stood there holding my hand, completely unaware of what was being said. Two weeks later, grandfather announced he would test Justin's worthiness at his upcoming 85th birthday. He said in Mandarin, knowing Justin couldn't understand, that when Justin failed to show proper respect, everyone would see I'd chosen poorly. That's when I knew we had our chance. I explained everything to Justin that night. What grandfather had been saying, what the test meant, and what we needed to do. Justin Was hurt but determined. Teach me, he said. I'll prove I can honor your family's traditions. We started practicing. Every weekend. I taught Justin the formal tea ceremony Grandfather's own father had performed, one most modern families had forgotten. Justin's hands would shake trying to hold the cups properly. He'd mess up the order of serving, forget to use both hands, pour too much or too little. We watched videos of traditional ceremonies until our eyes burned. I corrected his movements hundreds of times. After two months, he could get through the basic motions, but it looked foreign. Then came the dinner that almost ended everything. Grandfather made Justin sit at the far end of the table, saying the seats near him were for a true family. He announced in English so Justin would understand that respect for elders couldn't be Learned. You were either raised with it or you weren't. Justin's face went red, but he stayed quiet. That night, he practiced until 3:00am, determined to perfect every gesture. His fingers were cramping from holding the traditional positions. I found him in the kitchen the next morning, still practicing. Breakthrough came slowly. Four months into training, Justin could perform the movements, but they looked rehearsed, mechanical. Grandfather visited unexpectedly and caught Justin practicing the tea service in our kitchen. Pathetic mimicry, he said in English, then left without another word. Justin wanted to quit. I found him later, staring at the tea set, defeated. He's right. I'm just copying Movements. I don't understand. We spent the next week not just practicing, but discussing why each gesture mattered. The philosophy behind the hierarchy, the meaning in the movements. Two months before the birthday, something finally clicked for Justin. The ceremony stopped being a performance and became genuine, express. He understood that serving elders first wasn't just protocol. It was acknowledging their sacrifices, their wisdom, their role as family foundation. He Learned grandfather's father's birthday blessing. Practice the proper pronunciation until his throat was raw. More importantly, he understood what the words meant, why they mattered. The movements became natural, flowing. Even I was surprised watching him practice. He looked like he'd been doing this his whole life. Three days before grandfather's birthday, Justin was

I'd always been the smartest kid in my class, but my family was broke, like really broke. My parents worked cleaning jobs at the airport and always told me, we'll get you there somehow whenever I talked about college. But I knew the numbers didn't add up. My mom made $8 an hour and my dad made nine. There was no way. My junior year, my counselor, Missus Douglas, pulled me aside. She had this serious look on her face that made my stomach drop. Lena, you made it to the finals for the state academic scholarship. She said. There are only three students left. I couldn't breathe. This was it. Full ride to any college in the state. I went home and told my parents and my mom actually cried. She hugged me so tight I thought my ribs would crack. We knew you could do it, baby, she whispered. I spent three weeks working on that final essay. Stayed up three nights straight, revised it 10 times, had my English teacher look at it twice. I wrote about growing up, watching my parents come home exhausted every single day, about studying by flashlight when the power got cut off, about wanting to be the first person in my family to graduate college. Two weeks after I submitted it, Mrs. Douglas called me into her office again. This time she looked sad. Lena, I'm sorry. The committee Chose someone else. I didn't cry. I just nodded and said okay. But inside, I felt like someone had punched me in the chest. I walked out of her office, sat behind the school cafeteria by myself and stared at the parking lot. All those cars belong to kids whose parents could just write checks for college. That night, I told my parents. My mom hugged me again and said, there will be other chances, sweetheart. But I could see it in her eyes. She knew this was probably my only real shot. The thing is, missus Douglas had lied to me because I had won. I'd actually won the whole thing. But she knew something I didn't know about the run.

My boss, Rachel, is basically the coolest person at our advertising agency. Last month, she sent out the group text about her party on Friday night. Everyone was hyped, talking about it during lunch breaks, planning what to wear, the whole thing. But I never got the text. I figured maybe she just forgot to add me. Or maybe my phone was being weird. Thursday rolls around, and I'm hearing more party talk. People are discussing who's bringing what drinks, and someone mentioned the karaoke machine. I'm starting to feel pretty left out, but I don't wanna seem desperate by asking about it. Friday afternoon comes, and everyone's buzzing about getting ready after work. That's when I finally worked up the courage to walk into Rachel's office. I knocked on her door, and she looked up with this bright smile. Hey, what's up? She said. I took a deep breath. So, um. I think there might have been a mix up. I didn't get the text about tonight's party. Her face immediately changed, like all the color just drained out of it. She stared at me for what felt like forever before clearing her throat. Oh, right about that, she started fidgeting with her pen. The thing is, this party is more of a core team event. Core team? I've been there for two years. I worked overtime constantly and never complained. Brought donuts every Friday and covered For people when they were sick. What do you mean, core team? I asked. She couldn't even look at me. Well, you know, people who are more central to the office dynamic. That hit me like a punch to the gut. I just nodded and walked out. The whole office cleared out at five sharp, and I sat there alone, pretending to work, while everyone else headed to have fun without me. But here's where it gets interesting. Around 9 that night, I get a call from my friend Jamie, who works in accounting. She's whispering and sounds panicked. Dude, you need to check Rachel's Instagram story, like, right now. I open Instagram, and there's Rachel's story from the party. Everyone's having a blast, dancing, playing beer pong. But in the background of one video, I see

Turns out he was actually allergic. He didn't come to school for three days and I was terrified. To this date, no one knows that I did it. Two. When I was in elementary school, I once lost something, so I asked to go to the lost and found. In the lost and found room, which was a big storage closet. They also stored the soda for the vending machines. I took one. Then probably three to four times a week, I'd remember I lost something else and go steal another soda. I don't know how long I did this for, but I got a lot of free soda. 3 probably 15 years ago, my sister had a gerbil, and one day I decided to bring it out of her cage and surprise her in the living room with it. Somehow I slipped on carpet and the gerbil went flying head first into the wall. It basically sounded like I threw a golf ball at the wall and the gerbil wasn't moving. Naturally, I put it back in its cage and removed myself from the vicinity. To my amazement, the damn thing was still alive and moving around a few minutes later. And lived another two years without anyone ever knowing that I basically kobyed it into the wall at full speed. 4 I didn't know My best friend's name for almost 10 years. She goes by Katie almost exclusively and got it in my head early on that it was short for Caitlin. Imagine my surprise when I heard her being referred to as Catherine at our convocation. No right way to bring that one up in a conversation. 5. I really don't like slash care for anyone in my family. 6. One Christmas I was nine years old and knew that Santa wasn't real, but for my seven year old brother, the fantasy was very much alive and good. We shared a room and my brother woke up on Christmas morning and looked confused that Santa had not eaten the Kit Kat that had been left out. He went quiet and I could see that he was working the facts through in his head. When he wasn't looking. I ate the Kit Kat and showed him the wrapper and claimed he imagined seeing the wrapper unopened. This was 26 years ago and I have not told him in case he works out Santa is not real.

I stayed up crying that entire night but still had to go to work the next day. Halfway through my shift, I saw Leonardo DiCaprio come in with who I think was his mom. I could tell he didn't want to be bothered because he had a hat, sunglasses and unshaven. I still knew it was him and just pretended that I didn't realize who he was. This was right after Titanic, so I was completely freaking out inside. I didn't tell anyone and treated him like any other customer as best as I could. However, at the end of the meal, I couldn't resist. Before I brought him the check, I wrote, your movies are awesome, I hope. You like the food on his receipt. When he got up to leave, I could see him looking around and smiled when he saw me. I thought this was the coolest thing ever. And when I went to go clean their table, I saw he wrote back, thank you so much for not blowing my cover and left a 500 dollar tip. At the time, this was so much money, I thought it was an accident. I was about to go run outside to give it back, but he was already gone. I remember feeling like I literally couldn't breathe and just tried to act normal. As soon as my shift ended that day, I booked the next flight out to see my mom. I phoned to tell her I was coming and I literally ran through the hospital to her room. I got there in time to spend her last 20 minutes with her. Because of him, I got to hug my mom one last time as she passed.

My sister announces she has stage 3 lymphoma at family dinner and mom immediately starts crying while dad opens his wallet. Everyone's posting prayers on Facebook. Within minutes, I asked to see medical paperwork and get screamed at for being jealous. Jealous cancer. She launches this 50,000 dollar gofundme for experimental treatment insurance won't cover. And money starts pouring in from strangers, 500 here, thousand there. She's posting daily in grey hoodies with sad selfies and inspirational quotes about fighting. So I noticed she's eating sushi at lunch. Raw fish. You can't eat that on chemo. It'll literally kill you with your immune system gone. I point this out and my family calls me heartless. My, my sister makes this crying TikTok. Even my own sister doesn't support me. I get death threats in my DMS, actual death threats. My cousin texts, you're disgusting. She's dying and you're jealous. Then my sister posts this, quote, you know what hurts more than cancer? Having a sister who wants me dead. My stomach drops. She's turned everyone against me for asking one question, one question about paperwork. My mom won't even look at me at Sunday dinner. My dad says I should apologize for causing stress during her treatment. Treatment, right? Anyway, I start taking screenshots of everything. Tuesday, she posts at chemo all day, but she's tagged at a wine tasting two hours away. That same afternoon. I Screenshot both with time stamps. Then I find her Amazon account still logged in on the family computer. Order history shows real plastic bald cap. Forty seven dollars and ninety nine cents delivered last month. I screenshot the receipt. My hands are shaking. No one will believe me. They'll say I photoshopped it. But I keep going. I check the hospital visitor parking website, the one that validates tickets and it says her license plate never appears in the entire 3 months of her supposed treatment. I call the hospital building department and record the entire call. Legal in my state. They said they had no patient under her name. The woman on the phone sounds confused when I ask again. Meanwhile, my sister posts about chemo brain making her forget things. But that same night she wins a game of trivia at the local bar. She receives a 20 five dollar gift card to Red Lobster. I'm starting to feel crazy. Maybe I'm wrong. But then I see her doing perfect cartwheels in the backyard in the morning. She's training for a 5K. How? However, she'll bring up cancer fatigue anytime the family needs something done. Then her go fund me hits $38,000. I find her Venmo and see she's literally buying designer bags, not medicine. Every purchase was dated after her diagnosis. So I create a folder on my phone, 147 pieces of evidence. Each screenshot feels like an extra layer of armour in my fight to reveal The truth, I became a detective not because I wanted to, because nobody else would. However, my sister announces she's getting a bravery award at my aunt's charity gala. I tried to tell her this gala is for real pediatric cancer patients, kids who are actually dying. She scoffed at me and said she was a real patient, that she deserved this award for everything she had been going through. That's when I decided this ends tomorrow. On gala night, there are 200 guests, including real cancer survivors and sick children. My sister's on the stage in a silk head wrap giving a speech. Cancer taught me that angels walk among us. I noticed the bald cap edge peeking out. When she goes in to hug the mayor, he hands her the award plaque and she starts fake crying, dabbing carefully under her eyes. I walk on stage with my phone. Before we celebrate, can everyone look at the screen? I connect to the projector prearranged with the AV tech up top who lost his mom to actual cancer. The Amazon bald cap receipt appears. My sister's name and address on the big screen for all to see. Gasps. And there's the wine tasting screenshots, her Venmo purchases with gofundme money. Someone drops a champagne glass. My sister's frozen, stammering. This is, you don't understand. I walk up to her. Let's show them what's really under there. I pull off the head wrap, then peel the bald cap off. Perfect. Blonde hair tumbles down. A child in the front row starts crying. Her mother stands up. You stole from dying children. My aunt grabs the microphone. Security escort her out. My sister runs with the cap still dangling from her hand. Turns out the only thing terminal was her credibility.

So in my junior year, I had this horrible cavity that was killing me, but I couldn't get to the dentist for another week. The pain was unbearable. So I started carrying this little bottle of clove oil my mom gave me. If you've never used it, clove oil numbs your gums when you have tooth pain. Anyway, I'm sitting in English class, and this wave of pain hits me. So I pull out my little dropper bottle and put some on my finger, then rub it on my gum. My friend Marcos leans over and whispers, dude, are you taking drugs in class? I explain it's just clove oil for my tooth, and he asks, try it. Because his wisdom teeth were coming in, I let him have a drop, and within minutes, he's like, whoa, this stuff is amazing. By lunch, Marcos had told, like, five people about my magic potion, and they all wanted to try it. The next day, three different people showed up with their own little dropper bottles. One girl had peppermint oil, claiming it helped her focus. Another guy brought lavender oil, saying it calmed his test anxiety. By Wednesday, our chemistry teacher, Missus Patterson, noticed half the class pulling out tiny bottles before the quiz. She stopped the class and asked what was going on. When we explained, instead of shutting it down, she got excited and started talking about aromatherapy and Essential oils Thursday morning the morning announcements included a warning not to share oils because of potential allergies. This obviously made everyone want them more. Friday the hallways smelled like a weird combination of eucalyptus tea tree and something called Thieves Blend that apparently fights germs. The following Monday, some senior girls started wearing those little glass vial necklaces filled with different colored oils. By Wednesday, those necklaces were everywhere. The drama kids started wearing multiple vials color coded to their emotional needs for the day. Red for energy, blue for calm, purple for creativity. The football team got in on it, claiming peppermint oil improved their reaction time. They started rubbing it on their temples before practice. Our principal finally had to call an assembly about proper essential oil etiquette, which is possibly the weirdest assembly topic in school history. Actually made rules like no applying oils during class and no diffusers in lockers because someone had rigged one up with a small fan. The yearbook committee created a two page spread called the year of Essential Enlightenment with photos of students and their favorite oils. They interviewed me as the trend originator and I tried explaining I just had a toothache, but that part never made the final edit. The school nurse eventually started a scent free zone in her office for kids with allergies or sensitivities. The funniest part was parents started complaining about having to buy these expensive oils because their kids insist did they needed Them. The local health food store actually created a student starter kit with five tiny bottles for $25. My dentist finally fixed my cavity, but I kept carrying my clove oil as a weird good luck charm. Even teachers got into it. Our math teacher claimed lemon oil helped her grade papers faster, all because I had a toothache and couldn't get to the dentist. Sometimes the dumbest trends start from the most random necessity. Four years later and my younger sister says kids still bring oils to school, though now they claim it's for focus and emotional support, rather than admitting they're just following a trend that started because of my bad dental hygiene.

I looked at her confused. What trip? I didn't receive anything. My grandmother's face darkened as she turned to my parents. The fifteen thousand dollar graduation trip to Europe I sent for Diego three months ago. The silence was deafening. My mom started fidgeting with her new designer purse, the one that mysteriously appeared last month along with matching shoes. My dad's gold chain suddenly felt heavier around his neck. And I noticed his expensive watch for the first time. We. We thought it would be better if my mom stamp her newly done nails, tapping nervously on the table. If what? Grandma's voice cut like ice. If you stole from your own son. That's when it all clicked. The sudden shopping sprees every weekend. My sister's new iPhone, iPad and MacBook. Family vacation to Cancun that I wasn't invited to. A kitchen renovation. Dad's new motorcycle sitting in our driveway. They'd stolen my graduation gift and spent it on themselves like it was Christmas morning. My sister Estania, who never worked a day in her life, was wearing earrings that cost more than my monthly gas station salary. Diamond studs that sparkled under the restaurant lights. She and even look up from her plate, too busy admiring her fresh manicure. You gave them everything their entire lives, I said quietly, my voice shaking with years of suppressed anger. And they took the One thing meant for me. The one thing I actually earned. Grandma stood up, her chair scraping against the floor loud enough to make nearby diners turn. 20 years I've watched you favor Estania over Diego like he's invisible. I sent that money specifically for him. With a letter explaining every detail of the trip I planned. My mom's face went white as paper. We never got a letter, I swear. Because you threw it away after cashing the check that had his name on it. The restaurant felt silent, despite other diners around us. Even the waiters seemed to sense the drama unfolding at our table. I couldn't hold back anymore. This explains everything. Why you suddenly had money for mom's Botox appointment and weekly spa days. Why dad bought that Harley Davidson he's been wanting for years. Why Estania got her nose job and started posting Instagram photos from five star hotels every single week. My grandmother's eyes widened with each revelation. Nose job? Instagram photos? Show me. I pulled out my phone and showed her Estania's recent posts. Bullside shots at luxury resorts in Miami. Designer shopping halls from Rodeo Drive. First class plane seats with champagne glasses. Expensive restaurant meals that cost more than I made in a week. All time stamped from the past three months. Right after my graduation, I've been working 70 hour weeks at the gas station just to afford my rent and groceries. I continued my voice, getting stronger, eating ramen Noodles for dinner. While watching them feast like royalty, I thought maybe you'd forgotten about my graduation. Or maybe you were disappointed in me. But this whole time, they were living off money meant for me. Grandma scrolled through the photos, her face getting redder with each. This hotel cost $800 a night. I know because I stayed there last year. And this restaurant, their appetizers start at $50. My dad tried to interrupt, loosening his collar nervously. Mom, if you'd just let us explain the situation. Explain what, Nelson? How you forged my grandson's signature on bank documents? How you intercepted mail addressed specifically to him? How you've been lying to my face for months while spending his money? She reached into her purse and pulled out a thick envelope with legal documents. I brought copies of everything. Bank transfer with Diego's name, the hotel reservations in his name, the flight confirmations, the detailed itinerary. I spent weeks planning for his graduation gift. My mom started crying. But not the sorry kind of crying. The angry, caught kind, where she knew her game was over. You always liked him more than Estonia anyway, ever since they were kids. Because he works for everything he has. Grandma slammed the envelope on the table, making the wine glasses shake. While you've raised a spoiled princess who thinks the world owes her everything just for existing. Estonia finally spoke, her voice shaky and small. I didn't know it was Diego's money. I Swear! I thought it was just family money. Bullshit, I said, surprising myself with how calm and controlled I sounded. You knew exactly what you were doing when you posted those photos and tagged them. Living my best life while I was pulling double shifts and sleeping four hours a night. Other diners were definitely staring now, but I didn't care anymore. Years of being invisible in my own family was finally coming to an end. Grandma opened her purse and pulled out her phone with steady hands. I'm calling my lawyer tomorrow morning. Every penny gets repaid within 30 days, or I'm pressing charges for theft and fraud. My parents started begging, their voices overlapping and desperate. Please. But he was already walking away toward the exit. As she hugged me goodbye in the parking lot, she whispered, pack your bags. Tonight you're coming to live with me and finishing that master's degree you wanted. I'm also buying you that Europe trip again. And this time, you're actually going. The next morning, they found out grandma had already frozen their access to all her accounts. The repo man showed up for Dad's motorcycle by noon, and the bank called about their overdue credit card payments by evening.

This house is going up for sale. Everyone cheered and raised their glasses. I stepped outside and made one phone call. Ten minutes later, the screaming started. See, two years ago, when dad had his heart attack, I discovered something. They were three months behind on mortgage payment. The bank was for closing next week. My family had no idea. Dad was too proud to tell anyone. So I used my entire divorce settlement, $180,000, to buy the house at auction. I created an LLC called Clearwater Holdings and let them keep living there without telling them. I figured I'd transfer it back once they got stable again. Now my brother Marcus thinks he can just sell it and split the money. He's already called two realtors. The irony wasn't lost on me. For two years, I've been quietly paying property taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs. Every time something broke, I'd anonymously arrange for repairs. The new roof last spring. That was me. The HVAC system that mysteriously got warranty coverage. Also me. Marcus had been living rent free in a house I owned, while constantly reminding everyone how successful he was compared to his loser sister. When I walked back inside, he was drawing renovation plans on napkins with his wife Jennifer. We could add a wine cellar, he was saying, gesturing wildly with his beer. And a home theater, Jennifer added, her eyes practically glowing with dollar signs. Mom was nodding enthusiastically. Oh, and we could finally get that kitchen island I've always wanted. Dad sat quietly in his chair, looking uncomfortable but not saying anything. He'd always hated confrontation. My teenage nephew, Tyler was on his phone, probably already shopping for the car Marcus had promised him from his inheritance share. Actually, I said calmly, walking back to the dining room table, I need to tell you something important. Marcus didn't even look up from his sketching. If you're gonna beg us to let you stay, save it, he laughed. Decisions made. Jenny already found us a realtor friend who can get us top dollar. Really? I said, sitting down across from him. That's interesting, because I just got off the phone with my attorney. Mom rolled her eyes dramatically. Alex, Honey, you can't afford an attorney. Stop being so dramatic about this. James Morrison from Morrison and Associates, I continued, ignoring her comment. He specializes in real estate law. Dad finally looked up with interest. Why were you talking to a real estate attorney, sweetheart? Because I wanted to understand what happens when someone tries to sell a house they don't legally own. The room went completely silent. Even Tyler looked up from his phone. Marcus's pen stopped moving. What are you talking about? Mom and dad own this house. They've lived here for 30 years. They lived here for 30 years, I corrected calmly. But they haven't owned it for the past 14 months. Dad's Face had gone completely pale. Alex, what are you saying? I pulled out my phone and opened the email James had sent me. According to the county property records, this house is owned by Clearwater Holdings, LLC. It was purchased at foreclosure auction 14 months ago for $165,000. Marcus stood up so fast, his chair nearly fell over. That's impossible. There's no way. The original owners, Robert and Margaret

So you remember, you're not part of this family. While dad laughed hysterically. I'm 29. Always been the odd one out in the Peterson family. Different hair, different build, different everything. They joke about the mailman constantly. So when Sarah handed me that DNA kit with a smirk in time to prove what we all know, I wasn't even surprised. Dad was cracking up, mom nodding like she'd been waiting years for this moment. Fine, I said, but let's make it interesting. How about we all take DNA tests? You know, for science. The room went quiet. Sarah laughed nervously. Why would we need to? Because I already took one six months ago, I said, pulling out my phone. And according to 23 and me, I have a half sister named Jessica who's been looking for her biological family. I showed them Jessica's profile. Same last name as Mom's Maiden name. Same distinctive birthmark mom has on her wrist. Jessica was born nine months after Mom's business trip to Chicago in 1995. Remember that trip, mom? The one where you couldn't be reached for three days? Mom's face went white. Dad stopped laughing immediately. Oh, it gets better. I continued scrolling through my phone. Jessica wasn't the only surprise. I have three half siblings from Mom's various work conferences. I showed them photos. This is Michael from Denver, born in 1998. Ring any bells about that marketing seminar you Attended alone. Sarah grabbed the phone. That's not possible. And here's little Emma from Portland, born in 2,001. Funny how she has the same rare eye condition as Mom. Dad's face was turning red, but not from laughter anymore. Linda, what the hell is this? Best part? I pulled out a thick envelope from my jacket. I've been in contact with all three of them for months. They all want to meet their biological mother. In fact, they're driving here right now. Mom stood up shakily. You didn't. I did. Jessica should be here in about an hour. Michael's flying in from Denver tonight. Emma's parents are bringing her tomorrow morning for Christmas brunch. I looked at Sarah, who was still holding the DNA kit. So tell me again about not being part of this family. Because it looks like you're about to have a lot more family than you bargained for. Dad was staring at mom like he'd never seen her before. 26 years, Linda. 26 years of marriage, and you've been lying about three children. Actually, I said, checking my messages. Make that four. Just got a DNA match notification this morning. Apparently, there's a David from Miami who's also looking for answers. The doorbell rang. Through the window, I could see a young woman with mom's exact nose and chin standing on our porch holding a wrapped present. That'll be Jessica, I said, walking toward the door. I told her we were having a family reunion. Sarah, Finally found her voice. You plan this whole thing? You gave me six months to prepare. After I took that DNA test, I shrug. Did you really think I'd just sit on information this explosive? I opened the door. Jessica, come in. Meet your biological family. Jessica walked in looking exactly like mom did in old photos. Hi, everyone! I'm so excited to finally meet you all. The silence was deafening. Dad was gripping his chair so hard, his knuckles were white. Mom looked like she might faint. Jessica is a pediatric nurse, I announced cheerfully. She brought cookies.

I grew up an army brat. Moving every couple of years was just part of life. By the time I hit high school, I'd already attended more schools than I could count. But somehow I'd managed to stay in one place from eighth grade all the way to junior year. That was the longest stretch of stability I'd ever had. My senior year, though, I knew I'd be moving across the ocean. I was used to leaving friends behind, but honestly, I was looking forward to the change. At the time, I was in the high school band. For my first two years, we had this amazing director and a teacher who was supportive, encouraging, and tough when it mattered. Everyone loved her. But she left, and her replacement was the complete opposite. He was mean, short tempered, and ruled with an iron fist. Nobody liked him, but we all just tolerated it. One afternoon near the end of junior year, I had a dentist appointment. Totally routine, just fixing a cavity before my family's big move. The appointment happened to overlap with band class. I did the responsible thing. I told the director I'd be out. Checked out of school, went to the dentist, and that was that. Or so I thought. The next morning, my bandmate swarmed me. Hey, did you hear what Mister B said yesterday? I hadn't, so they filled me in. Apparently, while I was gone, he launched into a tirade about selfish students who weren't dedicated enough to prioritize. Band went on and on about how people who missed class for trivial things like a medical appointment were ruining the group. 80 kids sat there while he waved his arms and raised his voice, and every single one of them knew exactly who he was talking about. Me. Now, I wasn't a troublemaker. I had a 3.9 GPA. I yes, sir and no, ma'am to adults. I followed rules, but I also had a strong sense of justice. And this. This was unfair. So I marched right up to him and said, I hear you don't want people who schedule appointments during class. Effective immediately, I'm no longer in your band. I'll find another class to finish out the year. His face went beat red, veins bulged. He started shouting that he was the one in charge, that I couldn't leave his class without his permission. But this. It wasn't class time. I didn't have to stand there, so I just walked out. I went to one of my favorite teachers, Coach N, who also taught art history during that same period. I explained the situation, and without hesitation, he said I was welcome to join his class. All I needed was the principal's approval. So I went to the office, explained everything, and the principal said, we need a meeting with my parents and Mister B before making it Official fine by me. That afternoon, though, I was told I had to go back to band until the meeting happened. That's when the malicious compliance kicked in. If Mister B insisted I stay, I'd stay. But on my terms. I walked into band class, sat down in my front row seat. I was first chair oboe. Folded my hands in my lap. I didn't take out my instrument. I didn't touch my music. For 90 minutes, I just sat there silently staring at him. Day two, same thing. No instrument, no music. Just me silently refusing to play. He thought he could break me by threatening my grade. But I already made peace with it. When the meeting finally happened, Mister B tried to push the idea that I needed to stay. He even said smugly, if I don't let you out of my class, you'll fail the principal

Here's the brutal truth I Learned when we spotted my cousin Mike on the local news sleeping under a bridge. Our whole family rushed to help. My sister immediately offered him her spare room, thinking this would solve everything. We were wrong. For two weeks, Mike had everything, warm bed, hot meals, clean clothes. My sister even lined up three easy jobs where he'd start at $18 an hour, but he skipped every interview. I'm not built for that life, he'd say, spending all day sleeping and watching TV. We even offered to let him start by working just three days a week, thinking maybe full time was too much. He still refused. Working is for suckers, he told my sister while eating the dinner she cooked. The breaking point came when my sister caught him selling the new phone she bought him. I like my freedom, he said. A homeless charity put him in a fully furnished apartment next, paying six months rent up front. Within a week, he abandoned it all. Now we see him sometimes panhandling downtown. People will ask why we let him be homeless. Truth is, you can't force someone to want a normal life. We offered him everything, jobs, home, support, but he chose this. Some people would rather live with no responsibilities than work for a living. Last week, he waved at me from his usual spot. He's still there. Cardboard sign In hand, refusing every offer of real help. Sometimes the hardest truth is accepting that you can't help someone who doesn't want to help themselves.

My mom had two rules that she drilled into me since I was 8 years old. Never mention dad to anyone. Never use our real last name. Your dad was a bad man, an evil man. If he finds you, he'll hurt us both, she'd tell me. It confused me because he always seemed friendly. But now, because of him, we were constantly on the run, moving to a new school every year, using a new name, wearing a new personality to match. When I was a bit older, mom explained in detail how dad was in prison for armed robbery, had a family with ties to the cartel, how mom testified against them and was now stuck in witness Protection. It destroyed my social life and made me really hate him. That is, until the real truth came out. I secretly made a fake Instagram account at the school library just to see what normal kids lives look like. While I was scrolling through photos of old friends and classmates, got a message from an account with no picture. Is your mom's name Angeline? My heart stopped. I almost deleted everything right there. But something made me respond. Who are you? I'm your dad. Prove it, I said confidently. When the stranger actually sent me evidence, I felt the entire room spin. According to Mom, Dad was in prison. But this person claiming to be Him managed to send photos I'd never seen before. Me as a baby in his arms. My birth certificate with a completely different last name. Private investigator reports showing he'd been searching for us for eight years. And not a single arrest record. I kept it a secret from mom. Came home acting normal, only to spend time at the library computers again the next day chatting with him. We started having weekly video calls, explaining things little by little. Your mom took you? The day I discovered she'd emptied my business accounts. Told me one afternoon $400,000 meant for employee payroll. She had a gambling problem I've been trying to help her with. When I found out about the theft and started calling the police, she picked you up from school and disappeared. Somehow I believed him. It made more sense than anything mom had been telling me for years. Why didn't you have her arrested? I asked. If I did, she said she'd take you down with her. And that scared me. Dad started tearing up on camera, but all I could think of was what now? One day after school, mom smiled and introduced me to a man with tattoos. This does the kid? He asked in a raspy voice. Yes. Say hi to your Uncle Tony. He's visiting all the way from Vegas. I stared at him, frozen. Something about the sharp suit, Cuban cigar and brass knuckles made my body too weak to say hello. Now go do your homework upstairs. Mom sent me away. I sat upstairs peeking at them from an angle on the stairs where they couldn't see me. I watched them set up cards, pour drinks, laughing. Angeline, I still can't believe you pulled off that 400,000 score from your husband. Tony said mom giggled. Easiest money I ever stole. He was too trusting. That was legendary. Cleaned out his whole construction business, then vanished with the kid. Brilliant. Well, I Learned from the best. Besides, I knew he couldn't do anything. Not if he wanted to.

My parents banned me from learning the local language because they said it would dilute my cultural purity. We moved here when I was 18 months old for dad's job, and 17 years later we were still here, living in an expat bubble where nobody had to interact with locals. My parents sent me to the International Academy, where everything was taught in our language by imported teachers who cost more than most locals made in five years. They genuinely believed learning the local language would erase my heritage and turn me into someone they couldn't recognize, pointing to other expat kids who'd gone native as cautionary tales. I lived in a country where I couldn't talk to 90% of the people. Every interaction outside our bubble required a translator or embarrassing hand gestures that made me look like an idiot tourist. I watched local kids my age hanging out in coffee shops and playing soccer in the park, but I couldn't join them because I literally couldn't communicate beyond pointing and smiling. My parents said this was good because local kids would be a bad influence, teaching me their backward ways and making me forget my superior education. They didn't understand that I had no connection to a homeland I couldn't even remember while being locked out of the only country I'd ever known. When I turned 14, I started secretly learning the language using a phone I bought with birthday Money and hid in my school locker. Every lunch break, I'd sit in the furthest bathroom stall with headphones, work, looking through language apps and watching local shows with subtitles. After two years, I was nearly fluent, but had to pretend I couldn't understand anything around my parents. The hardest part was stopping myself from reacting when people talked about us in public, assuming we couldn't understand their comments about rich foreigners who thought they were too good to integrate. Sometimes locals would say horrible things about my mom's clothes or my dad's attitude while we stood right there, and I had to keep my face complete, completely blank. My whole double life worked perfectly until that Saturday at the imported goods store my parents loved because all the staff spoke our language. We were shopping for Mom's birthday party when a man burst through the entrance waving something metallic that caught the fluorescent lights. He was shouting instructions that made everyone drop to the floor immediately except for us and two other foreign families who just stood there confused. A man's face was covered with a Bandana and his eyes were wild as he pointed his weapon at the cowering cashiers and kept yelling the same phrases over and over. My parents were complete frozen because they had no idea what was happening beyond the obvious threat. Dad actually started walking toward the exit, which made the man spin around and scream directly at him while jabbing the weapon. In his direction. Dad just kept walking because he didn't understand the man was telling him to get on the ground or he'd make an example out of him. And started counting down from five in the local language, his finger moving toward what was clearly a trigger. And my parents just stood there like confused tourists, waiting for someone to translate, get on the ground right now, because he's about to shoot dad! I screamed at my parents in our language while dropping to my knees. The shock on their faces wasn't from the death threat, but from hearing me translate perfectly. Mom's mouth fell open as I rapidly explained that the man wanted everyone's phones in a pile, women's jewelry in a bag, and nobody to look at his face.

You ever meet someone so arrogant that you just know they're gonna hurt themselves? Well, that's exactly what happened when I met this clueless woman at a dog park. I ended up watching her own dog bite her literal arm after she ignored my warnings. I've been a veterinarian for 12 years in Denver, Colorado. That morning, I taken my golden retriever, Max, to Cheeseman Park. The place was packed. Probably 40 dogs running around, kids on the playground nearby, and people doing yoga on the grass. Max was doing his usual thing. Sing every blade of grass like it held the secrets of the universe. That's when I noticed this Jack Russell terrier near the water fountain. Something was clearly off about him. The dog was stumbling slightly. Not the playful tumble of a happy dog, but that distinctive neurological wobble I'd seen too many times in my clinic. Then I saw the foam. Not just a normal dog drool, but thick white foam collecting at the corners of his mouth. The real tell was his eyes, dilated pupils, despite the bright morning sun and this vacant, unfocused stare. When another dog approached to play, the Jack Russell snapped at it. My stomach dropped. They were textbook rabies symptoms, and everyone at the park could potentially be in danger. The owner, this woman in designer workout clothes and pristine white sneakers, was simply scrolling through her phone, completely oblivious. I approached Her carefully keeping Max behind me. Excuse me, is that your Jack Russell? She looked up. Smile proudly. Yes, that's Winston. Isn't he precious? I kept my voice calm, professional. Ma'am, I'm a veterinarian and I'm concerned about your dog. He's showing symptoms that could indicate rabies. We need to get him contained and to an emergency vet immediately. Her face transformed instantly from proud mom to outraged defender. Excuse me, what did you say about my baby? Did you just call him dangerous? I tried again, pulling out my veterinary license from my wallet. Look, I'm a veterinarian. Your dog has neurological symptom, excessive salivation and aggression. When was his last rabies vaccination? She actually laughed. Oh, my god, you're one of those people. Winston is perfectly healthy. He's just excited to be at the park. The phone was getting worse, dripping onto the ground now. Ma'am, please, this is serious. Rabies is fatal. If she cut me off. Voice rising to a shriek that made everyone turn. Oh, please. You're just jealous because my dog is purebred and yours is just some mutt. I know your type. Bitter, judgmental women who can't stand seeing others happy. Now she was making a scene, waving her arms. This crazy woman is harassing me about my dog. She's probably not even a real vet. Other dog owners were starting to stare, some pulling their dogs closer. I showed my license to anyone who'd look. Please, someone help me convince her that Dog is sick. But he kept going louder now. Get away from us! You're ruining our morning. Winston is perfectly fine. Aren't you, baby? She bent down toward the dog, and I saw him tense up. That pre bite body language I knew too well. Don't touch him, I warned. She flip me off. Go away, you psycho! Find someone else to bother with your fake expertise. I walked away, but my years of experience wouldn't just let me leave. Instead, I sat on a bench about 30 feet away, where I could watch them while animal control on my cell. The dispatcher said they'd send someone, but it might take 20 minutes. I kept Max close, my eyes locked on Winston. The woman went back to her phone, occasionally baby talking to her dog, completely unaware he was now growling at shadows. I started recording on my phone, partly for evidence, partly because I knew what was coming. Other dogs instinctively gave Winston a wide birth. Animals know when something's wrong, even

When I tell people my 12 year old daughter only speaks to five people in the entire world, they think I'm exaggerating. I'm not. After what her father did to her? Years of abuse that started when she was barely old enough to form memories. Trust became a foreign concept. She talks to me, her aunt, her grandparents, and her best friend. That's it. Touch her unexpectedly and she might have a panic attack. Ask her a direct question if you're not on that list, and she'll stare at the floor until you give up. Her Nintendo Switch is her lifeline. It's the only place where she feels completely safe, where she has control and where no one can hurt her. She takes it everywhere, clutching it like armor against a world that's already proven it can be cruel. I used to worry about the addiction until her therapist explained it. It's her safe space, her habit. I met Lucas eight months ago. I didn't tell him about Maddie for the first three months, not because I was hiding her, but because I needed to be sure. She'd only met two of my dates in the eight years since her father left, and both times ended in disasters that set her progress back months. The first one tried to high five her. She didn't speak for three days. This second brought her a teddy. Bear and tried to hug her. The panic attack lasted an hour. Lucas was different from the start. When I finally told him about Maddie, about the abuse, about the silence, about the switch that never left her hands, he didn't do what the others did. He didn't say, I'm great with kids or she'll warm up to me. He just said, I'll just follow your lead. We waited another two months before they met. I planned it carefully. A brief encounter at our apartment. No pressure, no expectations. Maddie knew he was coming. She sat on the couch with her switch headphones on, already retreating into her digital world. Lucas walked in, gave her a small wave. She didn't return, and then did something unexpected. He pulled out his own switch and sat in the chair across the room, not next to her, not trying to see her screen, just playing his own game. 20 minutes passed in silence. Then Maddie's head tilted slightly. I saw her glancing at his screen. Another 10 minutes go by and she paused her game. I held my breath. Is that Mario Kart? Her voice was so quiet, I almost missed it. Lucas looked up. Casual as anything. Yeah, the new one. Do you play? She nodded. I'm terrible at Rainbow Road, he said, then went back to playing. Five minutes later, I can beat Rainbow Road. No way. It's impossible. And just like that, my silent daughter was offended enough to speak. Again, it's not impossible. I have three stars on every cup. Lucas paused his game, looking genuinely impressed. Every cup? Even 200 C C? She actually sat up straighter. Especially 200 C C. Prove it. I watched stunned as Maddie scooted to the edge of the couch, not closer to him. She maintained that careful distance, but engaged. We could race online. They exchanged friend codes without ever leaving their separate spaces. For the next hour, they played Mario Kart together while sitting eight feet apart. Maddie didn't just play, she trash talked. You're about to eat my dust, she muttered after selecting her character when she won the first race. She actually smiled when Lucas Blue shelled her on the third lap.

For three years straight. Danny would act surprised when my birthday rolled around. First year he said work was crazy and he'd make it up to me. Second year he claimed his phone died so he lost track of dates. Last year he literally asked me why I seemed upset on February 15th like he had no clue it was the day after my birthday. Meanwhile, this guy remembered every sports stat from 1995 and could tell you exactly when his favorite show aired. Each week he had phone reminders for oil changes, dentist appointments, even when to water his plants. But somehow my birthday was this impossible thing to keep track of. My friends kept telling me to just remind him or send hints, but that felt pathetic. If some no one cares about you, they remember what matters to you without being nagged about it. This year I decided to test something two weeks before my birthday. I started dropping hints everywhere. I left my birth certificate on the kitchen counter. I circled February 14th on the calendar with a big red heart. I even mentioned it during dinner. My birthday is coming up soon, I said while we ate tacos. He just nodded and kept scrolling his phone. The week before I got more obvious. I showed him a dress online and said this would be perfect for my birthday dinner next week. He mumbled something about It being nice and went back to watching TV. Three days before, I literally said, so what are we doing for my birthday Thursday? He looked confused and asked, what's Thursday? When I told him it was my birthday, he slapped his forehead like he always did and said, right, yeah. I've been so busy with work stuff. Thursday morning came. I woke up expecting something. Anything. Maybe flowers by my bedside or breakfast in bed. Nothing. He got dressed, kissed my cheek, and said he'd be back late because of a client dinner. Not even a happy birthday. I sat there in my pajamas until noon, feeling stupid for hoping things would be different this year. Then I remembered something. His birthday was exactly one month later, March 14th. And for the past four years, I'd thrown him surprise parties, bought expensive gifts, took days off work to plan special celebrations. That's when I made my decision. I spent my actual birthday doing something I'd never done before. I went shopping alone, bought myself the exact dress I'd shown him, got my nails done, and treated myself to dinner at this fancy Italian place downtown. The waiter even brought me free cake when I mentioned it was my birthday. For the next month, every time Danny mentioned his upcoming birthday, I played dumb. When he showed me golf clubs online and said, the this would be perfect for my birthday, I just said, cool and kept folding laundry. When he Asked what restaurant we should book for his birthday dinner, I told him I hadn't really thought about it. When he mentioned taking the day off work to celebrate, I said that sounded nice and changed the subject. March 14th arrived. I woke up early, got dressed for work like any normal day, and started making coffee. Danny came downstairs in his favorite shirt, really expecting something special. Morning, I said, not looking up from my phone. It's my birthday, he said, waiting for my reaction. I looked up, pretended to think for a second, then snapped my fingers. Oh yeah! Happy birthday, babe! Have a good day at work. His face went through about five different emotions. Confusion, hurt, anger, then this weird panic. That's it? You're not taking the day off? We don't have dinner plans? I shrugged, grabbing my keys. I've been super busy with work stuff lately. Haven't really had time to plan anything. When I got home that night, he was sitting at the kitchen table, looking defeated. You really forgot my birthday? He said quietly. I didn't forget, I replied. I just figured if birthdays aren't important enough to remember without reminders, then maybe we shouldn't make such a big deal about them. The realization hit him like a truck. His mouth opened and closed a few times before he finally said, this is about your birthday, isn't it? What about my birthday? I asked innocently. He put his head in his hands. I been A complete idiot. Yeah, I said. You have been. The next morning, I woke up to rose petals leading from our bedroom to the kitchen, where he'd made my favorite breakfast and had a jewelry box sitting next to my coffee.

For three years straight. Danny would act surprised when my birthday rolled around. First year he said work was crazy and he'd make it up to me. Second year he claimed his phone died so he lost track of dates. Last year he literally asked me why I seemed upset on February 15th like he had no clue it was the day after my birthday. Meanwhile, this guy remembered every sports stat from 1995 and could tell you exactly when his favorite show aired. Each week he had phone reminders for oil changes, dentist appointments, even when to water his plants. But somehow my birthday was this impossible thing to keep track of. My friends kept telling me to just remind him or send hints, but that felt pathetic. If some no one cares about you, they remember what matters to you without being nagged about it. This year I decided to test something two weeks before my birthday. I started dropping hints everywhere. I left my birth certificate on the kitchen counter. I circled February 14th on the calendar with a big red heart. I even mentioned it during dinner. My birthday is coming up soon, I said while we ate tacos. He just nodded and kept scrolling his phone. The week before I got more obvious. I showed him a dress online and said this would be perfect for my birthday dinner next week. He mumbled something about It being nice and went back to watching TV. Three days before, I literally said, so what are we doing for my birthday Thursday? He looked confused and asked, what's Thursday? When I told him it was my birthday, he slapped his forehead like he always did and said, right, yeah. I've been so busy with work stuff. Thursday morning came. I woke up expecting something. Anything. Maybe flowers by my bedside or breakfast in bed. Nothing. He got dressed, kissed my cheek, and said he'd be back late because of a client dinner. Not even a happy birthday. I sat there in my pajamas until noon, feeling stupid for hoping things would be different this year. Then I remembered something. His birthday was exactly one month later, March 14th. And for the past four years, I'd thrown him surprise parties, bought expensive gifts, took days off work to plan special celebrations. That's when I made my decision. I spent my actual birthday doing something I'd never done before. I went shopping alone, bought myself the exact dress I'd shown him, got my nails done, and treated myself to dinner at this fancy Italian place downtown. The waiter even brought me free cake when I mentioned it was my birthday. For the next month, every time Danny mentioned his upcoming birthday, I played dumb. When he showed me golf clubs online and said, the this would be perfect for my birthday, I just said, cool and kept folding laundry. When he Asked what restaurant we should book for his birthday dinner, I told him I hadn't really thought about it. When he mentioned taking the day off work to celebrate, I said that sounded nice and changed the subject. March 14th arrived. I woke up early, got dressed for work like any normal day, and started making coffee. Danny came downstairs in his favorite shirt, really expecting something special. Morning, I said, not looking up from my phone. It's my birthday, he said, waiting for my reaction. I looked up, pretended to think for a second, then snapped my fingers. Oh yeah! Happy birthday, babe! Have a good day at work. His face went through about five different emotions. Confusion, hurt, anger, then this weird panic. That's it? You're not taking the day off? We don't have dinner plans? I shrugged, grabbing my keys. I've been super busy with work stuff lately. Haven't really had time to plan anything. When I got home that night, he was sitting at the kitchen table, looking defeated. You really forgot my birthday? He said quietly. I didn't forget, I replied. I just figured if birthdays aren't important enough to remember without reminders, then maybe we shouldn't make such a big deal about them. The realization hit him like a truck. His mouth opened and closed a few times before he finally said, this is about your birthday, isn't it? What about my birthday? I asked innocently. He put his head in his hands. I been A complete idiot. Yeah, I said. You have been. The next morning, I woke up to rose petals leading from our bedroom to the kitchen, where he'd made my favorite breakfast and had a jewelry box sitting next to my coffee. Inside was a necklace that looked exactly like my mom's missing one. I know I can't undo the past three years, he said, but I swear I will never forget again.

The speed that you're traveling, by the time you actually hit the water, it will be the same as if you were hitting concrete. This is called surface tension. Purpose tension is the reason why Olympic swimming pools have little sprinklers shooting into the water. It rattles up the water a little bit, allowing the divers to enter the water like this instead of like this. And I don't know about you, but regardless of how much I know about surface tension, it still seems like if my parachute malfunctions, I should still aim for the water. But no. Surface tension. Science, blah blah blah. However, regardless of how annoying surface tension is, without it, our lives would be miserable. How so? Let me explain. Imagine you're walking through your apartment with a glass of water. You trip and fall and spill the glass of water on the floor, creating a puddle. Surface tension is the reason why the puddle of water is only this big and not this big covering every surface area of ground on your apartment floor. Literally without surface tension, if you spilled a glass of water on the floor, it would travel all over the floor about two microns deep. Meaning every time you spilled water, it would literally be impossible to clean all of it up.

I responded, bros before hoes, but moms before all. And everyone cracked up. Jason didn't smile, though. His face drained of color like I just confessed to murder. He grabbed all his stuff and moved 3 rows up the school bus without a word. Jason, what's wrong? I was just kidding. I called after him, but he wouldn't turn around. That's when I heard it stay. See, my girlfriend's best friend was crying her eyes out in the back row. When I turned to look, her friend whispered urgently in her ear and she glanced at me before crying harder. Okay, hey, that was definitely weird. I started to wonder whether my joke was really that offensive. That's when my phone buzzed. Three missed calls from dad, but there was no signal. And at the red light, I caught the bus driver wiping his eyes in the rearview mirror. In my three years of knowing him, the most emotion he'd shown was mild annoyance when kids left trash on the seats. A cold feeling crept into my stomach. I got up to go talk to Jason, but Missus Unfitzharris blocked the aisle. Sit down. We're moving. I just need to sit down. I'd never heard her voice like that. I sat. But the second we got to the destination, I cornered Jason. Dude, what is going On he backed away. Nothing. I just, I need space, bro. I was just kidding. I, I don't know if I'd pick my mom or my girlfriend. Why did you have to tell everyone what I said? Sid appeared out of nowhere and pulled me aside. Our team captain who never said more than pass the ball to me, grabbed my shoulders. Bro, if you need to talk about anything, I'm here. About what? I was almost shouting now. He just squeezed my shoulder and walked away. That cold feeling in my stomach was spreading. During the water break, Ryan shuffled over. This kid didn't even know my name. Yo. The blonde Kaylee from volleyball thinks you're cute. She's single now, too. The words hit like a punch. Dude, what the hell? I flashed him my lock screen. I have a girlfriend. His face went white. Just trying to help you move forward, man. Move forward. From what? I practically ran away. I tried calling my girlfriend Isabella on the public landline right then straight to voicemail. I must have called 15 times. I was losing my mind. Everyone felt so bad for me that no one even forced me back on the field to play. As soon as lunch hit, I grabbed Jason more aggressively this time. Tell me what's happening now. I can't. He was typing frantically in his notes app. You can't or you won't. His girlfriend Ava read over his shoulder then slapped him hard. How Could you not tell him, you coward? She stormed off. Jason, did something happen to Isabella? He wouldn't look at me, just kept typing. That's when Stacy walked by. She saw me and her face twisted with rage. You never deserved a girl like Usabella. I always told her she deserved better. Her friend clamped a hand over her mouth and dragged her away. My head was spinning. I stumbled to the vending machines where the coaches were arguing. He has a right to know now, Miss. As a Griffin hissed. There's no point. The decision has already been made. Mrs. Fitzharris shot back. Somebody tell me what's happening, I shouted. They scattered like roaches. It wasn't until the bus ride back that Jason spoke to me again. By that.

I discovered my wife was cheating when the kids mentioned Uncle Steve have been helping Mommy feel better at night. The betrayal hurt worse than anything I'd ever felt, but I knew staying would destroy me, so I filed for divorce. During the proceedings, I practically begged her to be reasonable about custody, look me in the eyes and said I would never keep your children from you. For six months, she actually kept her word and we fell into this decent routine where we'd exchange the kids every Friday without any drama. She'd even text me little updates about their school days and we managed to sit together at their soccer games like normal divorced parents. But then I pulled up for my regular Friday pickup and there was a for sale sign in the yard and the house was completely empty. I actually fell to my knees on their lawn because I knew she'd done it. She'd actually taken my kids. I called her phone over and over, but it just rang. When I gave up, I noticed the notification for a voicemail that came at 6:00am. Her voice was casual, saying we've relocated to Seattle for Steve's job and the kids are already enrolled in school. Like she was telling me about changing their soccer practice time. I sat in that driveway for an hour dissociating because she'd been planning on moving 3,000 miles away. For months while looking me in the eye every Friday, The next morning a process server handed me court papers claiming I was an absent father who prioritized work over my children. And I realized she'd also been documenting my business trips, kept calling and texting, begging to just hear my kids voices. It actually took 3 days for me to get through to her. She answered and instead of explaining anything, she offered monthly video calls like she was being generous. I accepted and she passed the phone to my 8 year old. He cried instantly. Why can't we see you this weekend? My ex immediately answered, daddy's too busy with work. Then hung up on me. My calls wouldn't go through after that and she texted that I had just used up my call for the month. I was so pissed and refused to let her get away with this. So the next week I liquidated my entire 4 o one k to pay a lawyer who told me I was fighting an uphill battle, but at least we could try. I quit my traveling job that I'd worked so hard for and the local position making 40% less. All this was to show the court I was prioritizing my children. Every other weekend I maxed out credit cards to fly to Seattle and my kids would run to me in the airport like I was returning from war. We spent weekends in cramped hotel rooms making blanket Forts and eating McDonald's because that's all I could afford. But they didn't care because we were together. Those weekends were perfect until Sunday drop offs when my ex would make sure to say things in front of me like, daddy doesn't live here. This is just vacation. Remember that your dad is Steve now. I just smile through it while documenting every text where she denied me extra time. After two years of never missing a single visit, the judge finally granted me a week each summer. And when my kids got older, they started asking why mom lied so much about me. I was glad they didn't fall for her lies, especially because she couldn't even acknowledge how hard she made all of this. But her karma came a year later. My phone rang at midnight and when I heard her crying, I almost hung up because I didn't want to deal with her drama.

I refused. And the next day before I left, I found them tearing up my lottery ticket, laughing because I'm envious. But I laughed my head off because that ticket was fake. See, I saw this coming from a mile away. My sister Ruby has always been the golden child and my parents have always made me give her everything. When I got my first job at 16, they made me give Ruby half my paycheck to teach me about sharing. When grandma left me her ring, they gave it to Ruby because she'll get more use out of it. Every birthday, every achievement, every moment of my life, Ruby had to get equal or more. So when I won, I knew they'd pull this exact stunt. The moment I told them, I could see the wheels turning in their heads. Dad immediately launched into his speech about family responsibility while Ruby sat there with that smug smile she gets when she's about to take something that's mine. That night, after they delivered their ultimatum, I heard them whispering in the kitchen, she'll cave, Ruby said confidently. She always does. Mom agreed, saying, I'd never actually leave because I'm too dependent on family. They had no idea they were dealing with someone who'd finally had enough. I spent all night creating a perfect day. Fake ticket. I Work in graphic design, so I knew exactly how to make it look authentic. Same paper, texture, same fonts, everything. The only difference, completely different numbers. That definitely hadn't won anything. I made sure it looked slightly worn, like I've been carrying it around since the drawing. Meanwhile, the real ticket was safely locked in my bank's safety deposit box, already verified and ready for claim. The next morning, I acted devastated. I came to breakfast looking like I've been crying all night. Fine, I said quietly. I'll pack and leave today. I made sure to accidentally leave the fake ticket in my wallet on the kitchen counter. When I went upstairs to pack, the bait was set. Sure enough, 20 minutes later, I heard screaming from downstairs. Amelia, get down here now. Dad's voice was shaking with rage. I walked down to find all three of them huddled around my wallet. The torn pieces of the fake ticket scattered across the counter like confetti. How does it feel now? Ruby laughed, holding up a piece of the the ticket. No lottery money for you. Maybe next time you'll think about what family means. Mom was nodding approvingly. This is what happens when you choose greed over family. Amelia, Dad crossed his arms. Hopefully this teaches you a lesson about sharing. I just stood there a moment, taking it all in. Then I started laughing, quietly at first, then louder. You're absolutely right, I said, still chuckling. That ticket was Completely worthless. Their triumphant expression started to alter. Something in my tone wasn't matching their expectations. I pulled out my phone and opened my banking app, making sure the screen was facing them. 1, 847 30, 329, 18, deposited yesterday at three forty seven PM the silence that followed was deafening. Ruby's mouth literally fell open. Mom grabbed the counter to study herself. Dad just stared at my phone screen like it was showing him a ghost. The real ticket was never in my wallet, I continued calmly. It's been in my bank safety deposit box since the day after I won. That piece of garbage you just tore up, I made it last night specifically for you to find. Ruby's face went from pale to bright red. You, you tricked us. You tricked yourselves. I replied. I just gave you enough rope to hang yourselves with. And boy, did you ever. Amelia, wait, mom started her voice suddenly much. We can work this out. We were just trying to teach you. Teach me what? I interrupted that my own family would destroy what they thought was my future out of spite. Message received loud and clear. Dad tried his authoritative voice. Now hold on just a minute. We're still your parents and, and you just prove that means absolutely nothing to you when money is involved. Ruby was getting desperate. Now, Amelia, come on. We're family. Families fight, but they work things out, right? I mean, we can share The money now, can't we? 50 50, just like we originally talked about. I grabbed my keys from the counter. You're right, Ruby. That ticket you destroyed was worthless, just like this family apparently is. As I I headed for the door, I heard Ruby screaming behind me. You can't just leave. We're your family. You owe us, Amelia. But I was already in my car, driving away to my new life, a life where I'd never again have to pretend that blood relation means more than basic human decency. Ruby's still calling and texting every day, begging for another chance, and I don't answer. Some lessons are permanent. The best part, I'm happier now than I've ever been. Turns out, when you remove toxic people from your life, even winning the lottery feels like the smaller victory.

I was lucky enough to have my daughter in my class when she got to ninth grade, but also had another kid who would constantly bug her. He was always trying to flirt with the girls in my class, which ended with them slapping him on numerous different occasions. I sent him to the office so many times that he had to sit in the front, but one day he practically begged me to sit in the back. I don't know why, but I said yes. We were in the middle of an assignment, and our entire class was silent when at one point, I could hear whispering coming from the back. I looked up, and all I saw was him showing another student what, at first glance, looked like a handgun. It honestly took me a second to process what I had just seen. I didn't have a clear enough view to be sure, and I just sat there trying to stay calm. I knew I had to get a better look, so I stood up to go help one of my students. Now I was sure it wasn't a toy. It was real. I remember my sweat literally dripping off my face and tried my hardest not to pass out. My hands were shaking like crazy while I dialed 9 1 1 on my phone, but it was too quiet to say Anything. Couldn't just walk out of the room. I had to keep my students safe and knew I had to get my daughter out of there. I texted our assistant principal in all caps exactly what I had just seen, and waited minutes for a response. Eventually, I knew I couldn't wait, so I called that same girl over to my desk. I wrote her a note that said, ask me to use the bathroom. Go get the assistant principal, get him to check his phone and leave. The school immediately tried to keep a calm look on my face, but she could see something was horribly wrong. She left without saying anything, and I tried to act like everything was normal. Five excruciating minutes later, he knocked on the door. He walked inside and started chatting with a few students, acting as if nothing was wrong. I think they started to catch on something was going on, too, and eventually, he asked the boy to come out into the hall with him. He stood up, and those few seconds as he walked by my daughter to the door were the most terrifying of my life. As soon as he stepped out, he was tackled to the ground. Apparently, he was planning to use it on another student that lunch. And since then, I homeschool my daughter.

So my sister has been having kids since she was basically a teenager. She got pregnant at 18, married her boyfriend because both sets of parents pushed it. And now at 29, she's got five kids, 11, 6, 3, 2 and 1. And now she's pregnant again. Close with our parents, so we have family dinners a lot. And every single time she starts in on the same routine, how her life sucks, how her body is ruined, how she can't get surgery, how she never has money, never gets time for herself, how no one will watch her kids. It's constant. Her husband works all the time and can't stand her, so she just dumps it all on us. And honestly, her kids are wild. Sitting through those dinners feels like surviving a war zone. What pisses me off is that none of this was forced on her. Our parents gave us the talk at 16, gave us birth control, told us to focus on school and careers before starting families. She wanted a baby at 18. She kept choosing to have kid after kid. She had options. She ignored all of them. So Christmas rolls around and sure enough, she's sitting there with her pity party going on and on about how I don't understand because I've got a degree, a good job, a boyfriend, no kids, can afford to go to the gym. I get to live life. While she's trapped and I just snapped. I told her to shut the fuck up. I told her she's in this mess because she's a moron who made terrible choices and nobody feels sorry for her. My brother started laughing. My parents stayed quiet, which says a lot because behind her back, they complain about her all the time too. And she lost it. Now she's crying on Facebook, making sad TikToks about how society hates mothers and where's her village? And even my family doesn't care about me. But the truth is she built this life herself and I'm done.

She returned 6 years later to find I'd divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years, Max. Don't change the locks. He left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation. To our eight year olds, that first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home, and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decisions. No more walking on eggshells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curveball in our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year two brought unexpected changes. Without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I'd been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd forgotten how To enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually, she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her bonus mom. Their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes, and tucked them in at night. Year five was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and. And being the mom who stayed, there wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year six, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward. After Three years of zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from the living room. Through the window, we watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she owned the place.

I was at my girlfriend's family dinner when her dad announced I had to participate in their family tradition for new boyfriends. What started as a simple test became the longest night of my life. I've been dating her for six months. She finally invited me to Sunday dinner with her parents. I was nervous, but excited to make a good impression. I brought flowers for her mom and wore my nicest shirt. Everything was going perfectly. Her mom was sweet, asking about my job and college plans. Her dad seemed friendly enough, talking about sports and making jokes. I was starting to relax when he suddenly got serious. We have a family tradition, he announced after we finished eating. Every boyfriend who wants to keep dating my daughter has to pass a little test. I laughed nervously. What kind of test? Nothing too crazy, he said with a smile that didn't reach his eyes. Just proves you're serious about her. My girlfriend looked uncomfortable but didn't say anything. Her mom kept clearing dishes like nothing was happening. I figured it would be some harmless dad joke or maybe answering relationship questions. Her dad disappeared into the kitchen and came back with a small glass filled with dark liquid. He set it in front of me with Ceremony. Family hot sauce, he explained. Made it myself with special ingredients. Every boyfriend drinks a shot to join the Family. The smell hit me immediately. It was like someone had liquefied pure fire and mixed it with vinegar. My eyes started watering just from being near it. Dad. My girlfriend started, but he held up his hand. Tradition is tradition. Unless he's too weak to handle a little spice. I looked around the table. Everyone was watching me like this was completely normal. I picked up the glass and took the shot. The pain was instant and overwhelming. My mouth felt like it was melting. Tears streamed down my face as I tried not to show how much it hurt. But I made it through. Good. Her dad nodded. But that was just the first test.

Expensive cars in the driveway and uniformed people walking around. This is where you grew up? I asked. She nodded, but looked embarrassed. This is why I don't talk about family stuff. Inside was even crazier. Three story ceiling, paintings that looked like they belonged in museums. Furniture you see in magazines. Her dad came out to meet us. Nice guy, but wearing a watch that probably cost more than I make in six months. He talked about family business like it was no big deal. Her mom showed me photos from their newest business location. Over these. During dinner cooked by a chef, her little brother complained about his sports car being in the shop. Her sister was planning some charity event. And there I was thinking, my girlfriend worked at a coffee shop to pay rent. After we went to bed in their guest room, bigger than my entire apartment. I asked her why. She never told me. She said her last boyfriend only stayed with her once he found out about the money. He kept asking her to buy him stuff and pay for expensive trips. Made her feel like a credit card to. When we met. You never tried to impress me with money or ask me to pay for Things you liked me for who I am, not what my family has. So I wanted to keep it that way.

She always wanted to split bills, wore simple clothes, drove this old car that made weird noises. When we went out, it was usually cheap places or free stuff, like hiking. Her apartment was tiny, one bedroom with yard sale furniture. She worked part time at a coffee shop and talked about saving money for rent. I felt bad because I made more than her, but she insisted on paying her own way. She never mentioned family much. They lived across the country and she didn't see them often. When I asked about holidays, she changed the subject. Then one day she got this phone call that changed everything. We were watching movies when her phone rang. She looked at the caller ID and went completely white. I have to take this, she said, walking into the bathroom. I could hear her talking through the door. Something about lawyers and dad. I already told you I don't want any part of this. When she came out, she looked really upset. Everything okay? I asked. Was quiet for a long time. Finally she said, my family situation is complicated. There's stuff I haven't told you. My dad wants me to come home for this business thing. He says it's important and I can't keep avoiding it. What kind of business? She looked at Me like she was deciding whether to tell the truth. He owns some companies. Like a lot of companies. The next week, she asked if I wanted to meet her parents. She seemed nervous. Kept saying they were different and I shouldn't judge her. We flew first class, which seemed weird because she always acted like money was tight when I mentioned it. Said her dad booked the tickets. At the airport, there was a guy in a suit holding a sign with her name. Not a taxi driver, but an actual chauffeur with an expensive black car.

I became a parent at 7 years old, the day I realized my sister Eve would starve if I didn't learn to cook. Our parents worked 18 hour days and treated the office like their real home, while I Learned to pack Eve's lunch in the specific blue container she needed and her sandwiches into perfect triangles. By 9, I could forge their signatures perfectly and knew exactly how to calm her meltdowns. By 16, I scheduled her doctor visits and set alarms to give her medicine on time. Eve would fall asleep by the front door waiting for them to come home, rocking with her weighted blanket. And I'd carry her to bed at midnight, whispering that I'd always be there, even if they weren't. So when Stanford accepted me, I stared at the letter, knowing I couldn't leave her alone for two more years of high school. She caught me crying and grabbed my shoulders. You have to go. I don't like when you're sad, she said, rocking slightly. Parents suddenly appeared when they heard Stanford's name, actually proud for once and lecturing me about opportunities I couldn't pass up. But I told them I couldn't leave Eve alone, not when she needed someone who understood her routines and could advocate for her at school. For the first time in years, they actually look at me, and I watched something break in Mom's face. Oh, god, she whispered. You've been doing our job since second grade. All this time working to afford the best life for you two, and we haven't even been here to live it with you. Dad couldn't look at me when he finally spoke. Starting tomorrow, being here comes first. And for three beautiful months, they became the best parents. Dad Learned Eve's morning routine, mom attended parent teacher conferences, and they both showed up to her sophomore year orientation. Eve called me at Stanford listing every dinner detail they used. The smooth plates. Dad didn't mix her foods. Mom turned the TV volume to 16, not 17. They and photos of themselves at her art showcase. And Eve's smile in those pictures made the homesickness worth it. She even called one night. Very serious. I have a boyfriend, mom, and dad like him. He helps me at school. I felt grateful hearing her sound happy about normal teenage things. But when I came home two years later for her graduation, I realized she was living anything but a normal.

I responded. I felt like a terrible friend for canceling so last minute, but I had no choice. Are you freaking serious right now? What will everyone think when my best friend isn't at my party? You have to come, Bianca. My granddad's dying. I kept it private, my gosh, she interrupted. Now you're making my birthday about you? My parents literally spent $9,000 on party supplies alone. Just admit you're jealous that you're broke and I'm turning 21 first. Luckily, I had AirPods in, so my granddad couldn't hear her BS, and I hung up. She started spamming me with texts that were even worse than her call, but I felt like a petty hoe that day, so I made a group chat of our entire friend group without her and sent every screenshot. Mia called immediately. Babe, I'm so sorry about your granddad. Also, Bianca's cancelled. But listen, I have an idea that's downright evil.

The fifteen thousand dollar graduation trip to Europe I sent for Diego three months ago. The silence was deafening. My mom started fidgeting with her new designer purse, the one that mysteriously appeared last month along with matching shoes. My dad's gold chain suddenly felt heavier around his neck.

The kitchen renovation. Dad's new motorcycle sitting in our driveway. They'd stolen my graduation gift and spent it on themselves like it was Christmas morning. My sister Estania, who never worked a day in her life, was wearing earrings that cost more than my monthly gas station salary. Diamond studs that sparkled under the restaurant lights. She. I couldn't even look up from her plate, too busy admiring her fresh manicure. You gave them everything their entire lives, I said quietly, my voice shaking with years of suppressed anger. And they took The one thing meant for me. The one thing I actually earned. Grandma stood up, her chair scraping against the floor loud enough to make nearby diners turn. 20 years I've watched you favor Estania over Diego like he's invisible. I sent that money specifically for him. With a letter explaining every detail of the trip I planned. My mom's face went white as paper. We never got a letter, I swear. Because you threw it away after cashing the check that had his name on it. The restaurant felt silent, despite other diners around us. Even the waiters seemed to sense the drama unfolding at our table. I couldn't hold back anymore. This explains everything. Why you suddenly had money for mom's Botox appointments and weekly spa days.

My teacher said my generation was lazy, so I made him eat every word in front of everyone. Mister Hughes never missed a chance to remind us we were the worst generation he taught. Every late assignment, every yawn, every phone check ended the same way. Your generation wants everything handed to you without working for it. It's young. Every single time. I knew plenty of kids who worked hard, but Mister Hughes's words made me wonder if maybe I was just making excuses for being tired. Things changed during spring semester. Mister Hughes walked into class carrying a stack of applications. District's hardship scholarship applications are now open, he announced, waving the papers. Finally, something that rewards real hard work instead of participation. He set them on his desk. $20,000 for a student. You actually understand sacrifice? After class, I lingered by my locker and overheard him talking to Ivan in the hallway. You should definitely apply, Mister Hughes was saying. Your dedication to the team, staying after practice, weekend training camps. That's the kind of sacrifice they're looking for. Ivan mumbled something about other kids probably needing it more. At least some of you understand sacrifice, Mister Michew's replied loudly, glancing at those of us still in the hallway. Not everyone can say that. When they walked away, I quietly went back and took an application from his desk. I started Keeping evidence in secret. Every paycheck from the gas station, every time card from the restaurant, every online tutoring receipt. Took photos on my phone. Created spreadsheets. Tracked every hour. Meanwhile, Mister Hughes was busy mentoring Ivan, this star athlete who stayed after school for extra credit. He'd constantly praise him in class. Now here's someone who understands dedication. Some people put in effort. Others just complain about being tired. Always looking right at me when he said it. What made it worse was that other

I delivered pizza to the same woman every night for three weeks before I finally realized that she was being murdered. She placed the exact same online order at six PM every day like clockwork. Medium pepperoni with extra cheese and one bottle of Coke. And she always included special instructions. That seemed way too personal for a pizza order. While I was trying to deliver smiles and the familiar comfort of a fresh baked pie, I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something horribly wrong in apartment 5D. At first her notes seemed innocent enough, saying things like have a blessed day or stay safe out there, which was actually pretty sweet compared to most customers. After two weeks of these daily deliveries, though, I realized something that made my skin crawl. The first letter of each word spelled out something completely different. One day it said hope everything looks perfect, which spelled help, and I thought maybe I was imagining things. The next day it said hurry up, Robert, terrific service, which spelled H U R T S. And I knew this wasn't a coincidence anymore because my name is actually Jeremy. This woman was trying to tell me something without being able to say it out loud. When I really looked at her for the first time, instead of just going through the motions, she seemed like she was dying in front of Me! Her skin had this grayish tint that reminded me of my grandfather before his kidneys failed and her hands shook so bad she could barely hold the pizza box. The special instructions kept getting more desperate with messages like drivers appreciate your service spelling D A Y S, which confused me until the next one said love every favorite topping spelling left and I realized she was telling me how much time she had. Another said seriously amazing various experiences spelling S A V E and many employees spelling M E. But what really convinced me was when she started writing on the cash tips.

Dad suddenly became fascinated with cutting his ham into impossibly small pieces. Camilla, Honey, Aunt Matilda said slowly, like she was explaining something to a child, your grandmother left you $50,000. I was there when she signed the will.

My voice came out as a whisper, but it might as well have been a scream. You took Grandma's money while I was eating dollar store ramen and stealing toilet paper from more bathrooms. Mom's hands started trembling. We were going to tell you, sweetheart. We just. We had bills. The mortgage was underwater, and your father's business. Your business.

Mister Hopkins stood at the classroom door with a plastic bin, his face completely expressionless as he pointed at my pocket. Phones now no exceptions. Everyone looked depressed as we dropped our entire lives into a bin. Some kids literally having to pry their fingers open to let them go. The announcement from the day before still rang in my ears. Due to inappropriate use of phones during school hours, all students will be handing them in for first period. Nobody would tell us exactly what happened, but rumors spread that some seniors have been airdropping inappropriate photos around the school. But instead of punishing those specific students, the administration decided every single one of us needed to suffer. As I dropped my phone into the bin, I could feel its weight leaving my hand, knowing I wouldn't see it again for eight hours. Every morning, we'd shuffle into first period like prisoners, watching our phones disappear into those bins that got wheeled away to the office. Kids who relied on their phones for medical alerts had to wear special wristbands. Anyone caught with a phone faced immediate suspension, no questions asked. Everyone hated the rule so much, they tried to rebel, saying it was causing safety concerns. Kids were missing important family texts, job callbacks. One girl, Melissa, didn't find out her mom was in the hospital until four hours after the accident cause she couldn't check her messages. Parents were Furious. But the principal kept insisting this would help us focus on education without digital distractions. She even had posters made. Disconnect or reconnect with a picture of students laughing together, which was ironic, since most of us were miserable. That's when I remembered the ancient iPhone 6 buried in my closet drawer.

I became a parent at 7 years old, the day I realized my sister Eve would starve if I didn't learn to cook. Our parents worked 18 hour days and treated the office like their real home, while I Learned to pack Eve's lunch in the specific blue container she needed and her sandwiches into perfect triangles. By 9, I could forge their signatures perfectly and knew exactly how to calm her meltdowns. By 16, I scheduled her doctor visits and set alarms to give her medicine on time. Eve would fall asleep by the front door waiting for them to come home, rocking with her weighted blanket. And I'd carry her to bed at midnight, whispering that I'd always be there, even if they weren't. So when Stanford accepted me, I stared at the letter, knowing I couldn't leave her alone for two more years of high school. She caught me crying and grabbed my shoulders. You have to go. I don't like when you're sad, she said, rocking slightly. Parents suddenly appeared when they heard Stanford's name, actually proud for once and lecturing me about opportunities I couldn't pass up. But I told them I couldn't leave Eve alone, not when she needed someone who understood her routines and could advocate for her at school. For the first time in years, they actually look at me, and I watched something break in Mom's face. Oh, god, she whispered. You've been doing our job since second grade. All this time working to afford the best life for you two, and we haven't even been here to live it with you. Dad couldn't look at me when he finally spoke. Starting tomorrow, being here comes first. And for three beautiful months, they became the best parents. Dad Learned Eve's morning routine, mom attended parent teacher conferences, and they both showed up to her sophomore year orientation. Eve called me at Stanford listing every dinner detail they used. The smooth plates. Dad didn't mix her foods. Mom turned the TV volume to 16, not 17. They and photos of themselves at her art showcase. And Eve's smile in those pictures made the homesickness worth it. She even called one night. Very serious. I have a boyfriend, mom, and dad like him. He helps me at school. I felt grateful hearing her sound happy about normal teenage things. But when I came home two years later for her graduation, I realized she was living anything but a normal.

My parents had one rule that was slowly killing me for years. I never knew what sugar tasted like until I was 11 years old. Not even the natural kind in apples or carrots. Every day I ate boiled chicken breast with no seasoning, steamed broccoli, plain white rice and filtered water that tasted like air. I thought this was normal until I started kindergarten. Other kids had colourful lunch boxes filled with sandwiches and fruit and little bags of crackers. My lunch was always in glass containers because plastic could leak chemicals. Plain chicken cut into cubes, raw cauliflower, a thermos of that special filtered water my mom bought from a medical supply company. The other kids would stare at my lunch and told me about seasoned food, just like a white person. One girl named Selena offered me a grape once and I almost cried. I wanted it so badly. But I knew my parents would somehow smell but off my breath. By second grade, I was sick all the time. My head hurt constantly and the teacher would have to shake my shoulder because I'd fallen asleep sitting up. My stomach cramped after every meal and I spent most of recess in the bathroom. The school called my parents multiple times, but they said I just had a weak immune system. Some children are more delicate. My mom would tell the teacher, we're doing everything we can. At home, they weren't lying about that part. Our house looked like a medical facility. Air purifiers in every room, special water filters. All our food came from one specific organic farm that my parents trusted. They spent thousands of dollars every month on supplements that were supposed to make me stronger. But I kept getting worse. By fourth grade, I was balding. And I could barely read because the words would blur together. I had this weird smell that followed me everywhere, like rotten fruit.

My skin was basically a minefield of cystic acne, blackheads, and scars from picking. London skin glowed like she had a filter on in real life. She made me wait outside the bathroom every morning while she did her 45 minute skincare routine, straightening already perfect hair while I stood there with toothpaste dripping down my chin. When guys came over to study, she'd parade rue in her cutest outfits, telling them about my pizza face and how I used to eat glue in kindergarten. Natural beauty can't be bought, she'd tell her parents when I complained about needing dermatology appointment. Paris needs to learn that personality matters more than looks. The worst part? She'd leave her expensive products all over the bathroom. Half used bottles of retinol and vitamin C serums. She'd abandon then for the next trending thing. But somehow I was the one wasting money. London loved reminding me how I'd never get asked to prom. You'll probably die a virgin, she'd laugh. Some of us are just meant to be beautiful, High school ended, London went straight to working at the mall because she wanted to get to discovered as a model. Translation she thought her looks would carry her through life. She spent every paycheck on tanning packages and highlights, living for the weekend parties.

Closet smelled like Mom's perfume and Dad's Cologne. Everything in our house had an owner. Mom's T V, Dad's coffee maker, Mom's milk, Dad's bread. They labeled everything with a label maker. The leftovers, the salt, even the ice cubes. I found labels on things you wouldn't believe. Mom's toilet paper, Dad's light bulbs.

I stopped wanting birthdays by age 10. Then they started communicating through me. Tell your mother I paid the water Bill. Tell your father he's three days late.

I have three notebooks full of their messages to each other through me. When I was 13, mom started dating. She'd bring men home while dad was in the house.

I remember thinking how lucky I was, especially when he take me to his hospital and let me shadow him while he worked with kids. But everything changed when my little brother Tommy was born. Richard became obsessed with making Tommy a medical prodigy. He'd force him to study anatomy flashcards instead of playing with toys. By age 4, Tommy could name every bone in the human body. But he'd never been to a playground. I started noticing bruises on Tommy's arms. When I asked, Richard said they were for surgery. He'd make Tommy practice sutures on oranges for hours, squeezing his wrist until it bruised if his stitches weren't perfect. My mom worked night shifts as a nurse, so she rarely saw what happened. When I told her, Richard convinced her I was jealous of Tommy's special education. He even showed her videos of Tommy perfectly reciting medical terms, saying, see? He loves learning. One night, I heard Tommy crying in the study. I found Richard forcing him to memorize surgical procedures, clapping his face each time he made a mistake. Tommy was shaking, holding an ice pack to his cheek. That's when I started recording everything on my phone.

I'm 18, and my mom left me alone on my birthday to take her new husband and his kids to Disney World. You're too old for family trips anyway, she said, while packing matching Mickey Mouse shirts for everyone but me. See, my mom remarried when I was 15 to this guy Dave, who came with two bratty kids. From day one, they treated me like an intruder in my own home. The kids got the master bedroom upstairs, while I was banished to the basement. Family game nights. I wasn't invited. Christmas morning, they opened presents while I watched from the kitchen. Mom completely transformed into this new person, desperate to prove she was the perfect stepmom. Every weekend was about Dave's kids. Soccer games, birthday parties, shopping trips. Meanwhile, I worked part time at a grocery store just to buy my own food, because somehow the family grocery budget never included me. But here's the thing. My grandmother left me this house when she passed two years ago. The will was crystal clear. The house goes directly to me. At 18, mom was just supposed to be the temporary caretaker until then. Except she conveniently forgot to mention this little detail to Dave when they got married. I discovered this when I started digging through Grandma's old papers in the attic and found the will. I contacted the lawyer who handled Grandma's estate. Your mother was supposed to inform you about this inheritance when you turned 16, he explained. She's been legally obligated to maintain the property for you, not make major changes without permission.

Look, when I was 12, I wasn't exactly known for making good life decisions. My crowning achievement up until that point was hiding in the bathroom for an entire gym class and convincing everyone I'd been locked in by accident. So when I forgot to do my history homework, my brain naturally went, time for a bold lie. I went with the classic my dog ate my homework. Now, normally, this should have been a quick exchange. Teacher rolls eyes, I get a zero, life moves on. But my teacher, Mrs. Reynolds, was built different. She didn't even blink. She just folded her arms and said, bring me proof. Proof? I froze like I just been caught trying to smuggle a raccoon into an airport. I, I stammered out an okay and sat back down, my heart pounding. Since when do teachers fact check homework excuses all day? I was panicking at lunch. I told my best friend Derek. He immediately said, easy, just have your dog chew it up tonight. Which, yes, is logical. But my actual homework was steam and untouched in my bag. If I use that, she'd know I was lying. So naturally, I went full CIA black Ops mode. Step one, I printed a fresh copy of the homework so there was no trace of my handwriting. Step 2, I covered it in peanut butter. Not a little. I'm talking a thick smear that could Glue a toddler to a wall. Step three. I called in the star of the operation, my dog, Kevin. Now, Kevin is not a small dog. He's a 90 pound golden retriever who thinks paper is just seasoning for whatever food is on it. At first, he sniffed the page suspiciously. Then, chaos. He shredded it, drooled on it, and somehow managed to embed one of his own hairs into the pulp.

Last night I realized it's a real murder that happens tomorrow. And he's the killer. For three years, every single night, my eight year old son, Ethan has insisted on the exact same bedtime story. Not from a book. He wants me to tell it from memory. If I change even one word, he screams until I start over. Tell me about the red door house, he always says. So I tell him. Once there was a yellow house with a red door at 47 Maple street. Inside lived Mrs. Carpenter, who made cookies every Sunday. She had three cats, muffin, buttons and snowball. One night, a little boy knocked on her red door exactly seven times. The story continues the same way. Every time. The boy asks for water, Mrs. Carpenter lets him in. He goes to her kitchen, takes a knife from the third drawer, and does something I always describe vaguely as a bad thing that made Mrs. Carpenter go to sleep forever. Then he leaves through the back door, counts to 100, and goes home. I thought I made it up. Some half asleep nonsense I created three years ago when Ethan wouldn't stop crying. But he latched onto it, demanding it word for word every night. Last night, after I finished the story, Ethan asked something new. Daddy, is 47 Maple street far from here? There is no 47 Maple street. But it's Just a story. Yes, there is. I looked it up on your phone. It's only six blocks away. My blood went cold. I grabbed my phone and searched. He was right. 47 Maple street existed six blocks from our house. A yellow house with a red door, according to the real estate listing owner, Dorothy Carpenter. I stayed up all night researching. Dorothy Carpenter was 73, lived alone, had three cats. According to her Facebook, the cat. Cats names made me drop my phone. Muffin buttons and snowball. This morning, I drove past her house. Yellow with a red door, exactly as I've been describing for three years. But I've never seen it before. We moved here only three years ago, and I never go that route. I called in sick to work and spent the day trying to rationalize this. Maybe I'd seen it subconsciously. Maybe Ethan had heard about it somewhere. But then I found something that destroyed any rational explanation. In my closet, buried in a box of old papers, I found a journal. I didn't remember keeping my handwriting, but I had no memory of writing it. The first entry was dated four years ago, before we

When I woke up, the plane was empty. Flying terrified me. I'd avoided it for 23 years until my sister's wedding in California forced my hand. The airport statistics didn't help. 86 commercial accidents last year, according to the departure board display. My hands shook. Boarding pass to the flight attendant. She had perfect white teeth and that practiced airline smile. Welcome aboard, sir. Seat 14A. Right down the aisle. I found my window seat and tried to calm down. Deep breaths. The cabin filled with passengers, families, business travellers. A crying baby in row six. Normal people doing normal things. Flying was routine for them. During take off, my chest felt like it would cave in from the pressure. When the plane hit turbulence and dropped suddenly, I yelled. A kid behind me giggled before his mom shushed him. My face burned with embarrassment. But after an hour, I started to relax. The flight attendant, her name tag said Rebecca, brought me water and asked if I was okay. First time flying, she said kindly. You're doing great. I watched movies on the screen, played simple games on the remote. The fear faded into boredom. Maybe flying wasn't so terrible after all. Around hour three, they dimmed the cabin lights to blue. Most passengers tried to sleep in the cramped seats. I decided to do the same. Anything to make time pass faster. That's when I heard the whispers. Soft Voices speaking just below the hum of the engines. My drowsy mind couldn't make out the words, but something felt wrong about the rhythm. The cadence was too regular, like chanting. I fell asleep anyway. I woke up to silence. Complete, absolute silence. No engine noise, no air circulation, no passenger sounds. I rubbed my eyes and looked around the cabin. Every seat was empty. Not just empty. They look like nobody had ever sat in them. No blankets, no pillows, no personal items. The overhead bins were closed. Even the baby's car seat was gone. I stumbled into the aisle, my heart hammering. Hello? I called out. Rebecca? Anyone? My voice echoed strangely in the empty space. I checked the bathrooms, the galley, every row of seats. Nothing. I pressed my face to a window and saw we were still flying. Dark sky, stars, the faint outline of clouds far below. I was alone on a plane at 30,000 feet. I ran toward the cockpit, but the cabin just kept going. Row after row of empty seats, all identical. The blue

Now I know why we moved so much when I was a kid. I don't usually celebrate birthdays anymore, but this year my dad surprised me with a package that showed up at my apartment door. Inside was a USB drive with a note in his messy handwriting. Emma's Home Movies, 1995 to 2000. Happy Birthday, sweetheart. I was excited because I barely remembered anything from when I was little. We moved around constantly when I I was a kid, and dad always said it was because of his job in construction, but we never stayed anywhere longer than two years. Most of our old photos got lost during one of the moves. I plugged the drive into my laptop and found dozens of video files organized by year. The quality was terrible, typical 90s camcorder footage. But seeing my younger self was amazing. I watched myself learning to walk, playing in various backyards, blowing out birthday candles in different houses. But something felt off in every video. We seem to be living in really nice houses with expensive furniture and big yards, way nicer than anything a construction worker could afford. I texted my dad asking about it, but he didn't respond. Then I got to the videos from 1997, when I would have been about 4 years old. The first clip showed me playing in a beautiful kitchen with marble countertops, while the woman's voice off camera encouraged Me. But it wasn't my mother's voice. Mom had died when I was two, and dad raised me alone after that. Who's that good girl? The woman said. Emma. Such a good helper. I paused the video. The woman sounded middle aged, kind. Nothing like the babysitter's dad occasionally hired. Watching and saw glimpses of her shadow moving around, but the camera never showed her face. The next video was dated three weeks later. Same kitchen, but now I was sitting at the table, crying, while Dad's voice tried to comfort me from behind the camera. It's okay, sweetheart. The nice lady had to go away. We're going to live somewhere new now. A chill ran down my spine. The timeline was adding up to something horrible. I jumped to 1998. New house, different kitchen, but the same pattern. Another woman's voice talking to me, teaching me to tie my shoes. Emma, you're getting so big. Soon you'll be starting kindergarten. Then three weeks later, the same scenario. Me crying, dad comforting me. Talk about moving again.

But the contract was weird. No photos allowed, no discussing work details, mandatory on site housing. It's just NDAs and corporate stuff, he told me over the phone after his first week. Monsters here are insane, though, Blake. Like, movie quality realistic. I can't believe they're just costume. He called me every Sunday for two months. Always excited, always raving about how authentic everything looked. Then the calls got shorter. Stranger. Blake, you know how some actors are just naturally gifted? He asked during what would be our last conversation. Like they become the character completely. Some of these guys never break character. Ever. That was three weeks ago. Yesterday. I got a text from his number at 3:00am. They're not costumes. Don't come looking for me. Tell mom I'm sorry. I drove to Darkwood Park immediately. The receptionist, a pale woman with hollow eyes, said Ethan had quit without notice, no forwarding address. When I asked to speak with management, she just stared at me until I left. But I didn't leave. I parked outside the employee housing complex behind the park and waited. At sunset, workers started trickling out. Some looked normal, tired. Carrying backpack, chatting on phones. Others moved differently, mechanical, like they were concentrating on walking upright. One of the normal workers, a girl, maybe 19, approached my car. You're looking for someone, aren't you? She whispered, glancing nervously at the other employees. Her name was Whitney. She worked there four months. Your brother trained me, she said. He was assigned to the werewolf in Midnight Forest. Big guy, seven feet tall, silver fur, beautiful craftsmanship. Except. Except what? It breathes.

Last week, I found out the horrifying reason why. My dad has been feeding people in our basement for as long as I can remember. Every night at exactly 8:47, he would grab the leftover dinner, walk downstairs for 20 minutes, then come back up with an empty plate. I used to think this was completely normal until I realized how messed up it actually was. When I was 6, I asked my mom about the voices coming from downstairs. She just lit another cigarette and said, your father handles the basement handle upstairs. Her hands were shaking the whole time she said it. I could tell she was scared, but I didn't know why. The basement door was always locked with this huge deadbolt. I tried opening it once when I was eight, and my dad caught me. His face went completely white. He told me to never go down there because they weren't ready to meet me yet. But I could hear them. A little girl singing, A baby crying at three in the morning. Christmas was the weirdest time because my dad would bring two sets of presents. One pile for me and another armload that disappeared downstairs. I'd hear kids screaming with excitement while I opened my gifts alone upstairs. Mom would just chain smoke by the window, staring at nothing. When I turned 12, everything changed. The singing stopped. No more laughter, no more voices. Just Complete silence. But dad still brought food down every single night. He'd come back up faster, though, looking sick. Mom started drinking wine for breakfast. Convinced my best friend Trevor to sleep over that weekend. Maybe if someone else was there, dad would finally explain what was going on. But at 8:47, he grabbed the plate like always. Trevor followed me to the basement door. That's when we heard her. A woman's voice, desperate and hollow. Please let us out. Austin's getting older. He'll understand now. We've been good. We've been so good. Trevor's face went completely white. Dude, that's messed up. We should call someone. But dad was already coming back up. He saw us by the door and dropped the plate. It shattered everywhere. Boys, go to Austin's room now! That night, I heard my parents fighting for hours. Mom was sobbing, saying they couldn't keep doing this. Dad kept repeating, they need to stay down there. You know what happens if they don't. The next morning, Trevor's parents

Didn't wanna win, but sleeping down here made me sick last time. It's not your fault, I said, but the words felt hollow. Marvin had already stopped talking to both of us.

I watched Marvin set his alarm for 4:00am. Just to beat us to the by week two, Bianca started hiding my homework. I found it crumpled in the trash after getting a zero.

He hasn't aged a single day. When I started teaching third grade at Rosewood Elementary, I thought I'd seen everything. But nothing prepared me for Ryan. He showed up on the second day of school clutching a class assignment sheet that said, Room 12, Mess Carter. Ryan Blackwood. I didn't remember his name on my roster, but kids get enrolled late all the time. Ryan was 8 years old. Blond hair, green eyes, small scar above his left eyebrow. Quiet kid who always sat in the back corner. Wore the same red hoodie every day. At the end of third grade, Ryan's parents apparently decided he needed to repeat the year. Academic struggles, they said. Weird, because Ryan was one of my brightest students. Fourth year of teaching, same thing. Ryan showed up again, clutching that assignment sheet. Same red hoodie, same corner seat. Still 8 years old. Fifth year, same Ryan. Same assignment sheet, same eight year old face. Sixth year, I started taking photos. Ryan in September looked identical to Ryan from five years ago. Same height, same baby teeth, same everything. Seventh year, I confronted the principal, showed her the photos. That's not the same child, she said. This year's student is Robert Blackwood, Ryan's younger brother. I looked at the photos again. Name on this year's assignment sheet had changed to Robert Blackwood in my hands. Eighth year, was Richard Blackwood. Same face, same scar. Same red hoodie that never faded. Ninth year brought Russell Blackwood. I started documenting everything. Every year, a new Blackwood boy who looked precisely like Ryan from five years ago. But in year 10, something changed. This year's assignment sheet read Ronald Blackwood. But when I looked at his face, his green eyes had no pupils, just solid green, like marbles. His skin had a waxy, artificial texture. During recess, he sat perfectly still for 30 minutes. Didn't move, didn't blink. Other kids played around him like he wasn't there. Ronald, are you okay? I asked. He turned his head toward me with a mechanical click. I'm fine, Miss Carter. His voice sounded hollow, like it was coming from inside a tunnel.

Some bridges need burning. My sister demanded I sleep with her husband to give them a baby because she was infertile. Rachel had always been the golden child, who once faked a cancer scare to steal attention at my wedding and later sued her bridesmaid for getting pregnant before her big day. She got dad's business connections and mom's jewellery collection while I scraped by with community college loans, then married rich and spent her days posting filtered photos or telling my seven year old daughter she was too fat for dance class. When I miscarried last year, she posted about it on Facebook before I could tell anyone, adding prayer hands, emojis and everything happens for reason while collecting sympathy likes. But now, after five years of her trying to conceive a baby, family suddenly meant everything to her. Her obsession with natural conception had cost them hundreds of thousands of dollars on fertility crystals and moon ceremonies. She refused IVF, calling it artificial poison, and wouldn't consider adoption because she needed to know her child's genetics. During Sunday dinner, she stared at my kids with tears streaming down her face, gripping her husband's hand until her knuckles turned white. That's when mom leaned over and whispered, you know, you have such beautiful children, and you and Rachel share the same DNA. And then two weeks later, the spa day invitation. That should have been my first warning, but I thought maybe she wanted To reconnect. Instead, I walked into her living room to find mom already there, both of them wearing matching silk robes and expectant. We have the perfect solution, Rachel announced, gesturing for me to sit between them. You're going to sleep with Dave and give us a baby naturally, the way nature intended. She said it like she was asking to borrow a cup of sugar, while mom nodded along like this was discussing vacation plan. I couldn't believe I was actually considering it. And Rachel didn't spare a second in sending me ovulation tracking apps and insisting I take fertility tests at her private clinic. She wore me down with daily phone calls and surprise visits, always with mom as backup. But then I found myself sitting in her marble bathroom letting her inject me with hormones. She had me taking supplements that made my skin crawl and my emotions swing wildly. My husband slammed doors and accused me of being insane for even considering it. I moved to his parents house. Well, I just kept hoping she come to her senses. Everything changed the day I was holding laundry and heard her on the phone with her best friend laughing about something. Dave asked for an open marriage last year, she said. My hands froze on a tiny pink shirt. This kills two birds. He gets his variety.

Three years ago, my coworker and I got married in Vegas for a work visa. The plan was brilliant. I needed to stay in the country. He needed my health insurance for his daughter's surgery. Quick courthouse wedding, two years of fooling immigration, then a quiet divorce. We high fived after signing the papers like we just pulled off a heist. We had. The first year was pure performance art. We memorized each other's birthdays, allergies, childhood pets. I Learned he takes his coffee with three sugars. He Learned I sleep on the left side. Immigration interviewed us twice. We passed by knowing things real couples probably didn't. We'd studied each other like a test. His daughter Emma called me daddy's friend even though I was at every soccer game. We had rules. No dating others for two years. Too risky. Separate bedrooms when no one was watching. Joint bank account for show. Separate finances for real. We wore our rings to work and family events. Took them off at home. Mine lived on my keychain, his in his gym bag. Year two, the lines blurred. I started making his coffee without thinking he'd already be on the left side of the couch, leaving my spot open. Emma started calling me by my name instead of daddy's friend. When she got sick. I drove them to the E R. At 3 a m. Without him asking. Stayed for seven hours. That Wasn't for immigration. We joke about our divorce party we throw in. Six months, made a Pinterest Board of freedom cakes. His mom kept asking when we'd give her grandchildren. We'd laugh and say, after the divorce, when she couldn't hear. She never knew it was fake. Still doesn't. Eight months ago, I was offered a job in London. Dream position, triple salary. I said yes immediately. The marriage was almost over anyway. That night he cooked dinner. Real dinner, not our usual takeout. So you're leaving? He said, not looking up from the cutting board.

Daddy? My teenage daughter started getting mysterious phone calls every afternoon. And I thought it was just normal teenager stuff. But then I noticed the pattern. Every day at 3:30 p m, her phone would ring with an unknown number. She'd immediately stop whatever she was doing and answer. On the first ring, her whole demeanor would change instantly. Voice dropping to a whisper, shoulders hunching forward, quickly walking to her room. When I. I asked who was calling, she'd just say, nobody important and close her door. Her behaviour started changing in other ways, too. She stopped hanging out after school. No more drama club meetings. No more study groups at the library. She'd rush home every single day, anxiously checking her phone every few minutes until that call came through. My husband thought I was being paranoid. She's 15. Girls have secrets. This is completely normal behaviour. But my mom instincts were screaming that something was seriously wrong. I started paying closer attention to these calls. She'd be on them for hours. Sometimes I could hear her through the door, speaking so quietly I couldn't make out words. But the tone was strange. Gentle, patient. Almost like she was comforting someone. No giggling like when she talked to friends. No complaining like when she talked to us. Just this soft, careful voice I'd never heard her use before. One afternoon, I was folding laundry outside her room when I heard her say something that made me freeze. I love you too, dad. See you tomorrow. Same time. My blood ran cold instantly. Her father was literally downstairs watching TV. Who was she calling? Dad? I knocked on her door immediately. She opened it, phone already hidden behind her back. Her face was red, eyes puffy, like she been crying. Everything okay, sweetie? I asked, trying to keep my voice casual. Fine, mom. Just talking to a friend about homework. But I saw her call log notification still glowing on her smartwatch. 2 hours and 43 minutes. What? Homework discussion lasted almost

I picked up my daughter Zoe from school Tuesday afternoon, and when I leaned over to kiss her forehead like I always did, she jerked away. Don't, dad. Miss Novak taught us that when you get kissed, the person's DNA stays inside you for seven years, like you're infected. She said, we're collecting other people's gross stuff and can't ever get it out. Her eyes welled up. Mom kissed me goodbye this morning. Does that mean I have her gross DNA stuck in me now? My hands tightened on the steering wheel. I teach AP biology at the high school across town. And not only was this scientifically false, it was psychologically damaging. That evening, I sent Miss Novak a polite email explaining that I was Zoe's father and a biology teacher, and that DNA from saliva breaks down within hours, not years. Her reply came quickly. Mr. Coleman, it was a simple lesson on DNA and germs. You know, how kids can traumatize things. Wouldn't worry about it. I tried to brush it off, figuring maybe she just misspoken or Zoe had misunderstood. But then Wednesday morning, Zoe refused breakfast, and when I asked why, she pushed her bowl away and said, yesterday Miss Novak was crying in class. She kept talking about this guy she used to date, like, three years ago. She said she can still feel his gross DNA inside her from when They kissed him and she called him a walking contamination or something. I nearly choked on my coffee. She's discussing her ex boyfriend with 12 year olds. Zoe nodded miserably. She was actually crying, dad. She said guys like Brad just want to infect girls with their DNA and then leave them. It was really weird. By Thursday, the parent group chat explode. Multiple children had come home terrified of physical contact. One mother wrote that her daughter wouldn't hug her uncle anymore because Miss Novak said men spread more DNA than women. Another parent said their son was dehydrated because he refused to use the water fountain after Miss Novak said drinking from it was basically like kissing everyone who used it before you, collecting years of their DNA in your mouth. First thing Friday morning, I met with Prince Vazquez alongside three other concerned parents. We presented our concerns about Miss Novak, discussing her personal dating life and teaching false science. The principal reviewed her file and found two previous complaints.

The case worker, Miss Lane, showed up with her clipboard already out and her pen clicking. And two days later, my mother in law filed for emergency custody. I tried explaining I work from home, but Lane just kept her eyes on her notepad, scribbling away. And my chest got tight watching her write down whatever story she'd already decided was true. My lawyer, Tom, was the only one who believed my side of things. When I brought him the custody papers, I watched his eyebrows shoot up as he spread them across his mahogany desk, pointing to different sections where my mother in law had brought up the life insurance trust fund three times in documents that were supposed to be about Megan safety. Why would she keep mentioning money and papers about keeping Megan safe? Tom tapped the papers with his Pen and said we needed to look deeper into her motivations. That's when pieces started falling into place. Bought a leather journal and started tracking everything. After Miss UNT. Lane's second surprise visit, the pattern was obvious. Once I started writing it down. Lane would show up unannounced with her clipboard, and somehow my mother in law's silver car would appear within minutes. Every single time, she'd step out with her hand pressed over her heart. Playing the worried grandmother perfectly. Tom's investigator changed everything when he slid that Manila folder across the desk. My mother in law owed $200,000 in tax liens. The dates made my stomach drop. Filed just two months before

I'm 19, working at target during the day and delivering pizzas at night just to afford community college. Dad moved in with his girlfriend Nicole three months ago after losing his apartment when he got fired. The arrangement was supposed to be temporary, just until I get back on my feet, he promised. That was 12 weeks ago, and he spent most of his time on my couch watching Netflix. Yesterday, Nicole storms into my room while I'm trying to study for my accounting midterm. She's got that entitled look she gets when she's about to make unreasonable demands. We need to talk about your living situation. I looked up from my textbook my living situation. With the baby coming in six months, we're going to need your room for the nursery. You're young and flexible. You can sleep anywhere. I stared at her. This woman who contributes exactly zero dollars to household expenses was trying to kick me out of my own bedroom. This is my room, Nicole. She crossed her arms. Not anymore. Your father and I discussed it, and we've decided you can use the garage. We'll get you a space heater for winter. I actually laughed out loud. The garage? Are you completely insane? Don't be dramatic, Lucas. Lots of college kids would love a free place to stay. You should be grateful. Free place? To stay? That's rich, coming from someone who hasn't paid a dime toward anything. That's when inspiration hit me. I pulled out my phone and scrolled to my landlord's number. What are you doing? Nicole asked nervously. I hit dial and put it on speaker. Hi, Mrs. Davis, it's Lucas. Quick question. Whose name is on the lease for this house? Nicole's eyes went wide as she realized what was happening. Just yours, Lucas, like we discussed when you signed it six months ago. Why? Is there a problem? No problem. And who pays the rent every month

She's been dropping engagement hints constantly, showing me rings, talking about weddings I've been secretly saving for months. Even picked out a ring.

This scrawny kid named Georgie slipped a hundred dollar Bill into my hand during lunch and told me it was mine if I beat up Carson Block. I almost spit out my chocolate milk. Carson was the biggest eighth grader anyone had ever seen. He looked like he spent time in prison and was pitching, not catching G, if you know what I mean. The kid was six feet tall with arms thicker than my legs. Meanwhile, Georgie was maybe 90 pounds, soaking wet, with these skinny arms that look like twigs. His left arm was in a homemade sling made from an old T-shirt. I stared at the money, thinking this had to be some kind of joke. Nobody in their right mind would pay someone to fight Carson. The kid had put three seventh graders in the nurse's office just this month. I'm pretty sure the security guards were scared of him. But Georgie's eyes were dead serious and kind of desperate. Why me? I asked. Because you're the only one who stands a chance. You knocked out that ninth grader last year who was messing with your sister. That was different, though. That kid had been picking on my little sister for weeks. This felt random and weird. Plus, a hundred bucks was more money than I'd ever seen a middle schooler carry around. Georgie must have noticed my confusion because he leaned in closer. Please, I've been saving up for months. Nobody else will do it. Something about the way he said it made me pause. This wasn't about showing off or some stupid dare. Georgie looks scared but determined. I pocketed the money and told him to meet me after school to explain what was really going on. We sat on the bleachers by the empty football field. Georgie kept glancing around like he was worried someone would see us talking. Up close, I could see bruises on his neck that looked a few days old. His homemade sling was because he couldn't afford a real doctor. Carson and his dad moved in with us two months ago.

His brother, the guy I chose over Gavin 12 years back. F it, why not? It was there that I saw him the first time in years. Gavin, now taller, breathtaking and cold. I smiled and waved at him, but he looks right through me during the rehearsal dinner, like I was wallpaper. Just walk. Don't look at me, don't talk to me, Gavin said during the practice run. Should we at least try to pretend we're okay? He replied sharply. I've been pretending you don't exist for 12 years. One more day won't kill me. He sat far from me at dinner, left when I entered rooms, hopped over me when I tripped, and fell flat on my face. Even when Rex joked about baby brother, old crush, Gavin just yawned as if he was bored. Even thinking about me, it hurt, but all I could think was how he used to wait for me after school, carrying me on his back. When I got hurt at the wedding, my first goal was to get Near him, I switched our place cards, only to watch him switch seats.

When a bridesmaid started crying, I sat on the floor with her, fixed her makeup, and made her laugh through the tears. I glanced up and Gavin was in the doorway, watching with a soft smile. I looked away, embarrassed, but when I looked back, he was gone. A lost opportunity that made me want to bang my head on the table. By eleven PM, I knew I blew it. I drank down a glass of champagne and sat in the back of the room, feeling sad and best friendless. I watched the groom, Rex, stand up to give his drunk and sloppy speech. Thank you all for coming here. And thanks also to my ex. He pointed at me. I sat up straight.

My 16 year old daughter Peyton used to be my perfect kid who played volleyball and got straight A's. Then I discovered her secret Instagram pregnancy shaming account, and everything I believed about her shattered. My hands were shaking as I scrolled through months of posts. Peyton was screenshotting girls from school after lunch or pool photos and circling their stomachs with red arrows claiming pregnancy. I felt sick reading the brutal comments calling these girls horrible names. One girl switched schools, another was on anxiety medication. My perfect daughter had 10,000 followers and was making money from ads while destroying girl girls lives over normal body changes. I couldn't believe this was my child. Three days later, Janet grabbed my arm at work with trembling hands. Her daughter had tried to end herself, leaving a note about the pregnancy shaming page. That night at dinner, Peyton's laugh made me flinch. She shoved her phone at me. Look at this girl claiming she just had a big lunch. It's so obviously a baby bump. My stomach dropped. It was Janet's daughter. I watched my child giggle at a girl who nearly died and felt something break inside me. For a whole week, I stayed up late studying how Peyton destroyed these girls. I made my own anonymous account and followed the same gossip pages she did.

My daughter was invited to a classmate's birthday party at a bowling alley. The event was an all girls party, and from what I could tell, there were about 17 girls in attendance. He arrived about five minutes late and walked in at the same time as another classmate, Betty. Due to a bit of a line, it took about 10 minutes for both girls to get their bowling shoes and head toward the reserved lanes. The hostess had booked three adjacent lanes. Like most bowling setups, each pair of lanes had a shared seating area with curved benches. When we got there, I noticed that lanes one and two already had several girls names programmed. On lane three, an adult male, someone I didn't recognize, was programming names into the system. When Annie approached the group, she was told to go to lane three. I greeted a few parents and noticed Annie walk away. I asked where she was going, and she said she'd been told to go find a blue bowling ball because it was lighter. I checked and realized the ball she was heading toward was actually 14 pounds. I went to find a lighter one and brought it back to her. A parent nearby asked if I was bowling. I said, no, just helping Annie get the right ball. At that moment, the dad of another girl, Called out to Betty that her name had been added to lane 2, and the birthday girl's mom, Dana, the hostess, came over. I asked her if Annie could be added to either lane one or two, assuming that all the girls would be mixed across the three lanes. Dana told me Annie was on lane three. I was surprised, so I walked over to look. Sure enough, Annie's name was on lane three. The only people bowling there were Annie and the adult male along with

So when I finally saw her, 15 missed calls, she was furious. I need to know you're actually where you say you are, she said. But I already sent you my location and a picture of us on the coach. It's not enough. What if there are girls hiding behind you on the couch? Or what if it's just an old picture? I'm not stupid. From now on, when you're out, we video call so I can see. Or you can wake up single the next day. She hung up, practically foaming at the mouth. The first few calls were painfully awkward. I'd have to go around the house, introduce each of my friends to her, basically give her a house tour to show it's all clear before she hang up. And randomly call again in the next hour or so to make sure I didn't change locations or invited over girls to my friend's house. After a few days like this, everyone was going crazy over her rule. My friend Jeff pulled me to the side with a concerned look. Dude, honestly, if she's gonna act crazy, you gotta do it, too. That's when it came to me. A brilliant idea. The next time I was at Jeff's house, I answered Cindy's call in my best David Attenborough voice. Here we observe the male human in his natural habitat. Approaching the buffalo wings with caution, I slowly turned the camera towards my friends, who immediately caught on and started acting like wildlife. In the background, dinner was pretending to be a gazelle and Jeff was chest beating like a gorilla. Very funny, Cindy said, rolling her eyes at us. The next Friday, we took it further. I answered the call holding a microphone, reading out a fake weather forecast, while Jeff held up a map glued to a pizza box. Currently, we're experiencing a high pressure system of Mario Kart moving through the living room area, I announced. Temperatures are rising as we travel through Rainbow Road. Now back to you, Cindy.

Ellen was this quiet, serious kid who'd seen way too much for his age. He'd flinch whenever we raised our voices, even if we were just calling him for dinner from the other room. It took months before he'd laugh at my terrible dad jokes or let us hug him without going stiff. But slowly, he started opening up. He'd help Mike in the garage on weekends, asked me to pack extra snacks for school, started calling us mom and dad around his 10th birthday. For years, everything was perfect. Helen made good grades, played baseball in middle school, had friends over for sleepovers. We never hid his adoption from him, but he seemed completely settled with us. When he turned 16, I taught him to drive in our old Honda Civic. Mike took him fishing every summer. We were a real family. But then his senior year, something changed.

Some dogs are indoor dogs, she'd say when I asked why biscuit couldn't come to the park. He's shy. The rules about biscuit were non negotiable. Only mom feeds him. Never go downstairs after 9 p m. Don't tell friends about our special dog. If he makes noise during dinner parties, turn the TV louder. I was 12 when I started questioning things. What kind of dog barks in perfect English words sometimes? Why did his howls sound like help, please? Must be my imagination. Dad said dogs make weird sounds. My little sister Amy loved biscuit. Would sneak him cookies through the basement door slot. One day, she dropped her doll down there. There. And cried until mom let her retrieve it. She came back confused. Biscuit has hands, she whispered to me. He gave me my doll with hands, mom heard. Amy spent the weekend at Grandma's for lying. When she came back, she never mentioned Biscuit's hands again. I started paying attention. Biscuits food bowls were always plastic plates and cups, never dog bowls. His kibble looked suspiciously like cereal. His water bowl had a straw in it. Sometimes the basement door had seven locks, seven from the outside. One night, I heard biscuit howling. Again. But this time, I pressed my ear to the floor. It wasn't howling. It was crying. Sobbing. Human sobbing. I snuck Dad's keys while he slept. Crept to the basement door at three a

I was at one of those chaotic indoor play places for my son Leo's seventh birthday party. He'd spent the entire hour at the ticket spewing Jackpot game, his face a mask of pure concentration. Finally, he hit the grand prize. A river of 1,000 tickets poured out of the machine. He was ecstatic, clutching the massive paper snake to his chest like a holy relic. That's when I saw him. A little boy, maybe five years old, pointed at Leo's tickets. I want that one. His father, a guy in an expensive tracksuit who'd been on his phone the whole time, came over. He didn't look at me, only at the tickets. Hey, my son wants those, let him have them. I was genuinely stunned. I'm sorry, what? My son just won these. The dad let out a long breath like I was a massive inconvenience. Look, he's having a meltdown. Just give him the tickets. The kids birthday party. They need to learn to share, right? I stared at him. No, he saved his tokens. All party to win this. He's not giving it away. He raised his voice loud enough for the other parents at our party table to hear. Are you serious? You're going to let your kid be selfish over a bunch of worthless paper? What kind of values are you teaching him? I could feel the blood in my cheeks. Kind Of values where you don't hand over your things just because someone throws a tantrum. Now he was practically yelling, my son is having a bad day. You're raising a spoiled brat who doesn't care about other people's feelings. His son was still screaming. And now other families were starting to stare at the scene he was creating. Leo had been watching the whole thing. He looked from the screaming boy to the angry father, then down at his precious roll of tickets. The father saw his chance and knelt down, his voice sickly sweet. Hey, little man.

On championship night, I was 5 feet 6 inches and 145 pounds as a high school freshman. The size of a decent seventh grader. My dad's jeans had cursed me with a body better suited for cross country than contact sports. But I didn't wanna run in circles. I wanted to play football. Coach Morris looked at me like I was roadkill when I showed up for tryouts. 30 seconds into my first drills, I heard it. Wilson, what are you doing here? The chess club meets in the library. The team erupted in laughter. Kept my mouth shut. Finish the drill. You're gonna get yourself killed out here, kid. Coach said afterward, why don't you try something else? Maybe track? I looked him straight in the eye. I wanna play. He sighed. Fine. You can be equipment manager, help with practice. Maybe in a few years, if you grow. So that's what I did. I washed jerseys, fixed helmets, set up cones and filled water bottles while the actual players got to play. After everyone left, I'd run the same drills they did. I set up tackling dummies and hit them until my shoulders ache. I studied playbooks like they were sacred tech. Junior year, I grown two inches and added 20 pounds of muscle. Still small, but solid. I tried out again. This time I didn't just run drills. I demolished them. My 40 yard dash was second fastest on the team. My route running was precise. My hands never dropped a pass. Not bad, coach admitted. But this isn't a practice drill. This is varsity football. Those guys across town would snap you like a twig. He put me on special teams. The Suicide Squad. Just bodies to throw at kick returns. First game of the season, I flew down the field on kickoff, weaving through blockers twice my size, and made a tackle that echoed through the stadium. The crowd erupted. Coach ignored it, called it lucky. Then I did it again the next game. And the next. By mid season, I forced two fumbles on kick returns. Fans started chanting will, son! Will, son! Whenever kickoff came. Except for Brandon Reeves, our star quarterback and the coach's godson. 6 foot 3, college scouts at every game. Arrogance as big as his arm. He made it his mission to.

I bought my first house last year after saving for six years. It's not fancy, but it's mine. My sister Emma is 25, dropped out of college twice, and still lives in mom's basement. Last month she announced she's pregnant with some guy named Dave, already has three kids with two different women, and works part time at a gas station. Yesterday, mom calls saying they want to stop by and see how I've decorated the place. She's never cared about my decorating before, but now she insisted on bringing Emma along. They show up at 6 p m. With measuring tape, notebooks, and Emma's carrying a folder full of paint samples. I thought maybe Emma wanted decorating tips for her own future place. Boy, was I wrong. Emma immediately starts walking through every room like she's conducting a home inspection. She's measuring doorways and windows with her phone app, taking photos of electrical outlets, and making notes about where the crib would go. And this would be perfect for a nursery. She even opens my closets and starts talking about storage space for baby clothes. Mom sitting on my couch like she's conducting a business meeting, nodding approvingly at everything Emma says. Every few minutes, she'd call out suggestions like, don't forget to measure for the changing table and check if that window gets good morning light. After 30 minutes, Of this increasingly weird behavior. I finally asked what was going on. Mom puts down her notebook and drops the nuke. We've been doing a lot of thinking about Emma's situation lately. She needs a stable environment for the baby. And honestly, you're single with all this extra space. It just makes perfect sense when you really think about it. I'm standing there confused. When she continues without missing a beat. Emma's going to move in next month with Dave, and they'll start.

My family discovered I was good with kids when I was 14 and babysat my cousin once. That single afternoon turned me into their unpaid nanny for the next 12 years. My sister would drop off her toddler for just an hour while she ran to target. One hour became three, then six, until she'd stroll back with fresh acrylic nails, a Starbucks Frappuccino, and zero apologies. I remember sitting on my bedroom floor surrounded by broken crayons and goldfish crackers, realizing I'd missed my entire shift at the local coffee shop because of her lies. Then my brother discovered the family gold mine. Midnight texts became routine. Emergency babysitting needed. The twins, regular sitter canceled. Of course, the emergency was always tickets to concerts, bar crawls, or weekend getaways with his girlfriend. I Learned to sleep with my phone on silent. College should have been my escape, but my family had other plans. My sister would show up unannounced at my dorm, sometimes driving four hours just to dump her kids on me for entire weekends. He cost me my first serious girlfriend when she called during our anniversary dinner screaming about a fake emergency. I watched her look at me across that candlelit table and say she couldn't compete with my family's chaos anymore. After graduation, things got worse. My parents, claiming they wanted to help me settle in, secretly made copies of My apartment keys and distributed them to my siblings like VIP passes. I dragged myself home from my marketing job exhausted from client presentations, only to find my living room transformed into a daycare center, toys scattered everywhere, juice boxes leaking on my white couch, and kids I hadn't even agreed to watch. My boss pulled me aside after I missed my third important presentation.

She was shaking, holding her stomach with both hands. I need to go to the nurse, Maddie whispered, her voice barely audible. Miss A. Balance just laughed. Everyone knew she hated Maddie and was clearly trying to embarrass her. The nurse? You think the nurse is going to help you learn bladder control? Are you 7 years old? She looked disgusted, but everyone felt horrible for her already. You can go, but clean up that entire mess first. Nobody wants to have to do that. Maddie was trembling now, gripping her stomach tighter. Please, miss balance, I really need to go. But Miss Balance cut her off with a raised hand. You're not going anywhere until you clean up your mess. I don't care if you're embarrassed. Maddie stood there for another minute, breathing heavily and swaying slightly, while Miss Balance went back to her desk to grab paper towels, making a big show of how disgusted she was. I noticed Maddie's face was beat red. She was panicking, but something felt off. That's when I noticed something I hadn't paid attention to before. And that's when it hit me. Maddie had been wearing these huge, baggy sweaters for months now. Even when It was warm. Always holding her books in front of her stomach when she walked. I looked over at the other girls, and they realized it, too. Their eyes were all completely wide. Maddie didn't pee herself. Her water broke. Another girl tried to stand up for her. Miss Balance, she's really sick. She needs to go. Mister Balance rolled her eyes dramatically. She's not dying. She can clean up this filth. Then a few more tried to help. Angie said, no, seriously, just let her go to the nurse, please. But Miss Unbalance's face just got redder. Sit down! Down, all of you! Or you can help clean it up. You're wasting everyone's time with your little accident. Maddie must have realized Miss Balance wasn't going to let her leave no matter what, because she slowly, painfully lowered herself to her knees, reaching for the paper towels with shaking hands. She managed to wipe once at the puddle before a wave of pain hit her. You could see it in how

When he mentioned my girlfriend, he said, still waiting for her to find someone worthy of the family name. He stared at me while the room chuckled. After dessert, her parents ambushed us by the restrooms. Her mother had printed emails from her friend's husband. He owns several franchises. Fast food. But management track. 40,000 to start.

So I was living with this girl, Megan, who I thought was my friend. We'd known each other since freshman year, and when she said she found this perfect apartment and wanted me to sign the lease with her, I jumped at it. Five months of splitting everything fifty fifty, doing dishes like good little roommates, never fighting over anything. Then one random Tuesday, I get this text while I'm at my job at the campus bookstore. Hey, we need to talk when you get home. That's never good, right? So I'm driving back, thinking maybe she wants to talk about whose turn it is to buy toilet paper or something stupid like that. But when I walk in, she's sitting on our couch with this weird, serious face. He starts with. So I've been thinking, and I already know I'm screwed. She tells me she doesn't think living together is working out and that she already talked to our landlord about me moving out by January 1st. I'm just sitting there like, what the hell? Because we literally never fought. I paid my half of everything on time. I cleaned up after myself, and I even bought all the good stuff for our place. She's acting like I'm some nightmare roommate who's been making her life miserable. I don't argue, because, honestly, why would I want to live with someone who doesn't want me there? So I Tell her, fine, I'll start looking for a new place. She seems relieved, like she was expecting me to throw a fit or something. That night I'm lying in bed thinking about how I need to pack everything, and that's when it hits me. I look around our apartment and realise I bought literally everything that makes it nice. 50 inch TV mounted on the wall. Mine. The leather couch we're always watching Netflix on. I saved up three paychecks for that thing. The coffee maker, the good plates instead of paper ones, the router for our internet, even the freaking shower curtain. Next morning I tell Megan I'll be taking all my stuff when I move out. She just says okay, like it's no big deal. I don't think she really thought about what that meant. I spent the next two weeks apartment hunting and found this decent one bedroom across town. On moving day. I rented one of those big U Haul trucks because I knew I'd need it. Megan wasn't even home, which was probably for the best. I started with the obvious stuff, like my clothes and my desk. Then I unplugged the T V. And carefully took it down from the wall. I wrapped up the coffee maker, packed all the dishes I'd bought from target, and loaded the couch onto the truck with help from my buddy Jake. The router was the last thing I grabbed. I unpacked all the Ethernet cables and took The whole setup. As I'm walking out with it, I realised she's going to have zero internet until she gets her own. But here's the thing that really made me laugh. When I was packing up the kitchen stuff, I realised I'd bought all the cooking supplies too. The pans, the good knife set, even the can opener. I left her with basically nothing except a mini fridge and some random cups she had from high school. By the time I finished loading everything, the apartment looked like nobody had ever lived there. Just empty rooms with

Write that you want to end your life when you're at Dad's house. I stared at my phone screen, reading it three times. Mom and dad had been separated for six months. The custody battle was getting ugly. I was 14, splitting time between their apartments, and everything felt broken. Then my phone buzzed again. Call me now. Mom's voice was desperate when I answered. Did you see my text? Yeah. What the hell are you asking me to do? Your father is winning. His lawyer destroyed me in court today. I need evidence that you're not safe with him. My chest tightened. Mom, you want me to fake suicide notes? Not a suicide note. A journal entry. The therapist appointment is tomorrow. Doctor Rossi needs to see that you have these thoughts at his place. Her voice got urgent. Right. That you stare at his sleeping pills count and you think about taking them when he's asleep. Mom, stop. Listen to me. If I don't get full custody, your father loses his health insurance through my job. You know he needs insulin. It's $800 a month without coverage. She paused. He's already rationing. You've seen it. You can't use his diabetes against me. I'm using it for him. If you write this, I get custody, and I'll keep him on my insurance for the whole year. Even after the divorce. I sat on my bed feeling sick. Dad had been rationing his insulin. I'd seen him skip doses, checking his blood sugar, obsessively trying to stretch his supplies. Last week, his hands were shaking so bad he couldn't open a water. Water bottle. I can't write that I want to die. You're not actually suicidal. It's just words on paper. Write that being at his apartment makes you feel hopeless. That you think about ending it. That you wonder if anyone would care. She was crying now. Please, his help. The next morning, she showed up at Dad's apartment while he was at work. She handed me a notebook and a folded paper. Copy this in your handwriting. I opened her notes. The words made me nauseous. I think about ending it. I wonder if anyone would care. When I'm at his apartment, I imagine taking all 47 of his pills. He wouldn't find me until morning. Mom, this is insane. This is necessary.

She'd been begging me for weeks, showing me Pinterest photos of these gorgeous ocean blue highlights at target. We picked out some semi permanent dye that would wash out in a month. She was so excited she could barely sit still while I painted the streaks in our tiny bathroom. The next morning at breakfast, she kept flipping her hair and grinning at herself in the toaster reflection. I made her favorite blueberry pancakes and she kept saying how the blue and her hair match the berries perfectly. honestly the happiest I'd seen her since her dad moved out last year. But when we showed up at my sister Beth's house for Sunday dinner, everything went sideways fast. Beth took one look at Emma and her face just dropped. He pulled me into the kitchen while Emma was playing with her cousins and started going off about how irresponsible I was being. What kind of message does this send, she whispered harshly, gesturing toward the living room. She's going to look like some delinquent at school. I tried explaining it was just temporary hair dye, that Emma was still getting straight A's and playing violin, but Beth wouldn't hear it. She kept shaking her head. And muttering about how I was clear, really struggling as a single mom and needed to set better boundaries. The whole dinner was awkward after that with Beth making passive aggressive comments about certain parent choices every time Emma's hair caught the light. When we got home that night, Emma seemed deflated. She kept touching her hair and asking if I thought it looked stupid. I reassured her it looked amazing. But I could tell Beth's reaction had gotten to her. That's when I decided to call my mom to vent about the whole thing. I'm listened patiently while I ranted about Beth being judgmental.

The landlord started laughing. My roommate's boyfriend, Wesley, had been planning this moment for months, ever since he started staying over back in June. He'd been telling his boys about how he was finessing his way into a free apartment. He even started forwarding his mail here to establish what he called residency rights. The relationship wasn't even official before Wesley started making his move. He'd walk around my apartment, well, what he thought was going to be his apartment, measuring room and telling his cousin which wall would be perfect for his TV setup. Melanie's been carrying this dead weight for too long, he'd mutter while eating my groceries. Time for her to learn she doesn't need a roommate anymore. So there I was, standing in my own living room on a Thursday night. The whole place smelled like the Cologne Wesley bathed in. Wesley showed up with his cousin Mitchell and two duffel bags, already acting like he owned the place, both of them looking like they were ready to physically move me out if needed. Melanie, I hope you found somewhere else to stay, Wesley said, dropping his bags by the door. This is happening tonight. You've been taking advantage of my girl's kindness for long enough. I stayed quiet, scrolling through my phone, let him have his moment. Melanie sat on the couch, avoiding eye contact with everyone. Wesley had been working on her for weeks. Convincing her that I was holding her back, that they needed their privacy, that couples shouldn't have roommates. She'd started parroting his words recently. Maybe it's time for a change. Maybe we've outgrown this arrangement. Classic Wesley manipulation. The man didn't even have his own place. He'd been couch surfing before he latched onto Melanie. Wesley pulled out a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket. I printed out this 30 day notice. But honestly, you should just go tonight. Make this easy on everyone. Mitchell nodded like this was all perfectly legal. Smart move, Wesley. She's had a free ride.

My sister burst into my room and blocked the door, screaming, please just take Angie to prom. She's been crying about going alone. I stared at her from my desk chair and said, this has disaster written all over it. Three weeks before prom, my sister sat on my bed and launched into her pitch. Angie's been rejected by four different guys. She won't eat lunch anymore, just hides in the library. She pulled up Angie's Instagram, showing months of deleted photos. She's been my best friend since fifth grade, and now she's talking about not even going to prom. Would it kill you to ask her? The guilt was working. Angie had practically lived at our house growing up, always laughing at my dumb jokes, always bringing homemade cookies. She needs one good night before graduation. I felt my stomach not up, but agreed to try. Finding her alone in the library was easy. I walked over nervously and cleared my throat. Hey, Angie, would you maybe want to go to prom with me? She looked up, shocked, her book dropping, are you serious? When I nodded, she whispered, yes, eyes bright with disbelief. The week before prom, we went corsage shopping together at the local florist. Angie kept touching every flower nervously. I don't know anything about corsages. Is white too boring? I picked up a bright orange one and held it against her Wrist. How about traffic cone orange? She laughed and pushed my hand away. That's hideous. We spent 20 minutes making increasingly ridiculous suggestions until the florist looked ready to kick us out. Angie finally chose a simple white rose with baby his breath. So pretty, I said, looking at her. Prom night came too fast. At her house, her mom positioned us for photos by the staircase. Her dad joined her mom with his professional camera. Turn your head slightly left. No, your other left, Angie muttered. There's only one left, dad. I tried not to laugh, but failed. Start over. You're both laughing, her mom scolded. We took approximately 700 photos. Angie's face hurt from fake smiling. I looked arranged in all of these, she said, scrolling through them. Her little brother photo bombed the last few, making bunny ears behind us. At least those are honest, Angie said. In the

Don't let anyone take her. I okay. I stood there frozen while she vanished into the airport crowd without looking back. The baby was maybe 8 months old, wearing a yellow onesie with ducks on it, and he gripped my shirt with her tiny fist like we've done this before. Other passengers started staring immediately. An older couple whispered to each other while a businessman looked up from his laptop. The baby smelled like vanilla lotion and stayed weirdly calm, just watching me with huge brown eyes. Thirty seconds had passed, but it already felt like an hour. What kind of mother just hands her baby to a complete stranger? Five minutes in and the baby started that pre cry whimpering. That meant I had maybe 30 seconds before full meltdown. I tried bouncing her while making shushing sounds, but nothing worked. People were really staring now, some moving away from us like we had something contain ages. An older woman wearing a World's Best Grandma sweatshirt came over and said, honey, did she just leave you with her baby? I explained she said she'd be right back, but grandma shook her head with this knowing look. Maybe she abandoned it. People do crazy things at airports. You should find security. The baby chose that moment to go full Siren mode with that piercing cry that makes everyone in A 50, but radius wins. I walked in circles trying to calm her, but she just screamed louder. My arms were already getting sore. Where the hell was this woman? The grandmother suggested maybe I should take the baby to the information desk, but something about the mother's desperation made me stay put. At the 10 minute Mark, I noticed a man in a navy suit standing by the windows, pretending to look at planes, but watching us in the reflection.

My dad died last March after battling cancer for two years. The whole thing was brutal, watching him slowly waste away. My mom became a shell of herself during those final months. We all pulled together as a family except for my brother Chet. He had been the black sheep for years before dad got sick. Chet had stolen money from dad and dropped out of college three times. He refused to get a job or take any responsibility for his life. Dad finally cut him off financially last year after Chet stole $30,000. He took the money straight from their retirement account without asking anyone. When dad passed away, Chet showed up at the funeral home acting devastated. He even volunteered to handle the gravestone paperwork to help mom out. We were all shocked, but thought maybe losing dad had changed him. Mom was barely functioning, so we let Chet handle the Monument arrangements. We had already picked out the inscription. Together as a family. Family. It would say. Beloved father and husband forever in our hearts. The words were simple and classic. Exactly what dad would have wanted. The funeral came and went without any major incidence. Chet gave a speech about redemption and family that made everyone cry. For three weeks after the funeral, we thought he'd finally grown up. Mom even started talking about reconciling with him. She kept saying, dad would have wanted the Family to stay together. Then the day of the gravestone unveiling arrived three weeks later. Mom had been counting down to this moment since the funeral ended. She desperately needed that closure and permanent place to visit dad. My other brother, Simon, drove her to the cemetery that morning. I met them there with fresh flowers for the grave. Chet said he'd meet us there, but texted that he was running late. The cemetery worker LED us to Dad's lot in the memorial garden section. A black cloth covered the new granite stone that had just been installed. Mom was already crying while clutching

Last time she brought an entire tote bag just filled with towels because she doesn't trust hotel towels. Another tote bag with blankets because hotel comforters are gross. She even packed our coffee maker because she doesn't like the hotel coffee. The worst part isn't even the over packing, though. It's that she's always three hours late to everything. I'll tell her we need to leave at 10 in the morning to make good time. She'll roll out of bed at 11:30, take an hour to get ready, then suddenly remember she Needs to pack the car. We never actually leave until past noon. Then she wants to drive until midnight to make up for lost time. I'm stuck driving 12 hours straight while she's in the passenger seat telling me I'm going too slow or too fast. The drive becomes this miserable Marathon where we're both exhausted and cranky. This past weekend was supposed to be different though. My company sent me to a conference in Vegas. Nice resort, great location.

I just gave birth to my daughter Emma three weeks ago. The entire pregnancy was rough, but I thought the worst part was behind me until my boyfriend Jake dropped a bomb on me in the hospital recovery room while I was still hooked up to IV's and barely able to walk to the bathroom without wincing. He starts pacing around my bed like he's got something major to confess. I'm thinking he's gonna tell me his mom's coming to visit or something normal. Instead, he looks me dead in the eyes and says he wants a paternity test on our three week old daughter. The daughter I literally just pushed out of my body after 18 hours of labor. I stared at him for like 10 seconds thinking he was joking. When I realized he wasn't, I asked him why the hell he would need a paternity test. He starts rambling about how Emma doesn't look like him and how babies are supposed to look like their dads. Emma has dark hair and Jake's blonde. That's literally it. That's his entire reasoning. Never mind that my entire family has dark hair, including me. Never mind that most babies don't look like anyone specific when they're brand new. But it gets worse. He pulls out his phone and starts showing me Google searches about paternity fraud. Apparently he's been researching this for weeks. While I was pregnant. While I was Throwing up every morning and couldn't sleep because of heartburn and swollen feet. I told him he was being ridiculous and that I've never cheated on him once in our two year relationship. I don't even have guy friends he doesn't know about. My whole world has basically been work, him and preparing for this baby. He gets all defensive and says it's not about trust, it's about being sure that any responsible father would want to know for certain. That he's seen too many stories online about men raising kids that weren't theirs. The nurse walked in right as I started crying, and Jake immediately shuts up and pretends to be the supportive boyfriend. As soon as she leaves, he starts up again about how this is normal and lots of couples.

My husband's parents showed up at our place last year asking if they could crash for a couple weeks. Their landlord was being a complete ass and wasn't fixing their heating, so they needed somewhere warm to stay while they figured things out. I felt bad for them, honestly. It was December and freezing cold outside. Two weeks turned into six months real quick. They set up camp in our living room with their air mattress and started treating our house like their personal hotel. His mom would sleep until noon every day. While I was getting ready for work, she'd shuffle to the kitchen in her pajamas and complain that we didn't have the right coffee creamer or that our Wi-Fi was too slow for her shows. His dad wasn't any better. He'd sit on our couch all day watching those weird conspiracy theory videos on YouTube with the volume cranked up. I work from home three days a week and couldn't focus on anything with him yelling at the T V. About lizard people or whatever. The worst part was dinner time. They expected me to cook for four people every single night, but never offered to help or buy groceries. I'd come home exhausted from work, and his mom would be like, oh, good, you're home. I'm starving. What's for dinner? Meanwhile, she spent the whole day doing absolutely nothing. I started keeping track of our grocery Bill. And it literally doubled. They were eating us out of house and home. His dad would finish entire boxes of cereal for breakfast, and his mom would make these huge sandwiches with, like, half a loaf of bread. When I brought it up to my husband, he just shrugged and said, they're going through a tough time. We need to be patient. But patient for what, exactly? Neither of them were even looking for jobs. They weren't apartment hunting. They weren't doing anything except making our lives miserable. The breaking point was when I found his mom going through our mail.

My daughter Ellie, at 16, started a small business making custom jewelry, mostly earrings and bracelets. She sold at local craft fairs and built a steady following online. Nothing crazy, just enough money to save up for college. Last summer, another mom from Ellie's school, Becky, ordered matching bracelets for herself and her daughters. Simple job. Ellie finished them in a day. Two weeks later, Becky showed up at our door, red faced and furious. He demanded Ellie refund her immediately, yelling about a severe allergic reaction caused by the bracelets. Ellie was mortified and apologized profusely, quickly refunding Becky. I didn't think much of it until Becky started bad mouthing Ellie online, tanking her reputation and ending the business overnight. I was angry, but let it go. Six months later, I ran into Becky's husband at the pharmacy. He saw me buying allergy medication and asked if I was okay. Confused, I mentioned Becky's bracelet reaction. He paused, then laughed bitterly. Bracelets? Becky never wore them. She sold them online. She used the money to buy diet pills that put her in the hospital. Turns out Becky had blamed Ellie to hide her secret shopping addiction from her husband. Ellie never restarted her business, but Becky's marriage imploded, accurately for the world. Danny and I had been getting close again, but we didn't want to rush anything. Then I got pregnant with Jake at 32, and We both cried when we found out. Happy tears, but also terrified tears. Because what if the cancer came back? It did. When Jake was two. I felt that same exhaustion creeping in. This time it was worse.

The kid was honestly pretty sweet when it was just the three of us hanging out, but the second her mom came into the picture, everything went to hell. Marcus and his ex wife had this weird custody thing where they never actually talk to each other directly. Everything went through Kayla, which was already messed up enough. But then his ex started using me as her personal messenger service. It started small. She'd text me instead of Marcus about pickup times or if Kayla forgot her backpack. I thought she was just being friendly at first, trying to include me since I was going to be Kayla's stepmom soon. But then it got weird. She'd send me these long messages about how Kayla was acting up at her house, how she needed new school clothes, how Marcus wasn't paying enough child support, stuff that had nothing to do with me. When I tell Marcus about it, he just shrug and say his ex was crazy and to ignore her. The breaking point came last Tuesday. I was at work when my phone started blowing up. Kayla's mom was texting me non stop because apparently Kayla had gotten in trouble at school for hitting another kid. The principal had called both parents, but Marcus wasn't answering his phone because he was in meetings all Day so his ex decides that I need to leave work immediately and go handle it. She's sending me message after message telling me I need to go pick up Kayla, that she can't leave her job, that this is what being a stepmom means. She even said I was being selfish for not dropping everything. I looked at my phone and just lost it. I texted back exactly what I was thinking. I told her that Kayla isn't my daughter, I'm not married to Marcus yet, and I'm not responsible for fixing their parenting disasters. I said she needed to figure out her own custody drama and leave me out of it. She immediately called Marcus screaming about how I was abandoning his daughter.

Some nights I'd find him literally sleeping face first in his dinner plate or passed out on the bathroom floor with the shower still running. Two nights ago, he finally stumbled through the door around midnight with this huge grin on his exhausted face. We did it, he said. Boss gave us the rest of the week off. He ate some leftover pizza, took the world's quickest shower and was snoring before his head hit the pillow. Next morning around 9, I made breakfast but let him sleep. Poor guy looked like a zombie for weeks. Around noon, my parents showed up unannounced. I'm six months pregnant, so they visit sometimes to check on me. We're sitting there having coffee when my mom asks where Tyler is. Since his truck's in the driveway, he's still sleeping, I said. My mom's face went all pinched. It's past noon. That's unacceptable with a pregnant wife. Wake him up. I explained the whole situation. Three weeks of hell. Fifty million dollar crisis. Barely any sleep. My dad just shook his head like Tyler was some lazy bum. I'm not waking him up, I said. He needs to rest. Well, if you won't do it, I will, my mom said, standing up and heading for the stairs. I jumped up and blocked her path. If you can't respect my husband getting proper sleep after three weeks of torture, then you need to leave our house now! Are you kicking us out?

But when Emma was 3, Danny's work schedule went completely insane. He was pulling 80 hour weeks, sometimes sleeping at the office. I was basically a single mom raising three kids while he chased some promotion that never came. We fought constantly. The house felt empty even when he was there because he was always on his phone or laptop. One night, after he missed Jake's first steps because of another emergency meeting, I told him I was done. We divorced six months later. It wasn't dramatic or messy, just sad. We both knew it wasn't working anymore. Two years later, I started feeling tired all the time. Like, couldn't get out of bed tired. Went to the doctor thinking it was stress or maybe low iron. Nope. Cancer. Age 2. At first, which scared the hell out of me, but felt manageable. Danny found out through Emma, who overheard me talking to my sister. He showed up at my door that same night with groceries and this look on his face, like someone had punched him in the gut. Why didn't you tell me? He kept asking. The funny thing is, going through chemo actually brought us closer than we'd been in years. He cut his hours way back to help with the kids and drive me to appointments. We'd sit in those awful hospital chairs for hours, just talking about random stuff. T V. Shows what the kids were doing. Stupid memories from when we were young. I beat it the first time. Remission at 31. And I felt like I could conquer.

While I've been blaming my body for failing us, you called our children. The words came out raw, broken. Your mother called me defective at Thanksgiving, asked if maybe we should explore other options. Your sister announced her third pregnancy at Christmas, and everyone looked at me with pity. My voice was rising even more. I refused my Promotion to reduce stress. I gave up coffee, wine, sushi, even my anxiety medication to increase the odds. Jasper opened his mouth. The doctor said stress could. Don't you dare! I cut him off. Don't you dare quote the doctors to me! Zane stood frozen. I did three rounds of Clomid that made me so sick I couldn't work. They shot dye through my fallopian tubes. Do you know how much that hurts, Jasper? While you were poisoning me, I was letting doctors torture me to find out why I couldn't stay pregnant. We named our babies. I continued, tears streaming. Now you remember how we picked them out together? Phoenix, Sage, Indigo, Xavier. I was knitting their baby blankets while you were making sure they'd never need them. Jasper's hands were trembling. Reaching out like he was the one who needed comfort.

I reached for my phone in my jacket pocket, but remembered I'd left it in my car after rushing in late from stopping for coffee. I'd overslept after staying up grading Essays until 2:00am. Can someone please tell me what's going on? I asked, hearing my voice crack slightly. The silence was deafening. Even Kevin, who never stopped talking, was staring at his desk. Finally, Ashley from the second row spoke up, her voice barely a whisper. Mister Peterson, did you. Did you not check the news this morning? No, I overslept. I barely made it here on time. My hands were starting to shake. Now. What happened? Ashley exchanged looks with Marcus, who shook his head violently, but she continued anyway, maybe you should call someone. Your family? Family? My parents

Now clean that up, he said, pointing to the broken glass jar he had dropped after stealing his employees tips. She started picking up glass on her knees, sobbing. Schiller kicked more glass toward her. Faster! I stood up, holding the heavy ceramic plate over my head. Yoo hoo! I whistled before dropping it onto the marble floor. Crash! Everyone gasped. What the? He spun around just as I picked up another plate and dropped it. Sir, what are you doing? That's $700 each! I shrugged, picked up the window glass and dropped it too. Then I walked over to the next table and swept everything off. Stop! Stop! I'm calling the police! Good! I said. Call them! I kept going. Schiller rushed over and grabbed my collar. You'll pay for every piece! And you'll pay for everything everyone has had to deal with under you! I grinned back at him as he blew up in my face. Everyone stood still, watching us, wondering the same thing. Why? Why I was a stranger suddenly throwing around plates? Well, it was for a good reason. The police arrived quickly, walking in, looking just as confused as everyone else was. Mister Schiller grinned, letting my collar go finally. Officers, arrest this man?

She's five months along, he said. Still time to make her doubt everything. My mouth went dry. What? He showed me his phone. Screenshots of Amy with some guy named Brad. Messages about meeting up, hotel reservations. The dates lined up with when our baby was conceived. These are fake. I said. Of course they are. His expression made my stomach turn. But she won't know that. When you confront her. Demand a paternity test. User of carrying another man's baby. The betrayal will break her. She'll leave you. You're insane.

I checked my phone. The fabricated messages looked professional, real. Delete them and I'll send them to her directly. Kyle said, play along, get 3,000. Fight me. She gets them with a note saying you hired someone to investigate her. Either way, your marriage ends tonight. Why would you do this to your own sister? That poker face got smugg. I always win 24 hours. They'd auto send to Amy if I didn't act tonight. I went straight home. Amy was reading baby names I like Grace. What do you think? My throat felt like sandpaper. I told her everything. Her face changed completely. Happy to confused to furious. She grabbed my phone, stared at the forged conversations. These are fake, she whispered.

Pictures of me with Brad, messages that never happened. I don't know what you're talking about. But if he's showing you fabricated evidence, that's concerning. Has he been questioning the baby?

I work IT support for the whole building, fixing everyone's computers and network issues. Every single day during our lunch break, point out different guys walking through the lobby and just tear them apart. You look at his receding hairline. Why do bald guys even think they have a chance with someone like me? Or that guy from marketing is so short. Or miles from accounting keeps bring me coffee. But seriously, look at that dad bought at 25. He probably still lives with his mom in the basement playing video games. And it wasn't just casual comments either. She'd take pics of guys from the company directory and send them to our group chat with crying laughing emojis. This guy from HR asked me out yesterday. Can you believe the audacity? She'd rate them out of 10 like she was some kind of celebrity judge on a reality show. The thing is, Zoe works reception. She answers phones, signs for packages, and schedules conference rooms. She's not exactly climbing the corporate ladder here, but she acts like she's the CEO's daughter who deserves nothing but investment bankers and male models. Walking straight out of GQ magazine. Last Monday I'm in her cubicle fixing her computer because she somehow managed to get 17 different toolbars installed, plus some suspicious browser extensions. While I'm running malware scans and updating her antivirus, she starts her usual lunch routine, pointing out guys walking by the reception desk. Oh, god, there's miles again with his pathetic daily coffee delivery. Look at him. Dad bod, cheap Supercuts haircut. Probably drives his mom's Honda Civic with the dented bumper.

Guess who came begging for help? I was born two months premature and stayed small my whole life. 90 pounds through high school, while my brother came out 11 months later looking like he was meant for a Nike commercial. Dad immediately decided which son was worth his time by middle school. My brother's the star quarterback and I'm still getting mistaken for someone's little sister at the grocery store. Freshman year I tried joining J V. Football to be part of something, and during tryouts my brother walks over from varsity practice and tells the coach in front of everyone that weakness is contagious and I'll make the whole team soft. Coach actually listens to a 14 year old because my brother's already locally famous. Dad hears about this at dinner and instead of defending me he laughs and says my brother has a point, even suggest I try chess club instead. I get a job at the local gym cleaning the equipment just to be around fitness. My brother brings his teammates there specifically to point at me mopping and tell them not to get too close or my weak jeans might jump onto them. They all laugh like it's the funniest thing they've ever heard. Senior year my brother gets a full ride scholarship to date and my parents throw a huge party I only found out about through Instagram and when I asked dad why I wasn't invited He said it was for athletes only. I start working out at 3 in the morning when nobody's around to laugh, and gym owner notices my dedication and offers to train me for free. First year I gained 15 pounds of muscle, which isn't much, but it's something. I start posting progress videos online with hashtag contagious strength because I'm petty and it feels good. My brother wins state championship his senior year, but tears his ACL in his first college game.

The only reason he even volunteered for the camping trip was to co chaperone with the beautiful Miss Dizon. But of course, don't let his wife know, right? So while he was there trying to impress her with his wilderness expertise, a baby bear cub wandered into our campsite, sniffing around me and the other students. He stumbled back and pointed at it. Mister V, there's a bear! He yelled in a high pitched voice. Mister IV looked over and laughed at our worried expression. Are you seriously scared of a little moving build? A bear? It's smaller than my Labrador. He walked over and picked up the cub on the back of its neck and held it up like a stop animal, winking at Miss I Dizon. See? You kids need to toughen up when we get back to school. 10 laps, all of you! He laughed as the cub cried and squealed before kicking it into the bushes. There, done. Now everyone go to bed. When we tried to say something, he cut us off. Anyone who disrupts adult conversation gets detention for a week. He turned to Miss Dizon, who was sitting by the fire. These city kids are so dramatic. Wanna check out the stars by the lake? Better view away from all these tents. I giggled and stood up. Lead the way. When they were gone, all of us looked at each Other with wide eyes. We all knew something bad was going to happen. I hate to be the bringer of bad news, Daphne said, cutting through the tension, but didn't our biology teacher warn us that a baby bear always mean the mother is nearby? Another kid with glasses nodded. My uncle survived a bear attack and told us never to mess with a cub. So what should we do? While we all stood there trying to figure out what to do, the smart kid Alex, started moving all our food and coolers to an empty tent opposite from where we were sleeping. Are you guys gonna help or what? We practically sprang into action, carrying all our snacks into the same tent, filling it up like we were making an offering to some local deity. Mr. V snuck up on us and yelled, what are you doing with all the food?

No contact with family. My sister Tara got a German Shepherd for her 16th birthday. I got a card. The dog's name was Jack's and he cost $3,000 from a champion bloodline. My parents built him a heated dog house that cost more than my car. When Jax bit me the first week, dad said I must have bothered him. Jax killed my childhood cat, peaches, three months later. I'd raised peaches from a kitten bottle, fed her when she was abandoned. I found her lifeless in the backyard one morning. My parents shrugged and said cats were boring anyway, that dogs had personality. They refused to let me bury her properly because it might upset Jax to smell another animal in his yard. I buried peaches at my friend's house and cried alone. I paid for my own college, working three jobs. Sarah dropped out sophomore year to become a dog trainer. She'd never trained Jax to even sit yet. My parents bought her a 40 thousand dollar mobile grooming van for her new career. The business lasted two months. I graduated nursing school with honours. My parents couldn't make it to graduation. Jax's had a vet appointment when Tara's dog turned 1. They threw a party with 50 guests. Then Jax attacked my neighbour's poodle. My parents paid the vet bills and bought Tara a second German Shepherd to keep Jax's company. When I asked for help with my textbooks, mom said, that's My responsibility. The second dog's name was Athena. She was worse than Jax. Together, they destroyed my childhood bedroom. During Thanksgiving, I found peaches hidden toys under my bed torn to shreds. My parents laughed and said, dogs will be dogs. Everything unraveled when I met Steven. We dated two years before getting engaged. My parents said they were thrilled, but never asked about wedding plans. When I mentioned wedding costs, they suggested courthouse ceremonies were more intimate. At the same time, Tara announced Jack's needed surgery for hip dysplasia. My parents spent $15,000 without blinking. Then Jack's destroyed my wedding dress. During the fitting, Tara had brought him to my appointment uninvited. He jumped on me with muddy paws and tore the train clean off. The dress was ruined.

Every disaster in this house happens because you're constantly provoking Gonzales. I stared in disbelief while my 14 year old brother Gonzales sat there looking innocent. The kitchen fire last week, the destroyed laptop, the hole in the garage door. It's always when you two are together. We need peace. You have two weeks to find somewhere else to live. Gonzalez smiled sweetly. I just want our family to be safe, he said, hiding behind my parents backs as he mouth goodbye. Fine. If they wanted me to stop protecting them from Hurricane Gonzalez, I'd wish them good luck. The day after I moved out, Gonzalez decided to upgrade the house's electrical system. Every light in the neighborhood now flickered in rhythm with our toaster. When mom tried to make toast. It activated the garage door, the ceiling fans, and somehow started Dad's car. The power company had to shut down our entire grid and rewire our house. The Bill was $3,000. It's synchronized living, Gonzalez explained proudly to the electrician. Next, he discovered online chemistry tutorials without me. Secretly replacing his chemicals with baking soda, he created what he called rainbow smoke bombs in the kitchen. But they were actually just straight up acid that ate through the tiles and corrupted all the food. Hazmat had to gut our kitchen entirely. Total cost $8,000. Why didn't you tell us this would happen? Mom yelled at me through the phone. I did. You just never listened. I reminded her. Then Gonzales revealed he'd been training squirrels in the attic. They're my army, he explained, as 20 squirrels wearing tiny tin foil hats descended through the ceiling during Dad's Zoom meeting with his boss. Dad got fired on the spot. Then came the car improvement.

And my daughter, the actual mother of the baby, who had swore this time she'd stay and watch over her, nowhere to be found. I was shocked, furious, in desperate tears as I scooped her up and called for an ambulance. The nurses took her for a CT scan immediately while I filled out forms with shaking hands. Is she going to be okay? Please tell me she's going to be okay, I begged. Where did this happen? The intake nurse asked coolly. I hesitated. At home, she fell off the couch.

I opened up Instagram from my phone and found her post from an hour ago. Enjoying a nice smooch with a stranger at a music festival. How long was the baby unsupervised? The doctor asked when he came out. Maybe a few hours. I kept calling my daughter. Straight to voicemail every time the hospital called. The Police. In the meantime, a social worker approached me in the waiting room and called my daughter on her personal phone. This isn't normal for her, I tried to explain. She's young. She's still figuring things out. The social worker just stared at me, expressionless. When my daughter picked up, she spoke bluntly. Your baby is in the hospital, and that custody of yours is hanging on a thread. So show up, Bam! And call. The social worker pulled out her tablet. Now let's talk about what normal looks like. How often do you watch the baby? Well, at first it was just during classes, and now I bit my lip. More often she waited? Yes, okay, every night. But I'm her mother. And I'm that baby's grandmother. You got how to understand I. When was the last time your daughter spent a full 24 hours with her baby? She interrupted writing out a long list on her case file. When I couldn't answer, she scribbled even more on her clip.

So I treated her exactly like I treat my other friends. With boundaries. Tara and I had been together for two years, living together, for one. We were talking about future plans, her sister's wedding next summer, where I was supposed to be her plus one. Then on a random Thursday evening, she sat me down for the talk. I love you, but I'm not in love with you anymore. She said, I think we should transition to being friends. Get along so well, have the same friend group. We'd make amazing friends. But not amazing partners. Here's what killed me. She said all this while already having packed a bag. Her friend Marissa was picking her up in an hour. She planned this whole thing down to having somewhere to stay. You've already got an exit strategy? I said, we're adults. We're friends. We can make this work. I sat there processing two years living together, talking about kids someday. Now she wants to be buddies? Okay. I said, yeah, let's be friends. She actually smiled, relieved, like I just agreed to her perfect plan where she gets to dump me but keep all the benefits of having me in her life. The next morning, I did exactly what Tara asked. I treated her like a friend. That's when I Learned she had a very different definition of friendship than I did. First text at 7:00am. Could you Drop off my work laptop? Sure. I'll leave it at the front desk of your office Monday. Can't you bring it by Marissa's? I need it for the weekend. I've got plans. Monday works better. She didn't like that. But what was she going to say? We're just friends now. Week 2, Tara started cracking. She showed up at the apartment while I was at work. Still using her key. Helped herself to groceries, did laundry, took a shower. I texted her, I'll need the key back. My friends don't have keys to my place. This is ridiculous. We live together. We used to live together. Now we're friends. Different relationship, different boundaries. She came by that evening, furious. You changed the locks. You no longer live here. Here's a box of your stuff. I'm treating you exactly like I treat my friends. None of them have keys to my place. But I'm not just any friend. According to you, that's exactly what you are. The real kicker came at game night with our friend group. I showed up solo. She showed up with some dude named Connor from yoga, clearly trying to make me jealous. I shook his hand, welcomed him, then needed to destroy everyone at code names while paying them zero attention. Halfway through the night, Tara cornered me. You don't even care that I'm here with someone else? Why would I? We're friends. Friends date people. She couldn't answer because there was no answer that didn't Admit she wanted me to pine for her while she found herself. But the best part, her bestie Marissa had been extra friendly all night. Kept finding excuses to talk to me, laugh at my jokes. This morning, Tara texted. What was that with you and Marissa? We were just talking. Friends talk. She's my best friend. And I'm your friend, too, right? Friends can be friends with each other's friends. By week three, Connor from yoga had ghosted Tara. Meanwhile, Marissa invited me to a comedy show. The date was fantastic. She was actually hilarious. Something I'd

I work in semiconductors, where precision matters in circuits and apparently not in HR complaints. This started when management moved a new girl, 22, to my department, and I, thirty four, had to train her. This woman had quite the reputation around our facility. Multiple guys had mysteriously disappeared from the company after working with her, with whispered break room stories about false reports and HR drama following in her wake. Her personnel file probably needed its own storage cabinet at this point. From day one, her behavior was off. At first, she was oddly shy around me, but that quickly evolved into something else entirely. As the days passed, she got increasingly flirtatious and super hands on. All touchy feely. She'd even mention how cute she thought I was and so on. I'll admit I did play along with her, but never in any kind of inappropriate way. She added me on social media and we swapped info since she'd mentioned wanting to hang out. So I guess one weekend she saw on social media that I'd gone to the park. When Monday rolled around, the atmosphere had shifted dramatically. She barely spoke to me, slammed equipment down, and gave me death glares across the clean room. Turns out she was mad that I didn't call her, which felt really immature and honestly just nuts. Especially since we never actually made any real plans or anything. A few Weeks later, that same flirty energy was still going strong. Then I ended up out sick for a few days with a nasty stomach bug. I couldn't keep anything down, not even water. So I stayed home.

I'm a courthouse security guard. And last Tuesday, this guy in a three thousand dollar suit storms past metal detector, setting off every alarm. When I try stopping him, he shoves me aside hard enough that I stumble backward into the well. I'm late for my hearing. Touch me again and you're fired. Do you know who I am? Turns out he's Marcus Wellington, tech CEO whose company Data Vault got sued for stealing employee pensions.

Designer shoes clicking loudly on marble floors. But he's so entitled and distracted by his platinum iPhone that he doesn't realize something major has changed since last appearance. The judge stops mid sentence and stares at him over her glasses. Mr. Wellington, you're 40 minutes late to your own criminal trial. Traffic was absolutely terrible, your honor. My driver took some ridiculous detour. Anyway, let's get this pathetic joke over with. How much do I need to pay these losers to make this frivolous lawsuit disappear? The entire courtroom goes dead silent. You could hear a pin drop. His own defense attorney, some fancy lawyer in an Armani suit, is frantically making shut up gestures and sliding urgent papers toward him. But Marcus waves him off without even glancing down. Honestly, if these people were actually Smart enough to read their employment contracts properly? They wouldn't be working minimum wage jobs for me in the first place. This is basic business literacy. A middle aged woman in the gallery, clearly one of his former employees, starts crying quietly. Marcus notices her tears and actually laughs out loud. Oh come on, Karen, you worked at Data Vault for three years. You absolutely had to know what you were signing when you handed over your pension contributions. He pulls out his latest iPhone Pro and starts casually scrolling.

I was 19, sitting in a police station at 3:00am with bloody knuckles, watching my best friend's dad walk through the door to bail me out instead of my own father. The fluorescent lights made everything look worse. Swollen eye. The dried blood on my white T-shirt. The disappointment in Officer Rivera's eyes as she processed my paperwork. She'd known me since I was a kid, shooting hoops at the community center where she volunteered. Two hours earlier, I'd thrown the first punch at a guy who wouldn't stop harassing a girl at a party. I didn't know her. Didn't matter. She'd said no 14 times. I counted. And when he grabbed her wrist, something in me snapped. My fist connected with his jaw, and suddenly five guys were on me. I remembered the crack of my head against the coffee table, the taste of blood, someone yelling to call the cops. My parents hadn't answered my call. They never did when it was late. Their way of teaching responsibility. Three missed calls to my dad, straight to voicemail. So I called Mitch, my best friend since fifth grade. The guy who shared his lunch with me every day in middle school when my parents got to give me lunch money. When I saw his dad walk in, still in pajama pants, with his hair sticking up on one side, exhaustion in his eyes, shame hit me harder than any punch. From the fight, Mister Davis signed papers without complaint, noted respectfully to Officer Rivera, and motioned for me to follow him out. He didn't lecture me during the silent drive, just asked if I was hungry and pulled into Denny's, the only 24 hour diner in our small town. The waitress, Shelly, knew him by name, brought his coffee without asking. Your dad called me back, he said, finally, stirring his coffee methodically, the spoon clinking against ceramic in the empty restaurant. Told me to let you sit in jail until morning. Build character, were his words. Stared at my untouched pancakes, eyes burning with tears I refused to let fall. 19 years old and still hoping for a father who would show up. I'm sorry, I managed to say.

I became a parent at 7 years old, the day I realized my sister Eve would starve if I didn't learn to cook. Our parents worked 18 hour days and treated the office like their real home, while I Learned to pack Eve's lunch in the specific blue container she needed and her sandwiches into perfect triangles. By 9, I could forge their signatures perfectly and knew exactly how to calm her meltdowns. By 16, I scheduled her doctor visits and set alarms to give her medicine on time. Eve would fall asleep by the front door waiting for them to come home, rocking with her weighted blanket. And I'd carry her to bed at midnight, whispering that I'd always be there, even if they weren't. So when Stanford accepted me, I stared at the letter, knowing I couldn't leave her alone for two more years of high school. She caught me crying and grabbed my shoulders. You have to go. I don't like when you're sad, she said, rocking slightly. Parents suddenly appeared when they heard Stanford's name, actually proud for once and lecturing me about opportunities I couldn't pass up. But I told them I couldn't leave Eve alone, not when she needed someone who understood her routines and could advocate for her at school. For the first time in years, they actually look at me, and I watched something break in Mom's face. Oh, god, she whispered. You've been doing our job since second grade. All this time working to afford the best life for you two, and we haven't even been here to live it with you. Dad couldn't look at me when he finally spoke. Starting tomorrow, being here comes first. And for three beautiful months, they became the best parents. Dad Learned Eve's morning routine, mom attended parent teacher conferences, and they both showed up to her sophomore year orientation. Eve called me at Stanford listing every dinner detail they used. The smooth plates. Dad didn't mix her foods. Mom turned the TV volume to 16, not 17. They and photos of themselves at her art showcase. And Eve's smile in those pictures made the homesickness worth it. She even called one night. Very serious. I have a boyfriend, mom, and dad like him. He helps me at school. I felt grateful hearing her sound happy about normal teenage things. But when I came home two years later for her graduation, I realized she was living anything but a normal.

I had this one kid in my class whose IQ was probably a few points higher than Homer Simpsons. I found this on my first day when he took out a blender, then interrupted class to ask if anyone had any fruit so he could make a smoothie. That same day, I left the class for a minute to laminate something, and when I came back, he was at my desk eating my lunch. He said that he needed something to eat with his drink and thought it was out there for everyone to snack on. Two weeks later, during his first test, he wrote your name beside the write your name heading at the top. He was by far the worst performing student in the class because he was always on his phone, even during tests. Whenever he'd stay after school to catch up on work, he'd tell me he's always on his phone because he's making money. At the time, I just brushed it off and told him he still can't use it in class. But one day, in the middle of a test, he screamed, oh, my god! Yes! In one motion, he stood up and took off running to the bathroom, accidentally knocking down the girl who was in the chair beside him. He came back 10 minutes later, and I told him to stay behind after class. I asked him what that was. All about. And he went on to tell me that when he said he makes money on his phone during class, he wasn't lying. He then told me that he does that stock trading thing and said while checking his green and red arrows, I noticed one of his stocks boomed and made him a lot of money. I didn't believe a word, but then he showed me the proof. He opened an app called Bloom in front of me and showed me his portfolio. This kid who was genuinely failing Algebra 1, had made over $400 profit in a couple of months. He told me he started from zero and just use the rewards the app gives you to start. I was sort of interested by this and asked him if he could give me some tips to start myself. He replied, I don't really know what I'm doing. Just get bloom.

When I was in elementary school, my best friend was a girl named Raquel. And because I was a very anxious and shy kid, I let her walk all over me. I did her homework for her and gave her the treats out of my lunch. And in return, she'd throw me under the bus constantly. I remember people started rumors about me and my family, but instead of defending me, she laughed at me with them. The worst part was how the very next day, she'd come up to me acting like nothing happened, and then once again asked me to do her homework. We're best friends, and best friends do things for each other, she'd say. There was one time she began punching my arm for seemingly no reason, so I grabbed her hands to make her stop. She suddenly began crying loudly, and everyone came to her defense, including our teacher, who told me, why don't you back off? I think you did enough for today. I was kept alone in the classroom during lunchtime, and when everyone came back, there was a rumor that I had tried to choke her to death. I tried to tell everyone I just held onto her hands when she was punching me, but no one believed me. And there she was in the middle of the crowd, not saying a word, taking in all the love and attention from the Class. I somehow finally came to my senses when we were 8. She invited me for a sleepover at her place. We were watching Pirates of the Caribbean, fangirling over Johnny Depp, when at one point during the movie, she told me I could rest my head on her if I felt tired. I did just that towards the end of the movie, and she shrugged me off of her. I asked why she did that, and she said, I never said you could put your head on me. If you do this again, I'll stab you.

When I was 12, I called CPS, but not to protect myself. I just been adopted by a couple who could never have their own kids. And they seem so nice. At first, they never yelled at me like my bio mom or dad did. They gave me ice cream just for existing. And they tucked me into bed with hot chocolate by my bedside every night. I was convinced any kid would be lucky to have them as parents. That's why when I found out they had miraculously gotten pregnant, I cheered. However, that's when things changed. It was like a switch. But not in the way they treated me, rather, in the way they treated him. My adoptive parents instantly became obsessed with Raising Jacob as this perfect and gifted child. They hung this huge chart in the kitchen marking every milestone the day they took him from the hospital. If Jacob didn't sit up, walk, or talk exactly when the internet said he should, they get this anxious look and start whispering to each other. By the time Jacob was nine months old, they were already making him do these daily flashcards. I watched from the hallway as my dad sighed heavily whenever Jacob got distracted or confused. It felt weird and uncomfortable, but I thought maybe they were just stressed out about being new parents. It got worse when Jacob turned 2. They signed him up For these advanced toddler classes, trying to teach him Latin on top of English at home, they spent hours drilling him on letters and numbers. If Jacob got something wrong, they tense up, their faces showing clear disappointment. Sometimes Jacob would cry at night. Instead of comforting him, they'd stand over his crib with their arms folded until he stopped. They said it would build character. I started noticing how anxious Jacob got all the time. He'd pick nervously at his fingers. His eyes always looked like he was waiting for someone to yell at him. One night after a preschool meeting, I heard his teacher mention that Jacob was struggling socially. On the drive home, my parents lectured Jacob non stop about embarrassing the family. He sat silently in his car seat, tears rolling down his cheeks. From that day, dinner became a nightmare. Jacob was no longer allowed to eat until he perfectly recited whatever they drilled him on that day.

Lucy called me instead of our parents because I was only 10 minutes away while they were both at work. I rushed to the pharmacy and grabbed pads, tampons, and even some chocolate because I wasn't sure what she needed. Got to the school in eight minutes flat. Lucy was hiding behind the gym building, tears streaming down her face, trying to cover the stain on her shorts with her backpack. I met her at the side gate and handed her the bag through the fence. He thanked me and ran inside to the bathroom. I waited in my car to make sure she was okay, playing some music and texting my mom about what happened. Everything seemed fine, then I saw this older teacher walking toward my car. He looked angry and was talking on his phone. Within minutes, three more staff members surrounded my Honda as security guard knocked on my window and told me to step out immediately. The teacher said he witnessed me talking to a distressed female student behind the building. He claimed the girl looked scared and ran away after I gave her something. They asked for my ID and started questioning me about why I was On school property during class hours. I tried explaining that Lucy was my sister, but they weren't listening.

My dad missed my graduation for a job interview. Mom promised he'd make it, but kept checking her phone anxiously during the entire ceremony. I felt my heart sink when I scanned the crowd and didn't see his face anywhere. After walking across that stage, I gripped my phone, waiting for something. No texts, no calls. Complete silence. Mom couldn't look me in the eyes when I found her afterward, she hugged me way too tight and whispered, he really tried, sweetheart. My chest burned with anger. I couldn't hide anymore. At my graduation party, relatives kept asking about dad. Mom cycled through increasingly desperate excuses. Traffic jam, work emergency, car trouble, each lie more pathetic than the last. I watched her stumble through explanations while my shame grew deeper. My friend Jake pulled me aside and asked, you doing okay, man? I just laughed and said, he's been doing this since I was 7 years old, because it was absolutely true. He missed my championship basketball game where I scored the winning shot. Missed my debate team finals when I took first place. Even missed my 18th birthday party last year. Said he had to work late again that night. After everyone finally left, I sat alone staring at my diploma. Mom tried approaching me, but I cut her off immediately. David, I said, grabbing my car keys, I've heard every excuse before.

And in it she admitted she'd lied about who my real father was. My dad Trevor, had always been this gentle guy who worked nights at the factory and came home smelling like metal and machine oil. Mom would heat up his dinner plate at 2:00am when his shift ended. He'd kiss my forehead before I went to school, even when I pretended to be asleep. Normal dad stuff. But I always wondered why I looked nothing like him. I'm tall with dark hair and green eyes. Dad's short with blond hair and brown eyes. Mom always said I got lucky with the gene pool. That sometimes kids just look different. I believed her, because what kid questions that? When Grandma Rose died last month, she left me this speed up leather diary from 1987. I almost threw it away until I found the page with my name on it. She'd written about the night I was born. How mom was crying in the hospital room, begging grandma to never tell anyone the truth about who my real father was. Turns out my actual father is Mom's boss at the insurance office where she worked before I was born. His name is David Walsh. Grandma wrote that mom had an affair with him for six months when she got pregnant. He wanted nothing to do with it. He was married with two kids of his own. Mom was terrified and ashamed. So when Trevor asked her to marry him three months later, she said yes and never told him I wasn't his. I sat in my car outside Mom's house for an hour, holding that diary, trying to figure out what to say. When I finally went inside, she was folding laundry in the living room. I just put the diary on the coffee table and watched her face go white. She didn't even try to deny it. She just started crying and said she never wanted me to find out because Trevor had been such a good father to me. She begged me not to tell him because it would destroy him. The weird part was, I wasn't even angry at her. I was angry at this David guy who basically abandoned me before I was even born. So I looked him up online. He still works at the same insurance.

Supposedly out of excitement, she messaged all the guests on our list asking for male specific gifts. So on the day of the gender reveal party, everyone's cheers and surprised expressions felt so uncomfortably forced. I felt that something was clearly off, but ignored it until I started opening up all the gifts. They all turned out specifically oddly specific for male babies.

My 13 year old son, Lucas got invited to a birthday party at the local community pool. This was a huge deal. Lucas is autistic and struggles with sensory overload, but he's been working hard in therapy lately. He's been asking constantly to do normal kid things, and when his classmate Henry asked him to come, there was no way I was saying no. I spent days getting him ready. We talked through possible scenarios, practiced ways to cope, and packed his noise canceling headphones. I even reached out to Henry's mom to make sure she knew Lucas might need breaks or might have to head out early. When we arrived, he hesitated at the gate, grabbed my hand, and whispered, mom, I'm nervous, but I really wanna try. My heart nearly burst. Everything was perfect. Lucas stayed in the shallow end, laughing with two other boys. He ate cake without getting overwhelmed by the singing. I started to relax, watching from a distance so he could feel independent. Then some teenagers cannonballed right next to him. The splash, screaming, and sudden chaos triggered him instantly. I saw his face change, that distant look I know too well. He started stimming, flapping his hands and making his high pitched humming sound. I rushed over, but before I could reach him, Lucas was in full meltdown. He covered his ears, screaming and rocking. The other parents stared. Some kids backed away. While others whispered and pointed. When I finally reached him, I saw a teenage girl recording us on her phone. I snapped, stop filming my son! She stopped and walked off. Two days later, a parent messaged me. Their kid had shown them a video on TikTok. The clip showed Lucas's meltdown, no context at all, with laughing, crying emojis.

She screamed out that I was being selfish and was just a stupid teenager who needed to learn how to listen to my parents. When she gave up, she filmed me crying in the stall, pretending to be a caring person by giving me space to control my emotions. Afterwards, she called me difficult and took my phone privileges away for a week. When I got it back, I started recording everything.

And I swear, my baby Annalise looked 23 years old. And as we sat down, the waiter began to flirt with her. I wasn't really paying attention because I figured she'd turn him down or just act really shy. But in the corner of my eye, I saw her batting her eyes and looking up at him with a single finger twirling her hair. Motherly rage flooded my system. I literally saw the bulge in his pants. Hey, do you guys have a birthday candle with the No. 15? Because that's how old my daughter is turning today. Luckily, the guy went super red and started stammering, so I knew that he had simply been blindsided. And we even got switched to a new later. As for my daughter, I didn't want to ruin her birthday, so I let her change the topic, and we just Talked about something else. But when she woke up the next day, I asked her what the f she thought she was doing. That she could wear what she wanted, but there was no way I'd ever let her date anyone over the age of 17. We did that teenage angst thing where they pinch the bridge of their nose and roll their eyes like. It was the most original move in the book. So I grabbed her phone and unlocked it with her facial recognition. This time, something in her eyes changed. She begged me not to go through it. It was a good effort, but not good enough. I love you. And if you were a mother, you'd do the same thing. I then walked into my room and locked the door. There wasn't anything too bad. I did find what people call thirst traps on her TikTok, but her account was private and her following was mostly girls. The worrying part was her Instagram. There were bikini pictures plastered everywhere with extremely intimate songs and angles.

Jokes on you, I'll sit here till the end of time. It was the late 90s. I was still drowning in flannel and keeping up my lifelong habit of hoarding library books way past their due date. I had a paper to write for my sophomore global studies class, so, of course, I checked out more books than I could possibly get through, wrote the essay, then totally forgot about the stack gathering dust in the corner of my room. After a steady stream of overdue notices showing up in my homeroom, I finally returned the four or five books one sunny afternoon via the anonymous drop box during a study hall, then promptly moved on to bigger and better things. About two weeks later, I was called down to the assistant principal's office. In that space of time before classes officially started that was reserved for one thing and one thing only. The reprobates and delinquents were in trouble. I walked the halls thinking that surely this was just a timing mishap, and I was being summoned to receive congratulations for some kind of award I didn't know I had entered into competition for. Yep, he just wants to prepare me for the surprise ticker tape parade. I was wholly unprepared to hear that I was receiving lunch detention to start immediately, because I had not returned a single book that I still remember was slim and had a white and red cover from My G S. Paper research. I tried to argue that there was a mistake, since I was sure, like I am sure that I have fingertips, I had returned it, but he could not be moved, and I was sentenced to indefinite lunch detention until I either return the book or paid the 16 bucks to replace it. I left the office late for first period, defeated, but kept my head held high at lunch later that day, as I walked past the entirety of the cafeteria, which held a couple hundred of my peers, plastic food tray in hand, I went down the hall to the old shop classroom that had since been moved and the awaiting detention. I checked in with missus brown at her desk in front and took an inconspicuous seat in the back, staring down at my canned peach slices. I braced for the worst. A murderous ruckus was going to break out any minute, I could tell. But once my ears stopped ringing, I discovered that it was really a calm escape from the crowded and rowdy.

Here, let me show you something. I'm driving to work a few months ago. Almost there. Two turns left, maybe half a mile total. Just neighborhood streets, nothing fancy. This guy in a black BMW crawls up my ass and stays there. I can see him in my mirror, phone in one hand, making these angry faces at me like I personally ruined his morning. I speed up a bit. 5 over the limit. He gets closer. Now he's maybe two feet from my bumper, still checking his phone every few seconds. Real genius move there, buddy. Anyway, I take the first turn, and now I'm on the street where my building is probably about 600 yards ahead. The assholes still tailing me, riding just inches from my bumper, and clearly pissed that I'm still sticking to the speed limit. Maybe around 35 on this stretch. So I press the gas a bit and sure enough, he matches my speed. I drive an 8 year old Toyota truck. Not huge, not tiny, just a regular truck that's seen some shit. All terrain tires, decent suspension, and I've definitely treated it like a truck should be treated. Pastures, rocks, curbs. My baby's been through it all. So as I'm getting closer to my building, there's this big speed bump in the road meant to slow people down before they reach the parking garage entrances. I plants back and yep, assholes still glued to my bumper. I remember thinking, I've got to ease up for this speed bump, and then thinking again, if I hit the brakes, this guy's gonna plow right into me. That's when the plan starts to form in my head. And I hit the gas. I'm going about 45 when I hit that speed bump and Yeehaw! Caught a little air and came down hard. Never even touched the brakes. Didn't tap him once. Gave him absolutely no heads up for what was coming. I'm locked on my rearview mirror through the whole thing cause I wanted to catch his reaction. He's got his phone.

After what I saw today, I'm quitting my job for good. Most people think YouTube is just a website to watch cat videos or makeup tutorials, but behind closed doors, there are thousands of disturbing videos that never make the homepage. It's my job to make sure it stays that way. You would think after watching thousands of these gruesome videos, I would build some type of tolerance. But after what I just saw on a random channel, I'm convinced that I'm gonna die soon. The channel was called marbles, and it didn't have a profile picture or bio, but what it did have were four videos with creepy titles and weird thumbnails. When I first saw the videos, I couldn't make out what the thumbnails were because the images were too pixelated. Thought it'd just be another person uploading abuse videos or someone making staged content to shock people, but I was dead wrong. The first video was titled doggy, and all it showed was just footage of a sleeping dog. No violence, no audio, and literally nothing. I watched it five times to see what the problem was, but I couldn't find anything, so I reinstated the video and moved on to the next one. But that's when things got creepier, because this video was titled six PM and it showed a man walking through a forest. His breathing was off and the camera was shaky, but then out Of nowhere, the video cut to him standing still while he wore a mask and stared down at the camera. His eyes didn't blink, and it felt like he was staring straight into my soul. The third video was called clouds, and this time the camera was pointed down while someone was lying on the ground with their legs cut off. He was screaming in pain for the first 30 seconds, but just when I thought I saw it all, he stopped screaming completely, looked directly at the camera, and whispered something before the video went black. I couldn't tell what he said because he was too quiet, but that didn't matter. The video clearly violated the terms of service, so I immediately removed the video and decided to watch the last one. The fourth video was called Bad Day, and this time the first three minutes were just footage of a blank white wall. I thought it would be a repeat of the first video where nothing happened, but right as I was about to click off the same.

I'm now convinced I'm going to be dead tomorrow. I was just eating pizza a few nights ago when out of nowhere I got an email replying to my audio technician job listing on Craigslist. I was super excited to finally have some interest in my work, but when I saw that the pay was $100,000 for just three days of work, I was a bit skeptical. I thought this was just a fake email and was about to click off until I saw that there was an audio file attached underneath. We've listened to your samples and your sound processing skills are exactly what we're looking for. If you're interested in the job, please reply within 48 hours. Additionally, you will need to sign an NDA before you accept the position. After listening to the audio, I assumed I was just wrong about it being fake and decided I was willing to sign whatever I needed to. But the second I opened up the NDA to get some more details on the job, I found that one of the clauses said I would need to sign a waiver with a fine print saying that I might die. I had a bad feeling about it, but I only had 80 cents to my name and needed the money, so I signed it anyway. The moment I finished, I got an email from the company with an address under the text Come to this location tomorrow at 8:00am to start working with us. I didn't think much of it and went to sleep. When I woke up the next day, I put on a suit, wear my brand new Cologne, and started driving over to the location. But when I pulled into the parking lot, I knew something was off because there were no signs, no windows, and the location looked almost deserted. I figured I was probably just early, but the second I stepped inside the building, a super weird woman called Elizabeth came up to me, put me inside a creepy room, and said, you'll soon understand why we had you sign that death waiver. Was already regretting coming here, but it was too late. After a couple minutes passed by, she introduced me to this guy called Darren, who looked like he hadn't slept in like 20 years. Before I could even ask what the hell I was supposed to do, Darren pointed to a weird black box in the corner with a speaker and keyboard attached to it. That device can hear the dead. I immediately started laughing in his face and even glanced around for cameras, hoping all of this was just a

My wife Jenna has this thing where she's always late. Not just fashionably late, but, like, 30 to 45 minutes late to everything. Dinner with friends, movies, work meetings, family gatherings. You name it, she's gonna be late for it. It drives me absolutely insane. The worst part is how she acts about it like it's no big deal. She'll roll her eyes when I tell her we need to leave, say, relax, babe, we have time when we absolutely don't, and then get mad at me for being stressed about it. Started telling her events start an hour earlier than they actually do, but she caught on and now just shows up even later. Last month was the breaking point. We were supposed to meet my parents for my dad's birthday dinner at this nice restaurant. I told her we needed to leave by 6:30 to get there on time. At 7:15, she's still doing her makeup, telling me to chill out because they'll wait for us. He showed up at 8:20. My parents had already ordered appetizers and were halfway through their main course. My dad looked hurt, my mom was pissed, and I wanted to disappear. But two weeks ago, something happened that Jenna had been talking about for months. Her favorite singer was doing this acoustic set at a tiny venue. Downtown. She'd been refreshing the ticket page for weeks trying to get seats, and somehow managed to snag two tickets when someone canceled last minute. She was beyond excited, posting about it on Instagram every day, telling everyone at work about it. The show was at 8 p m. On a Saturday. The venue was small.

Emma was frantically texting me links to normal name lists. Kyle's dad kept muttering Nebuchadnezzar under his breath like he was trying to practice saying it. For the next three weeks I got calls every single day. Janet would call with alternative suggestions like Theodore or Michael. Emma sent me a 47 item list of actually cute names that aren't completely insane. Even Kyle's normally quiet aunt called to tell me about a nice couple she knew who named their daughter brunhilda, and she got teased terribly in school. The best part was watching them try to be supportive while obviously dying inside at the grocery store. Janet introduced me to her friend as my daughter in law. Who's expecting little Bartholomew or brinhilda? The poor woman didn't know what to say. Kyle was having the time of his life. He'd randomly bring up baby preparations like I wonder if they make monogrammed blankets with a G for Gaylord, just to watch his family squirm. Finally, at 38 weeks, we had the gender reveal party. Everyone was there with their fake smiles, probably praying we'd announce some last minute name change. We cut into the blue cake and Kyle goes well, looks like we're having a little Bartholomew. Janet actually gasped. Emma looked like she was about to Cry. Even the neighbors who'd been invited were giving each other these worried looks. That's when I started laughing.

There are lines in life you don't cross. And when you do, you don't just break the law. You break people. For me, that line was drawn the day my sister's case went to court. She had been through hell, hurt in a way I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. She did everything right. Reported, gave statements, endured interviews, sat across from lawyers who asked her the most degrading questions you can imagine. She just wanted justice, um, recognition that what had been done to her mattered. I sat behind her in the courtroom, wearing the same suit I used for every hearing, notebook in hand. Not as a detective that day. Just a brother. Her attacker sat across the room, smug, relaxed, like he was at a casual lunch. Instead of facing charges for what he'd done. I kept staring at his hands, remembering how they'd shaken during questioning when I'd first confronted him off duty. That moment when you know someone's guilty, but they still think they can worm their way out. The trial wasn't long. Evidence lined up, witnesses were ready. The DA was confident. But when the judge walked in, I felt something I couldn't name. He wouldn't meet our eyes. Kept shuffling papers like he already hated being there. The DA made his opening statement clear and firm. Then came the defense, and it was pathetic. No alibi, no counterproof. Just character attacks and Cheap shots at my sister's credibility. But here's the thing. They didn't need a defense. Not when the judge himself was on their side. It started small. Objections overruled when they shouldn't have been. Evidence questioned that it had already been cleared for admissibility. The defense attorney practically smirking every time the judge leaned in their favor. Then the hammer blow. Halfway through testimony, my sister's voice trembling as she recounted the night everything changed, the judge actually cut her off. Said her words were too emotional to be considered reliable. He struck her testimony from the record. I felt my blood pressure spike. My fist clenched so tight, my nails dug into my palms. I wanted to shout.

Same booth in the corner, same hot chocolate with extra whipped cream. Same ritual of decompressing until my hands stopped shaking. The diner was dead quiet. Just me, the night cook, Larry, flipping eggs, one server named Beth reading a magazine, and two truckers arguing about gas prices up front. Perfect. I slid into my usual booth and ordered my drink.

Business was steady. Not booming, but enough to pay my barista as well and keep the lights on. Then out of nowhere, we started getting one star reviews. Not just any bad reviews. These were daily, always posted in the early morning, always detailed, and always personal. Coffee was lukewarm and the owner rolled her eyes when I asked for milk. The croissants are clearly frozen, not fresh baked. Owner talks too much to customers, slows down the line. None of it was true. We bake pastries at 4:00am every morning. My espresso machine hits 200 degrees like clockwork. And if I do talk to customers, it's because they're usually happy about it. I brushed off the first few, even replied politely offering to make things right. But they kept coming and they got nastier. She's rude, unprofessional, and probably microwaves the muffins.

We'd been struggling since I lost my marketing job during the pandemic. Those unemployment checks barely covered rent, let alone everything else. Kept telling Anna everything would be fine, that I'd figure it out, but honestly, I was drowning. We started turning off heat in rooms we weren't using. I'd eat a sleeve of crackers for dinner and tell Anna I wasn't hungry. The pink envelope from the bank came on a Tuesday. Final notice. 30 days to pay or lose the house. I opened it in the kitchen and just collapsed right there on the linoleum floor, sobbing like a kid. I thought Anna was at school, but she'd come home early because she forgot her textbook. She found me there with that letter in my hands, hyperventilating. Mom, what's wrong? I tried to hide it, but she grabbed the paper and read it. Her face went completely white. How much do we owe? I couldn't even look at her. 43,000 back payments fee. He's everything. The next morning, Anna wasn't in her bed. Her backpack was gone, but her school clothes were still hanging in her closet.

Determined, but scared. Like she'd made a huge decision and wasn't sure if it was right. She sat me down at our kitchen

I run a barbecue food truck, and let me tell you, street vending is like the Wild West. No matter how good your brisket is, you're always one bad inspection away from losing everything. There's this one corner downtown that's gold. Heavy foot traffic, office workers at lunch, weekend festivals, you name it. The city only allows one truck there at a time, and you have to book it through their online permit system months in advance. It's first come, first served, and if you miss your day, too bad, you can't just swap in another truck without city approval. So I book my Friday slot three months ahead. I'm there early, set up smoker going, the works. Around 11 a m, another food truck rolls up. Bright neon paint job, giant Cartoon Taco plastered on the side. It's Taco titan, run by a guy named Vince. Vince jumps out in sunglasses and a leather jacket because apparently he's auditioning for Food Network's Douchebags in the wild. I'm taking this spot today. He says like it's a done deal. I laugh, thinking he's joking. Uh, no. I've got the permit. You can check with the city. He smirks. Oh, I don't need to check. See, your truck's a Dinosaur. I'm bringing in something fresh, Instagram worthy. People want tacos? Cool. I say you can give them tacos somewhere you're actually booked. Then he drops it. I've been parking here for Years without a permit. They never check. And you know what? If you call the city, I'll just tell them you invited me. Now, I'm a reasonable guy, but this is my living. My smoker takes four hours to get to 10. Moving is not an option. So I tell him straight, if you park here without a permit, that's on you. He parks anyway, right in front of my truck, like, literally blocking half my signage. At first I'm pissed, but then I remember something. Fridays are when the city inspector does his random rounds downtown. They check permits, sanitation and fire safety. And the inspector, he's a no BS kind.

When I was 16, I lied on a job application and said I was 18 so I could clean these massive vacation houses in Aspen. My mom had died three months before from diabetes complications because we couldn't afford her insulin consistently. I was living with my aunt, who worked double shifts at a gas station just to keep our tiny apartment. These houses I cleaned were insane. Like bathrooms bigger than our entire place, with marble everything. And those fancy toilets that cost more than my aunt made in six months. I'd scrub these pristine kitchens that probably got used twice during their whole vacation. One Thursday afternoon, I was mopping the hallway in this ridiculous mansion when I heard screaming from upstairs. This 14 year old girl named Sienna was having a complete meltdown at her dad because he wouldn't buy her a second iPhone just for making TikToks. She already had the newest model, but apparently she needed a separate one for content creation. I tried to keep working, but then I heard her yell something that made my blood freeze. She screamed at her dad, if you're gonna be so annoying about money, why don't you just divorce mom and marry someone richer instead? I gripped that mop handle so tight, my knuckles went white. My mom had died on the same couch I slept on every night. We'd eaten ramen for Dinner probably 300 days that year. See, Sienna stormed out of the room and saw me standing there in the hallway. She rolled her eyes and said, uh, I hate when the help just stands around doing nothing. I wanted to say something, but I needed this job desperately, so I just kept mopping and pretended I didn't hear anything. Later, I was cleaning their kitchen when Sienna came in, talking to her friend on speaker phone. She was still ranting about the phone situation, saying stuff like, my dad is literally so cheap. I cried for, like, an hour, and he still

My daughter Rosie was six when she started limping around the house. At first I thought maybe she twisted her ankle at the playground or something. Kids are always falling and getting bruised up, right? But then she started crying about her legs hurting, especially at night. She'd wake me up at 2:00am, sobbing that her bones felt like they were on fire. I'd give her some children's Tylenol and rub her legs until she fell back asleep. This. This went on for about a week before I decided to take her to our pediatrician. Doctor Mitchell had been our family doctor for three years. He was this older guy who always seemed rushed, like he had somewhere more important to be. When I brought Rosie in, he barely looked at her for five minutes before giving his diagnosis. Well, she's carrying some extra weight, he said, looking at her chart. Kids her age should be running around more. Put her on a diet and try getting her outside more often. The leg pain is probably just from the extra strain. I stared at him. Sure, Rosie was a little chubby, but she was active. She rode her bike every day and loved playing at the park. But Doctor Mitchell was already writing something in her file and moving toward the door. But she's crying in pain every night, I said. She can barely Walk some mornings. He turned back with this annoyed look. Kids exaggerate. She's probably trying to get attention or avoid school. Just stick to the diet plan. I left feeling confused, but figured maybe he knew something I didn't. So I started packing healthier lunches for Rosie and taking her to the park every single day after school. But nothing changed. If anything, she got worse. Two weeks later, Rosie couldn't even get out of bed without help. Her little face was so pale, and she kept saying her legs felt heavy. I called Doctor Mitchell's office and managed to get another appointment. This time he seemed even more irritated when I walked in. He didn't

Now my he wants my house. When I was 16, my gaming obsessed brother Tyler convinced my parents I was taking up too much space in our cramped three bedroom apartment. He'd been complaining for months that he needed my room for his elaborate gaming setup. My parents sat me down one evening and basically said I had two weeks to find alternative living arrangements. The reasoning? I was almost 17, practically an adult, and Tyler needed space to pursue his passion in gaming. And they genuinely believed he was going to become the next big Twitch star. I was devastated, but had nowhere to go. My girlfriend Emma's parents noticed I've been spending more time at their house and eventually asked what was going on. When I explained the situation, her mom immediately said I could stay with them as long as I needed, no questions asked. Emma and I got serious fast. Living under the same roof will do that to a relationship. When we turned 19, I proposed with a ring. I'd saved six months for working overtime every weekend. Her parents were thrilled. They basically raised me for two years anyway and considered me their son. At 23, we finally had enough saved for a down payment on a small two bedroom house. Nothing fancy. We spent every weekend renovating, learning YouTube tutorials, making mistakes and fixing them. Meanwhile, Tyler was still living with my parents in his gaming paradise. He dropped out of community college after one semester, claiming his streaming career was about to take off and college was just holding him back. Three years later, he was still grinding away at maybe five viewers on a good day, sleeping until two PM, gaming until 4:00am, ordering Doordash.

My younger brother, Ethan, turned 15 last Saturday. He's had cerebral palsy since birth, and while it affects his movement, it's never slowed down his sense of humor. The kid can roast me in Mario Kart and crack one liners that make my mom choke on her coffee. This year, all he wanted for his birthday was to go to the big shopping mall downtown. The one with the massive food court, arcade, and the store that sells those custom sneakers he's obsessed with. We've been planning it for weeks, saved up to buy him a pair. Mom took the day off work. Even the weather seemed like it was cooperating. We got there around noon, Ethan in his wheelchair with a brand new Marvel hoodie, beaming like it was Christmas morning. He spotted a balloon stand near the entrance, and the vendor tied one to the armrest of his chair. It floated above him like a little red exclamation Mark. We spent the first hour just browsing, Ethan pointing out things he wanted to totally buy when he's rich, me joking that he'd better remember his big brother when that happened. Eventually, we headed to the sneaker store. Ethan had been talking about this moment for months. He rolled right up to the display, ran his hand over the shoes, and looked at me like, is this real life? That's When it happened, out of nowhere, this guy in a mall manager badge strides over. Tall, late 40s, perfect hair, gel helmet. He stops a few feet from us and says loudly, sir, you can't just roll in here and block the displays. I thought he was joking. Ethan was completely in the clear, nowhere near blocking anyone. I said, he's just looking at the shoes. The manager gives me this fake customer service smile and says, I understand, but maybe you could take him somewhere more suitable. We don't want accidents. I felt my stomach drop. Ethan smile vanished. People around us turned to look. My mom froze midstep, gripping the handles of Ethan's chair. The manager laughed, an actual chuckle, and added, besides, this is a busy store. Someone might trip over him. Trip over him? Like my brother was an obstacle? Ethan's

I was marinating ribs at 6:00am when Lexi texted me. You're uninvited. We don't want you there. No explanation, just a cold dismissal from the person who never lifted a finger for these reunions. For eight years, I've been the backbone of every family gathering. I brought the smoker, bought all the alcohol, coordinated everything. Lexi just showed up and took credit while I did the actual work. She waltzed in wearing some designer dress, pose for photos, and act like she organized everything while I was sweating over a hot grill. I stared at that text, hands covered in marinade, and typed back, fine, I'm taking my barbecue and drinks with me. An hour later, my phone explode. 15 missed calls from cousins, uncles, everyone panicking. Wait, you're not coming? What about the food? Lexi said you bailed on us. My voicemail was completely full. Text after text rolled in. Please tell me you're joking. The reunion won't be the same without your brisket. What happened? That's when I realized Lexi's fatal mistake. She never told them she uninvited me. She just announced I canceled and left them scrambling with no backup plan. Classic Lexi, creating problems and expecting everyone else to solve them. I texted my cousin Matthew. Lexi invited me, but you're welcome at my place. I've got everything we need. Matthew immediately called back. Absolutely furious. She did what? That's completely insane. I'm coming over and bringing everyone I can convince. Within minutes, half the family was choosing my backyard over Lexi's. Faster. Even the neighbors wanted in. When word spread about the impromptu cookout happening on my street, my phone kept buzzing with acceptances. Uncle Hank, on my way with the cornhole boards and my famous hot sauce. Cousin Liz bringing my potato.

I know I was there. Okay, well, does anything look off to you on your check? You guys must have raised your prices because this is ridiculous. Um, I think we did like last year, but we haven't since then. Huh? And you're sure you didn't Jack up the prices yourself just to make a little more money? No, I can't even do that. And also I don't get the money from the sales. I make $8 an hour. Okay, well, I'm just asking because this isn't adding up. Well, you looked over the Bill. Was there anything wrong with it?

I'm just as confused as you are okay, well, I'm definitely not paying for this haircut I don't trust her to fix it or to do my color so something needs to happen okay, well, I'm gonna go check the cameras so that we can correct this situation as quickly as possible and since you say you no longer trust her I can get another stylist to fix this do you want to blend it or cut to that length? There are Cameras in here? Yes. It says smile. You're on camera as soon as you walk in. You know what? I, I can hide it.

What's the saddest thing someone ever returned? One, I used to be a manager for a Disney store. We had a regular old man come in with his wife regularly. Super cute couple. I mean, matching outfits, holding hands, just cute as could be. We used to sell these huge stuffed animals, like ginormous. The couple came in about once a week and would just walk around, laugh and smile, buy things here and there. One night he came in on his own and bought one of these gigantic Mickey's we had. It was $300, I think. He was so excited. He told us all about how he was going to take her out to dinner and it would be sitting there on the bed to surprise her when they got home. Anyway, two days later, he walked back in carrying the gigantic Mickey Mouse plush to return it. He had bought it to surprise her for her 75th birthday. She passed away in her sleep the day before her birthday. He thanked us and said goodbye and that he would not be coming back because our store reminded him too much of his wife. We found out he passed away a week later, was just seven days from the day his wife passed. We found out all the details because one of our employees went to the same church they attended. Two customers regularly come in with large amounts of baby supplies, returns. They Get the wrong gender items or duplicates. An older woman came in with a cartload so I asked about the new baby. She slowly and through tears explained that her only child and grandbaby didn't make it during childbirth. 3. Not a return, but I worked in a jewelry store and the saddest sale we ever had was a labor. The guy had this ring on labor for 12 months but passed in a car accident. His parents came in and picked up the ring so his girlfriend could keep it. I don't think she had any idea he was going to propose. 4, I work at a store in a college town and one night some younger guy was returning a keg barrel only was still half full. I jokingly asked the guy if it was a trash party or something along those lines and he responded with, yeah, it was a party for one of our friends who passed the day of the party. Five, I was working at a large pet store in the tropical fish department. One busy weekend a very well dressed, rather snobby woman came in and bought six baby angel fish, each about the size of a dime plus the fins. The store I worked in was inside a huge high end shopping mall so we had a holding service where we would bag up fish, cash the customer out and float the fish in their bags in a warm tank until the Customer was finished all their shopping and was ready to leave for home. As a matter of course, I offered to hold this lady's baby angel fish. She said she was all good and left. Four or five hours later, she stormed back into the store demanding a manager and a refund. She was shaking the bag in our faces for emphasis, yelling that her gorgeous angels were all deceased. On close inspection, we discovered that the silly woman had put the poor fish in her car, presumably so she didn't need to carry them while she shopped for other things or returned to the store to pick them up. Unfortunately, because it was January and the temperature outside was extremely cold, the tiny babies had frozen. 6. A guy was returning baby formula and he was looking pretty down. I asked him how his day was and he said that he has been having a long day and that he's been having a long month too. I thought he just had a baby, so maybe he just got the wrong formula. I asked if he just had a baby and he said he used to have a baby. I told him I was sorry and he said it was okay. There were a few minutes of silence and he said he was a fun little guy, seen a lot of things, but that one broke my heart.

One. I had an Android phone which had a Google Cards feature option that could notify you like 15 minutes to home if you were out. I thought this feature was annoying and useless, so I kept the feature off. After several months of no card notifications, one night I'm at home and a card pops up saying 35 minutes to home, pinning me at a random intersection on the other side of town. Let's call it First Street in Story Avenue, I think. That's weird. I'm not even way over there. I don't even know where that is. I've never been to that area. I go to my card setting to turn it back off, but it's already turned off. That's weird. The next night the same thing happens. 35 minutes to home from 1st Saint Story. What the. Still definitely not over there. Check cards feature and the notifications are still turned off, so no idea why I'm getting a notification. A few days later, a friend and I are out running errands and he misses his intended exit, so he takes the next one. Once on the streets, I ask where are we? I've never been over here. a car to our right tries to turn left and crashes right into us. Messed up the wheel turning system, so we pulled forward to the curb to call a tow truck. We had our kids in the Car. So I called my sister to pick us all up. When my sister asks me for the location, I look up at the street signs. First Street and Story Avenue. 2 in college, I delivered pizzas to make money. I had a delivery that should have taken about 20 minutes. When I returned to the store, the manager asked me what had taken so long. I asked him what he meant, and he pointed to the computer, showing I had been gone for an hour and seven minutes. I don't remember delivering the pizza, only turning into the store when I was returning. 20 years later, I still have no idea what happened. Three. I had a dream of some kid that I had never seen before, dancing at a busy party. He was wearing a blue shirt, black pants, had Bieber hair, and there was a purple strobe light on the wall behind him. Wake up, think to myself, huh, what an odd dream, and carry on with my life. Several years later, I was at my cousin's wedding reception, chilling and hanging out with a different cousin. Music comes on and we start jumping up and down. And then I realized that I was reliving the dream. Same clothes, same hair, same purple lighting in the background. 4 A few months before my first car accident, I dreamed about it happening. Everything from the sounds to the placement and the smell was the same. The thing is, The girl driving tried to get me to find a different ride because she didn't want to do any extra driving that day. And after the crash I told her about my dream and she said she had the same one the night before and that's why she didn't want to drive. Freaky. 5 I once was woke up by a phone call from my GF. At the time she was at her friend's house, which I didn't know about until the phone call. We figured out our plans for the day. Told her that I was gonna lay around for 15 minutes to wake up a bit. I'd have a shower and head over to get her. I just laid down, started to fall asleep. Then the phone rang about 15 minutes after the last phone call. It was her calling from her friend's house again. Convo was the same word for word, so I played along. Then when it was done, she was wondering why I was laughing. I told her we just had this convo 15 minutes ago. She disagreed and I figured was pulling my leg. Later that day I checked my calls, only had one from that number. And she showed me her friend's phone. Same, only one call made. 6 I knew someone that fell asleep drunk on a three story flat roof which they rolled off of during the night. The doctors said the main reason he didn't break anything was that his Body was in such a state of relaxation from the booze induced coma he was in that he pretty much just bounced off the concrete.

One maybe 22 years ago, I had a phone interview with a baking company. I didn't care to have my peers know what I was up to, so I took the call on my cell phone in my car. The call was crystal clear and no technical issues. At one point, they had mentioned the weather and asked how it was where I was. I told him that I was sitting in my car and I could see that it was actively snowing and what not. The interviewer asked me, are you taking this call on a cell phone? I told him I was. Then he asked me if I thought that was appropriate. I asked him what he meant by that. He said he thought it was kind of rude to take a formal call on a cell phone. I told him I would be more than happy to conclude the interview if talking on a cell phone was an issue. If he was interested, I'd be happy to continue it the next day when I'd be at a desk. He again repeated how rude he thought it was that I had called from a cell phone and that there was no need to continue the interview process. I disagreed with the first point, but did agree with the second. To this day, I wonder what in the world he was talking about and where he was. Coming from too. At my wedding we marked the vegetarian items as vegetarian. This made the one vegetarian in my wedding sister in law who hates me fly into a catatonic rage because we are singling out the vegetarian food as vegetarian and not treating it as normal food. Then how the heck are they supposed to know it's vegetarian? Guess she wanted to be able to ask so then everybody knows they're vegetarian lol. Three. I once listened to my boss try to lecture the fire marshal because he was talking about something being flame retardant. Her reasoning was you should just call it fireproof because retardant was an awful word. It was one of those times where I really should have tried to stop her, but instead I just stood off to the side making a surprise Pikachu face. Four. This guy at a Halloween party I was at was dressed in a giant bacon costume. Some girl was yelling at him for being so offensive toward those who didn't eat bacon. For various reasons. Mind you, she ate pork. One of the guys who didn't eat bacon at the party asked her what the heck she was talking about, but she didn't back down. Lol. I have no idea why people feel they need to go out of their way to be inaccurately offended on behalf of other people. 5. One time someone got offended when I put on my seatbelt. She thought I was commenting on Her ability to drive. The same thing happened to me when inside a taxi, he asked, do you wear your seatbelt when you're with your dad? I said, yes. Six. My seven month old was wearing a shirt that had a rocket ship and the NASA logo. And some middle aged woman in the shop said he shouldn't be wearing that because he's clearly not an astronaut. I was dumbfounded. 7 at school, someone didn't have a calculator and asked if anyone had one they could borrow. Someone offered them a pink calculator and they refused, saying that they were offended. They try and give them something less masculine. Clearly they didn't need a calculator that badly if they're just gonna whine about the color. Eight. I'm a nurse at a children's hospital. I was wearing Mickey Mouse Halloween scrubs, which have little dancing skeletons on it. A visitor for one of my patients complained that I was wearing scary and inappropriate scrubs. Nine. People get very offended that I don't like being touched, and this happened just last week. I work at a bank in an affluent part of Atlanta, and a woman called in to let us know she was offended by the security questions for her online banking. The security questions she set up herself. 11. Wearing a mask in public.

One, at my job recently, a woman claimed I had promised her something for free when in fact all I did was offer her a significant discount. She came in demanding it for free and I refused. She said she had a recording of me saying it was free. I don't know what her endgame was, but on the off chance I had messed up what I said badly enough, I would honor it, I asked her to play me the recording. She refused because I was being difficult. She actually had the nerve to ask for my boss's number so she could complain about me not honoring a product for free valued at around $400 and thought they would actually side with her. 2. I created a binder for a hotel my company owns with forms and templates. I highlighted and wrote explanations on everything. About a month later, I go to the property to assist with some things and the GM brings out the binder and says, yeah, I just put this together as a tool for us here. I immediately tell him, no, you didn't. I made that and gave it to you. His face went white as he tried to recover saying, well, I added a few things. He didn't love the faces of my colleagues when I went back to the office and told them all three. When I worked at a fast food place, I Had someone call in during the opening shift while we were still prepping everything for the day. He tells me he was just there and that the service was terrible and his order was wrong. I asked him when exactly he came in. He said about half an hour ago. I said, oh, that's weird because we don't even open for another 45 minutes. He just hung up without a word. 4, my ex wife told my kids I didn't pay child support regularly. I was able to lay out each and every receipt for three years showing each payment made on time or early. But I wouldn't say triumphant. There are no winners in divorce. 5, my friend's favorite is from when working at Mickey D's. She was on drive drive through and a guy came through complaining about the ice cream he got earlier. That's when everyone who worked there came to the drive through window to see. Friend casually lets them know they haven't had a working ice cream machine in four months. Six, at an auto shop, angry customer ahead of me was shouting, we've been here more than two hours. The shop manager gets out a piece of paper. We printed the work order you signed less than 30 minutes ago. Seven, I was waiting at a red light behind a red BMW. I saw that its bumper was kind of messed up. The light turns green and he starts going and I slowly accelerate. Like any normal human. Then he slams on his brakes and I do the same. Don't hit him at all. He reverses into my car and turns on his hazards and pulls into the shopping complex near us. We exchange information. I am absolutely calm. Later at small claims court after rejecting his claim with my insurance, he goes, yes, your honour, this rear ending left me with 5,000 in damage including paint and 1 thousand in emotional distress as I have needed physical therapy. Judge looks at me and you say you have video of this incident. Me. Yes, I do, sir. And I hand the CD to the bailiff. The dash cam clearly shows his fraud. Judge, so is that you in the video? Him. Um, he literally got arrested and had to pay me 5,000 in damages. Get a dash cam, people. 8. I had a customer once call and say she had bought these ice cream sandwiches the week before and they were all freezer burned. She was super aggressive and was yelling. So I very politely confirmed the exact product she bought. She yelled, yes, that one. That's what I've been telling you. And I said, miss, we discontinued those six months ago. She stuttered a bit and hung up. I was 19. It was my first job and it was so satisfying.

He was always showing up in places she would be or randomly showing up at her house with no good intentions. She asked me not to get involved, so I respected her wishes for a while. he tried to break into her home one night while everyone was asleep. He got caught, made a run for it and keyed her car on the way out. Shortly after it happened, I was informed by a witness to the events. The witness expressed to me that at that time they were scared because they knew the ex boyfriend had been physically aggressive in the past and had recently tried to do it again as well. My girlfriend called me that night also but told me it was okay now and not to worry. For the next week, I staked out her house at night in case he tried again. I also found out where he lived and hung out and his routes to such places. I observed him and tracked his schedule. I waited for him to try something again and he came back to try and break in. Added security measures prevented him and after trying other ways, he left. He rode his bike down an isolated dirt path every morning as a shortcut to work. I waited and when I saw him, I blocked off his path with my vehicle. I did what? Had to be done and destroyed his bike. I told him if he even came near her again, even by accident, he wasn't going to walk away from it. An empty threat. I would have just roughed him up more at best. I also told him I recorded him trying to break into her house and damaging her property. I also read out to him in explicit detail his schedule and routines. I told him if I even thought he was sniffing around her again, I would find him. We never heard or saw from him again. We have been together for nearly 2 decades now. Very happy, successful and much so in love still. I swear I'm not a psycho, lol. I'm not possessive or an aggressive person. Everyone calls me a big teddy bear or a big softie. I grew up in a home with that kind of behavior and have zero tolerance for any of it. 2. Every time we go into a restaurant or place of business, I make sure to identify all the exit points in case something bad were to happen. Also never have my back to the doors. 3. I pretend to be asleep when he wakes up because I love how sweetly he wakes me up. 4. That I knew he was planning to propose to me, but I still acted surprised. We've been married 14 years now, but I still haven't told him. He is so proud of the idea that He managed to surprise me. 5. That I know their Reddit account. 6. That her mom called for her the moment before she passed when her mom was passing. She was in the room with her for almost 24 hours straight and left for 30 seconds and I was there in those 30 seconds. Her mother passed, but not before calling for my wife. I don't know if it will haunt her or not, but I just don't think it's something she needs to know. 7. He does not know that he was my teenage crush since I was 12 and I wrote so many beautiful poems about him. We have been married for six years and have a child together. I don't know if I will ever have the courage to tell him that I have always loved him. 8. That I have a folder of photos on my computer called Places I Have Found My Wife Shoes that is legitimately filled with thousands of pictures of my wife shoes that are neither in the closet or shoe rack. 9. That she's my partner. We rent together, go on dates, laugh together, cook together, eat together and talk about each other's day every evening. But she doesn't want a relationship right now. Before anyone says anything, I know how it sounds and I'm slowly making my way out of the situation. 10. Out of grocery shop efficiently. I can't stand going into the grocery store with her. She makes A list and then follows the list order through the store back and forth. She visits the same aisle three to four times.

One, when he was little, my younger son wouldn't try and wake you up if he needed something. He'd do that creepy thing kids do where they just stand there looking at you until you wake up. Well, I wake up at about 1:00am in a dark bedroom and see the black silhouette of a young kid standing right next to the bed. Golly, that's scary. Then he asked, hey, dad, Wanna play Rock Band 2? Waking up to my husband yelling, get out of my house. A man broke into my house and crawled in bed with me. Turns out he was in the house for a couple of hours. According to my door camera, my husband was asleep on the couch, came to bed and found the guy on the bed beside me asleep. Also, I accidentally left my door unlocked when I lived in this studio apartment in Philly. I woke up and it felt like someone was watching me. You know that feeling. Then I heard a shuffling noise and turn the lights on. There was a guy in a hoodie standing at the foot of my bed. I screamed. It was a young drunk dude that I literally had to push out. He seemed confused, but I'll never know what his intent was. I've never left my door unlocked since 3. Once I woke up to go to the bathroom, got up, smack something, slap me in The face. Turns out it was my entire right arm. Completely numb. Nearly scared the piss out of me and concerned me greatly afterwards. Has not happened since. 4. Back when I lived alone in an apartment, I used to wake up to just about anything. Never woke up more terrified than the night when I woke up to the sound of my toilet flushing. To this day, I can only assume that a ghost just couldn't hold it anymore. Five, I woke up and my dad's alarm clock was going off through the wall. He was a really light sleeper and he always turned it off immediately. It had been going off for several minutes and I think I knew before I got to his room that he was no longer with me. It was just so incredibly out of character for that alarm to be going off like that. He went in his sleep with a blanket still completely undisturbed. And I think I felt some small comfort at that, even though I was just a kid. 6, I once woke up to an earthquake at 4:00am. I lived in a house over the ocean on stilts, so my house was rocking like crazy. It was my first earthquake. And for some reason my brain first thought that someone was robbing me. I grabbed a machete and ran outside shirtless in my underwear. Neighbors next to me looked at me alarmed and started laughing. 7, my partner waking. Me up during a camping trip. He woke me to gather all our gear and our dogs into our truck ASAP. Lightning we had spotted six hours earlier in the day had sparked a wildfire. We got out as ash and sparks were falling around us. When we reached the top of the ridge surrounding our camp, we got out to look and watch the fire eat our entire campsite. We're so glad we called in the strike when we saw it. We met fire crews on our way out. The fire burned for like a week. One of the fires in Oregon in 2020, the Lakeview Paisley Fire 8, a bed bug infestation. I had had them for weeks and had no idea what they were. I would see one or two here or there and I'd just squash them, wonder what they were and move on. One morning, I woke up early and found quite a few of them on my bed. I started looking more closely and realised that the creases of the mattress were infested with them. Then I started to do some research, Learned that I had bed bugs, felt my soul leave my body, then began the process of getting rid of them. They're a psychological horror experience I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy. Five years after the fact, and I still get paranoia attacks at a random speck in the sheets or mysterious red marks in the morning.

One. I once needed a pen. Figured this was a reasonable ask, went to the supply closet on my floor, which was locked. Asked the floors admin, and she told me to go to the main supply room in the basement. I went to the basement and explained my situation of needing a pen. They told me all requests for supplies must be approved by my department head. The problem is, being new, I'd never met my department head. She also worked in San Francisco. I worked in Milwaukee, so I needed to send an email both introducing myself and asking her if I had permission to get a pen from the supply closet. 2. All the extra toilet paper in the building has to stay in a single closet, where it can be overseen by the toilet paper queen. I heard her shrieking the other day when she discovered someone had hoarded one spare roll of toilet paper upstairs so the people who work upstairs wouldn't have to walk down multiple flights of stairs when the toilet paper ran out. It's the cheapest one ply toilet paper available on the giant rolls that only fit in the special dispensers. I can't imagine anyone wanting to steal it. Three. A rule that said if you have time to lean, you have time to clean. Which fairly obviously meant if there was no work, then you should be cleaning things. It Was at an aircraft servicing station that was fairly small, but we needed a crew of at least three people for larger planes. The problem was that sometimes there were just no planes, so there was no work. We would clean for a couple of hours and then just run out of stuff to clean. But according to management, that was no good. We had to be busy. It got to be that we would fight over work when it came in, because everyone was so bored. And finding pretend busy work was much harder than just working. I remember getting the crew together to pick up pebbles off the taxiway for a couple hours. There's an old joke in aviation. Go sweep the taxiway. So we actually did it. Four. I drive LA. The company handbook says you're never allowed to back up, ever. You absolutely cannot do the job without reversing. It's impossible. It's in there because of liability in our insurance policy. This way, it can always be the valet's fault if an accident occurs. Ever. The rule only exists to cover the company's rear. Five. When I was in the military, I saw a buddy of mine sitting outside crying. I went and consoled him as best as I could. Apparently, he was just unhappy. After he was feeling a bit better, I went to go and find someone to tell them what was happening. They knew. In fact, he had been crying so much lately, That they had instituted a no crying at your desk policy, which is why he was outside. 6. Empty inbox my boss was an inbox enforcer. Like if you had old emails in there he would flip and make you respond to them or delete them. Apparently you shouldn't have anything left at the end of the day. Deal with them or delete them. Jokes on him though, I just made a subfolder marked personal and everything went in there. 7. My workplace doesn't let you use the word problems. Instead we have to say challenges if something is wrong, as a problem is a negative word and challenges promotes the fact that there is room to fix said problem. 8. I used to work at a place in which my boss implemented a no more than two glasses a day water policy. I ignored this rule and complained directly to our CEO and the matter ended later that day. Nine. Can't have my hands in my pockets. 10. Business casual dress code. Even when I work at home they video call me to check. 11. No one can go to lunch between 12 and 2.

What was the rest of the date like? One, first date from a dating app. We went for beverages at a hotel spot restaurant. When we were ordering the beverages, she said to the bartender, you can serve the restaurant menu here, right? I'll have the end. Proceeded to name the expensive dish she already knew by name. That was the there will be no second date red flag. The plan wasn't dinner, was a drink. Originally she had suggested an expensive restaurant, but I'd said let's just have a drink the first time, clearly just a foodie call. The I'm leaving now red flag was that she got on the phone and texted for a while, then said, my friends are coming to meet us. Let's order some more appetizers and a bottle. That was when I said the plan was some beverages to get to know each other, not be the wallet for your friends night out. I'll cover these beverages, have fun with your friends and left to pay my part of the Bill. Two, we matched on a dating app and he kept messaging me persistently, but he seemed like a nice guy. So he picked me up and took me to a decent sushi place. The actual dinner part went fine. Aside from him being very nervous and visibly sweating as he drove me home, he continually professed his love for me. By the time We got to my building. I was ready to book it as fast as possible into the entrance door which would lock behind me and he would be unable to enter without a key. Balked immediately. 3. An immediate red flag was that she told me she had no money and then she ordered the most expensive beverage on the list halfway through the date. She said she came from her ex boyfriend's house, but not to worry, they were no longer together. I finished my drink and excused myself to the bathroom. I tracked down our waitress and paid for our beverages. When I returned to the table, I told her I didn't think this was going to work out and left. Four, guy admitted to being technically homeless and crashing in a studio with two other guys. Told me he'd had 13 injuries that may have LED to memory loss. He didn't believe in key rings so he kept his keys on a rope, farted on a cat. I could go on. So much happened and all of it was unhinged. He got up to go to the bathroom and in a moment of inspiration and panic, I suddenly gained self awareness and realized I could leave. I threw money down on the bar top, made sympathetic eye contact with the bartender who had been watching the train wreck go down and then sprinted out of the restaurant. 5, she wanted to order lobster. I said, waiter, separate Bills, please. She glared at me, calling me broke while making the face. I ate my cheeseburger and fries and left her alone. Talk about spoiled. 6. We were having a very nice time, good chat, good company, etcetera. I looked over my shoulder to see the decor of the place we were in and she said, excuse me, I'm over here. She didn't like me not making eye contact all the time. If I looked away, she was insulted. The date ended and I drove away. 7, blind date, friend of a friend. He did not stop talking the entire time, didn't ask me one question. I just sat there mentally playing my favorite songs in my head until the Bill came. Because I'm a nice person and thought he might be nervous, I gave him another chance. The same thing happened over the phone. I fell asleep for 15 minutes and when I woke up, he was still talking. We did not meet up again. 8. She had never seen Star Wars. I'm not a fan. I don't even really like Star Wars. She brought up in conversation, complaining that her brother had become obsessed with the Star War. And that was it the whole rest of the date. Inside my head I asked myself, but how could she not know the name? Surely she's heard other people say it. Her brother has a lot of merch. She's read it many times. She doesn't have to care about It, but like, how is it even possible?

The type of guy she claims she likes isn't what she's actually attracted to. She keeps saying how much she loves shy, introverted, sensitive guys, but when she finds one and dates him, suddenly he's not outgoing enough, doesn't speak his mind enough, and is too shy. I kind of think she has this I can fix him syndrome and doesn't really acknowledge it. Like she's attracted to the idea of a typical shy guy, but thinks once they're in a relationship they'll suddenly be more open and turn into the guy she actually wants. That's not how it works. 2. I can smell them. Everyone can smell them. I also had a coworker who started smelling like a poorly cleaned public restroom. Didn't smell like poop, but it was a terrible, almost chemical smell. I had a meeting with him. I had to make an excuse to leave the conference room because I felt like I was going to vomit. His manager finally took him aside and was like dude, what the crap is going on? Turns out he had started something that caused it and claimed he couldn't smell it. I have my doubts about this. He took a week off and came back smelling fine. Apparently his doctor swapped out his prescriptions and that was it. So maybe a similar situation. 3. I always wondered why she couldn't get A date because she is gorgeous. Until I saw her flirting with someone first night they met, flirted, swap numbers, then immediately clingy talking in a baby voice to him and making baby noises. He made a completely innocent comment which she found offensive and threatened him. Not shocking at all when he never called. Four really is not as nice of a person as he thinks he is. Five he keeps hanging on to the past and spending all his time hanging out with ex girlfriends who are unavailable or women who like him, but he doesn't romantically like. 6 the people they like aren't real. They are idealized, cartoonish caricatures. Now my friend himself has a lot to offer emo, but he is looking for a person that doesn't exist. Hard to find something that's not there. Seven she is so lovely, so kind, so generous, and so beautiful, but her crippling lack of self esteem is so huge it's visible from space. Basically, when she's nervous that she talks at 100 miles an hour in several directions at once. It's like being handed eight happy Labrador puppies to try and hold in your arms. I so badly want her to be happy and feel fulfilled, but even I find it tiring sometimes. 8 her standards are excessively too high. She brings nothing to a relationship. She's a walking contradiction. All of which is why she is single. I think it's great to have standards, but hers is Just a checklist of wants. 9 for my husband's friend, it's the selfish arrogance. I want what I want. And the subtext was that he never cared about what his girlfriend wanted. He would only go places he wanted to go, which never included her friends or family. He wanted to spend all his money on collectibles related to SCI fi movies, DVDs, figurines, etc. Engagement rings were a waste of money investing or buying a house. Ditto. No compromises were possible, he said no and no discussions were entertained. His opinion on every topic was the correct one and he was not interested in your opinion or listening to extra facts he did not know that might change his mind. 10 summarizing the two types of my single friends super successful, smart, funny, and good looking. They also tend to go for folks who leave them on read for days. Their self esteem is their own worst enemy. Other friends don't know how to commit to anything, including a job. It almost feels like an it'll happen when it happens type of ideology, and so they don't even try to make things happen.

One, when I was 14, a friend hosted a birthday party at his house with all the parents invited, needed to use the restroom, but the main one was occupied. So my friend told me I could use the one in his mom's bedroom. As I walked up to the door, I could hear somebody in there. So I decided to wait until whoever was in there was finished. A good 10 minutes later, my friend's mom, who was hosting the party and another good friend's stepfather walked out and saw me standing there all confused. They asked what I was doing there and I just said I was waiting to use the bathroom. Surprisingly, they played it cool and just said I can use it now and walked off. 2, I found my dad's will. I was on his computer while he was at work and ended up finding a strangely titled word document. First, it didn't seem like a big deal. It contained a note to each of his kids. It wasn't until I got to the last one, my youngest brother, then I realized it wasn't just a will. The start of that line read something along the lines of, if anything is going to make me change my mind, now it's writing. This part, I realized I had found my dad's note for his last moments. I was about 14 or 15 at the Time and I had no idea how to go about talking to him about it. I decided to just keep it to myself. He started buying us gifts and stuff and I would get really scared. 3. As a middle schooler, I picked up a book at the library, flipped through the pages and found an application for a replacement birth certificate for some old man. It had every detail about his personal identification on it. So naturally I took it home thinking I'll just hold on to this in case I ever need to assume a fake identity by pretending to be an 80 year old man and flee the country. My mom found it and had to explain to me that no, we don't steal people's identities. 4. I was about 8 or 9 and my parents were going to be out of town so they had me and my siblings stay with a family from our church. Once we got to the house, which was really nice by the way, they had one rule. You can play wherever you want but the basement is off limits. Being the little rascal that I was, snuck down there the first chance I got and was supremely disappointed to only find rows and rows of plants growing under lights. Looking back, I now know what it was. 5 when I started a new job, someone had left a bunch of HR files on the computer I was given. I opened One up, not sure what it was and I got to see every employee's salary in the company, even the CEO. The next day it was gone. My boss realized his mistake and logged into my system and deleted the files. It was a memorable experience. 6. I worked at a fancy health food restaurant years ago. One day I was early and saw the owner mixing his homemade cold pressed garlic aioli. It was Cisco mayonnaise and a big jar of minced garlic. 7. I was bartending and it was slow. I was putting away glasses by the only two people sitting at the bar. They seemed a new couple, very touchy, etcetera. At some point I noticed that she was wearing a wedding ring and he was not. Right. As the music silenced between songs, he turned to her and said, you know, they're going to ask you where you were when he passed. NOPED out of there real quick. Hey, my parents toy collection. That was way more reality than my 10 year old mind was prepared to handle. 9. My mother's autopsy report. My mom passed in a car accident because she pulled me out of the way of a speeding car. It, it was so unreal that I didn't even cry until years later. Several years later, I was probably 16 or 17 and looking into my dad's archive for some personal documentation about myself to submit a college application. Out of nowhere I opened This folder and found pictures of my mother lying on an operation table.

I went on a breakfast date with a man one time. He spread ketchup across his entire plate and then chopped all the food into one big pile. Pancakes were involved. At that moment, I knew I could never see him again. Honestly, if they breathe or eat or swallow too loud, I can't handle it. It's petty, I know, but I can't do the rest of my life listening to someone breathe like a 70 year old man asleep on a chair or chew and swallow like a cow. 2, someone that takes forever to get ready to go literally anywhere. I once dated a girl and it literally took her 40 minutes to get ready to walk the dog for 15 minutes with me. Mind you, this was not a phobia. And for the record, she didn't wear any makeup nor did she wear anything special that might explain the sloth pace. Just basically talking my ears off and spending an eternity tying her shoelaces. It even left me with a small existential crisis, wondering if I would even be cut out for children. But choosing a life like this with an adult, I have way too little patience for that. Sorry. 3. This girl was beautiful, driven, intelligent. We got along well. She was perfect except that she would snap her fingers whenever someone would say something she liked. Every conversation peppered with snaps, she'd do it instead. Of applauding at concerts, too. Eventually I realized that this couldn't be my life. 4, the guy I married goes by his first and middle initials. Think J, C, L, J. And when I found out his actual first name about six months into dating him, it legitimately made me upset because it was such an old fashioned name. It didn't make me end, but I sure thought about it. To this day, 10+ years together, I avoid saying his proper name like the plague. I feel super petty about my feelings, but all these years later, I still really, really dislike it. I'm just used to it. Five, I once broke up with a girl because her teeth were small and the gaps between all her teeth really freaked me out. 6, I went on a first date with a guy at a coffee shop. I got there before him and was sitting at a table waiting. He walked up and instead of approaching and saying, excuse me, are you so and so, he very loudly yelled my name and everyone around turned and looked at him while I homered back into the bushes. It was over then and there. I think he thought he was being manly and dominant or something, but I'm a private and introverted person and that made my skin crawl. Seven, I swear to you, the day we got married, my wife started swallowing loudly like she knew it was a thing she did. She intentionally hit it and then stopped trying to hide it five seconds after our vows. 8, was married to someone. Then when that ended, I dated someone who had the same name. Years later, I was flirting with someone and when I Learned they had the same name, I just turned and walked away. 9. I won't date them if they don't use their turn signals. If you can't communicate on the road, you can't communicate in a relationship. 10. I dated a really cute lady in my early 20s. Pretty much my type, super sweet, but she did this weird exhale, scoff thing consistently in conversation when she didn't like something. And it became so noticeable I was going to lose my mind. I finally was just like, yeah, this isn't going to work. Eleven. They drag their feet when they're walking. 12. This was years ago, but I would swipe left on any dude holding an iPhone without a case on it cause I didn't need that kind of stress in my life. 13, allergies. I love animals and I'm not going to date a man who might pass away if I come around him after eating a peanut or shrimp.

One first time I took a hot shower in our new home, the steam covered the mirror only to reveal the phrase, hello, I see you in large finger drawn writing. It freaked me out for a second but made me laugh soon after that. It was such an inconspicuous yet obvious thing to leave for the new homeowner. Me. Two, wasn't a purchase, but I was showing a house to a couple and we couldn't believe the reported square footage. It looked like a nice 1,700 square foot house in a semi rural community, but the square footage on the listing said about 4,500. I was sure it was a typo. Turns out most of it was in the basement. Think Buffalo Bills basement. That just goes on and on with random rooms. The place was vacant. The lighting wasn't great. We got to a dead end room down there and turned on the lights and there was this porcelain doll just chilling in the middle of the room. Only thing left in the house. Husband yells, screw this, and we all run out. We ruled out that whole neighborhood as an option for obvious reasons. 3, $1,200 in cash above the door on the inside of the closet. I found it while painting. 4, we bought a house being foreclosed on. We gave him an extra month after closing in. 2000 to help with his move. Still had to have the sheriff come to remove him. Anywho, I was doing some clean up and remodeling before we moved in. The whole house was carpeted. When I started ripping it out, there was a giant blood stain that started in a downstairs spare bedroom and then trailed up to the master bath where there was another stain. His wife had left him. So I had to call the realtor to find out if anyone knew where she was. Turns out he had taken out a deer in the yard and gutted it in the house. What a hassle. Had to rip up and install new sub floors. My vegan ex wife was not thrilled. 5. The property my wife and I moved to three years ago had a bucket full of wrapped Dinosaur bones. Took them to our local museum where they confirm they are roughly 68 million years old. Hadrosaur. Pretty cool. 6. We bought the house from the CEO of the company which we franchise from. It was her childhood home where her mother lived until the day she passed. In true rich person fashion, they didn't care to clean out the house before selling it. They just told us we can do whatever we want with the old lady stuff that was there. We found a hidden box of spicy letters from the old lady to her secret partner spanning many years. That was fun to give to the CEO 7, my uncle was renovating the house that he bought for his chiropractic practice. And when he knocked down a wall to enlarge a room, a few dozen pill bottles fell to the floor. They were each filled with about 25 US silver dollars, which at the time were worth more like $6 in silver each. So it was about $5,000 in vintage coins. 8, that they wired a room by connecting the outlet with an extension cord inside the wall. 9, a diary of an American soldier in World War 2 South Pacific Theater found it above a door when remodeling 20+ years ago. My wife and I tried everything we could think of to find a descendant, but to no avail. Ten, a basement room that was fully decked out as a dungeon. Fake stone walls, a stocks like where you lock your head and hands in Old England. Candle scones on the walls, a metal barred cage in the corner from floor to ceiling. Oh, and the closet had a load of toys, some normal, some not so normal. 11, an entire tribe of raccoons living in the attic.

My old apartment complex had a soda vending machine at the pool that was broken. If you put in 50 cents and press the button, nothing happened. If you put in another 50 cents and press the button, nothing happened. But if you put 50 cents in a third time and press the button, you'd get three sodas. I could see the vending machine from my couch, so I would watch for someone to try and then try again and then give up without trying a third time. And then I'd head over and get three sodas for 50 cents. Two. Not me, but my roommate. In college, whenever you paid for anything on the university's website, you'd earn college bucks, each year's tuition, pay for something small like a beer, koozie, fold up lawn chair, or if you somehow spent an absurd amount, an official school branded kayak. Well, my buddy found out that the points were added to your account before payment went through on the website. So he just refreshed the page over and over and got millions of points. I only found out about his scheme when I came home to an entire living room filled with boxes from our school. There were shirts, coolers, chairs, cups and, of course, the kayak. We opened all of it like idiots and had a giant laugh at the school's expense. All of the guys living in that house. Were having a great time until we opened the smallest box which had 1,100 dollar visa gift cards. Then we got scared. A bunch of school branded crap from a warehouse was probably unusual, but not something that would bother the person loading all that up for delivery. The gift cards though, that was where he got caught. The gift card issuer called the school to verify such a large amount before activating the cards and that raised a lot of red flags in the accounting department. They traced it all back to my roommate and came and took everything back. They left the opened items in the worthless gift cards and suspended him during his final semester of college. He had to write an apology letter and do community service for the school for that whole semester in return for not pressing charges for fraud. It makes for a great story though. We had a ton of beer, koozies and gift cards that we threw at each other like Ninja Stars 3. When in high school, there was a company that offered money to run an advertising window at the top of your screen would monitor mouse movement to track whether you were at your computer and pay a small amount per hour. A buddy and I downloaded it and a mouse moving software and it would run both 24 7 except when we were on the computer. Made a few hundred dollars off of it before the company Closed down 4 Coca Cola did a campaign where you register a code from the bottle cap and earn prizes I worked at a store with a bottle deposit and earn myself a sweet MP three player with room for five songs or something. It was pretty sweet at the time. 5 had a college professor who insisted on doing all tests and quizzes online. If you looked at the page through view page source all of the answers for each multiple answer question had a marker on which one was correct. 6 free sandwiches from CFA based on location I used GPS spoofer and got tons of free sandwiches a week on multiple accounts. I think I got about $5,000 worth of sandwiches and nuggets before they banned me. 7 I received thousands of dollars of stock certificates in the mail. Some intern messed up so badly that my broker said to hold on to it I I held the stock for years before selling it at a profit. 8 I Learned before my USAF basic training to say that I played an instrument whenever they asked the group on the first day I raised my hand and lied and said the symbols so most days I got to angrily smash symbols together in the air conditioning band trailer.

One. The grandma who used coconut oil on her granddaughter who was extremely allergic and passed from it. As someone who works with toddlers, that story is a nightmare. Grandma nonchalantly caused the passing of her granddaughter. Not because she didn't know about the allergy, because she just didn't think it was a big deal. And in no time flat, a toddler is gone and two parents and two surviving siblings are forever traumatized. And grandma can't figure out why her daughter won't see her two. It wasn't as memorable or as big as most Reddit comments, but one has stuck with me. I forgot what the question was, but this guy commented that he was asked to bring like two gallons of milk to his girlfriend's family dinner. He thought, oh, they must really like milk. When he arrived, each family member had their own gallon of milk, and when dinner was served they all just started guzzling their own milk like animals. I need to try finding that. It was hilarious. 3 the one where the guy had an imaginary girlfriend, later wife, who was a giant cockroach, and his coworkers eventually found out that he had a whole fantasy life with his life size cockroach girlfriend slash wife. Four people seem to regularly post what Reddit post can't you get over? And I always drop in to say the pregnant woman whose husband and father In law decided she'd pass in labor and we're doing all the planning for that to happen. She never updated and I always wonder and worry a little. Wish I'd save the post. 5 the guy who was looking for legal advice because his landlord was sneaking in and leaving him notes while he was sleeping and someone in the comment section saved his life by realizing he was actually suffering carbon monoxide poisoning. Six the lady on ADA who unplugged her fridge to deep clean it while her husband had a box in there who told her to not open the box. I frequently wonder what was in the box. 7 the dude that bought a house with his GF and wasn't allowed upstairs. I want an update to this more than any unsolved mystery. 8 the guy who caught his wife cheating thanks to his Dyson fan epic. 9 the guy who Rick rolled Rick Astley.

My first few months as a 9 1 1 operator were scary, but nothing could have prepared me for when I got a call late at night from a young girl. I could barely understand what she was saying through her sobbing, but she told me she had just swallowed an entire bottle of pills and just wanted someone to talk to before they did anything. I started asking her why she would do that and asked for her address. She thought I already had it. But after a few minutes, she finally told me where she lived. She said she was severely depressed and just wanted everything to end. I asked her why, just trying to keep her on the phone and she said she couldn't take the hate she was getting anymore. I knew I only had literal minutes to do something and tried talking her into throwing up. She told me no. So I asked her what kind of hate she was getting. Apparently, she just wanted people to like her and wanted to help people. She was getting a lot of hate comments on TikTok and even people in real life. Then it all clicked. I knew I recognized her voice and I actually knew who she was. After a few minutes, I asked her if she was who I thought and she was really surprised. I started to tell her how one of her Videos actually changed my life and got me out of a toxic relationship. She knew I wasn't lying because I told her all about it. I asked her one more time and she finally agreed to try and make herself throw up. She was unconscious when the paramedics got there, but because of that, she was still alive. She now has millions of followers and I'm glad to see her much happier today.

When my son was in the third grade, he was a bully. We tried everything, but he kept constantly getting in trouble and sent to the office. He was known throughout the school for tying balloons to the class rabbit and almost letting it float away. I was leaving work to go get him and as my phone rang, I already knew who it was. I had a special ringtone for his teacher because she called me so much just so I could prepare to hear what he did. She was crying when I answered and I knew it was bad. I told her I was on the way, but instead of getting upset, she started to thank me. I was really confused and she started to talk about what a sweet boy I raised. Literally nobody had ever told me that before for. And I asked what happened. Apparently another kid who didn't have a lot of friends was in his class and his mom had handed out birthday invitations to everyone the day before. Right before the bell went off, he stood up in front of everyone and asked who was coming to his party. The entire class was now silent and he just stood there looking around for someone to tell him they were going. Nobody was saying anything. And she said she could see the kids heart literally breaking in Real time. Then, as he went to sit back down in shame, my son stood up and said, I'm gonna come. I'll be there. His face lit up, and one by one, all the other boys in the class followed his lead and also started telling him they'd come, too. He was trying not to cry when we showed up that weekend.

What did you do in 9th grade? I got the teacher everybody wanted for biology. Except one morning our entire class could hear her outside the room getting chewed out by our assistant principal for being late on grading. We also knew she had lost her sister the week before, so she was having a really rough time. A few minutes into teaching, she started explaining something about our final exam and the guys next to me were passing notes. They usually did it every time she turned around, but this time she saw them. She usually wouldn't have cared, but she thought it was something about her. So she walked over and asked to see it. Kid shook his head without saying anything. So she basically reached into his pocket to grab the note. She started reading it in front of the class and said, I left it in the garbage bin in room W12. It's all there with the. And stopped herself before reading the rest out loud. She looked down at the boy, clearly having read something bad and didn't know what to say. Her face was pale and not knowing what to do. She grabbed them both and literally yanked them out of the room. We all sat there confused for a half hour wondering what that note said. There were police at our school and they asked our whole route to come to the office. They questioned everybody about It, but nobody knew anything. And by the time they let us go, they had sent everybody home. We later found out that the note said there was a key to the office in that garbage bin along with a loaded gun. Both of them denied writing it and said they didn't know who it was for. So they decided to fire our teacher for creating a school wide panic and expelled our entire row.

A few students decided to play a senior prank on the principal by writing on his car. And it made him so mad he decided to cancel the entire prom for the year. Everyone was pissed. So at the homecoming game the week after, we were chanting to bring it back. Eventually at the end, some kid with a banana suit jumped over the bleachers and ran across the field. Everyone screamed as he was being chased by coaches and teachers, and even the players loved it. Eventually, they tackled him hard and he ended up breaking his arm and had to go to the hospital. They had to cancel the game and the staff were so mad they suspended him for the rest of the year. He was probably gonna get expelled, but the students loved him so much, they decided they were gonna do something about it. That day, free Banana Man was born and everyone started chanting it in the halls. Few guys sold t shirts that said it and they wrote it all over the walls. At our school, there were bananas everywhere. And this made our principal so mad, he banned the phrase entirely. However, he didn't just stop there. He decided to go as far as to ban the actual fruit itself and even the entire color yellow. You literally weren't allowed to wear yellow to school. And if you were caught eating A banana, you were sent home for the day. This rule made the entire student body so furious they pretty much declared a war on the administration. Hundreds of students were getting sent home because they decided to bring bananas and wear yellow. And when they tell them to take their yellow shirts off, they'd walk around shirtless to class. I even saw a guy come to school in all yellow, and when they made him take it off, he tried to go to class only in his underwear, which was also yellow. It got so crazy that one kid who literally needed to eat bananas for the potassium couldn't for the week and ended up passing out in the middle of class. He went to the hospital and his parents threatened to sue the school. The very next day, we watched our principal walk out for the last time and the banana guy returned wearing his costume.

I taught 5th grade for a few years and had to stay up really late one night to grade some essays. I was exhausted, but I remember reading one of them and couldn't believe what I saw. I told my class to write about a funny story, and this girl, Kelly, wrote about how her mom had almost killed her. She said her mom woke her and her brothers up one morning yelling at them because someone ate a candy from her room. All of them denied it, so they had to stand in a corner until one of them admitted they had eaten it. After an hour, nobody said anything. So their mom stepped it up. She was determined to find who did it, so she made all of them drink an entire cup of salt water until they vomited. She said her throat hurt so much she started crying. I couldn't believe I was reading this and thought she had to have been making it up. I knew her mom and she seemed so nice. She said whoever ate it would have to sleep outside that night. And when she was about to get another glass of salt water, her brother stepped up. He said he took it and her mom was furious. She was literally moving his bed outside. But as she did, their dad came home and had no idea what was going on when He found out it was because of the candy. He told them he was the one who ate it. This was supposed to be her funny story. This girl was 9 and there was no way she was making this up. I couldn't just go to bed. So I called and woke our student advisor up and read her essay word for word over the phone. She, too, didn't believe it was real. So we asked her about it the next day at school. Apparently she just thought it was a funny story and didn't think her mom was being too mean. We had to report. But as soon as someone went out to talk to her parents, she took her daughter out of the school. I hope she's doing okay. Update. I just saw her on the news. She was arrested and put in jail last night.

My 13 year old son, Alex asked if he could download a chess app on his tablet. I was shocked. All his friends were begging for Fortnite or some zombie game, and here's my kid wanting to play chess. I said yes immediately. See, I'm pretty strict about screen time. No games, no social media. Homework first. Alex has always been quiet, kind of awkward around other kids. Chess seemed perfect for building his brain. He got obsessed fast. Every day after school, straight to his room with that tablet. I'd hear him muttering moves under his breath. Night to E4, check. When I asked how it was going, he'd light up, talking about strategy and logic patterns. Months in, I noticed something weird. He'd quickly close the tablet whenever I walked in. Said he was just thinking through positions. Then one night, I heard him talking. Not muttering chess moves, actually talking to someone. I knocked. Who are you talking to? Just practicing out loud, dad. Helps me think. My gut said something was wrong. Next day, I checked his tablet while he was at school. The chess app was deleted. Completely gone. When I asked him about it, he said he took a break and was doing puzzles in his head now. That's when I installed tracking software. Took me three days to figure out how, but I did it. What I found made my blood boil. He'd Been using a fake chess app that was actually a cover for some underground gambling site. He was playing speed chess for money against adults online. Real money. His username was Chess Master J, and he had over $400 in his account. I watched one of his matches through the tracker. My quiet, awkward kid was trash talking grown men like some kind of gaming streamer. You call that a defense? My little sister plays better than you. Then he destroyed them in under five minutes with moves I couldn't even follow. But here's the crazy part. I kept watching, and this wasn't some gambling addiction. The kid was genuinely incredible. He was beating adults who'd been playing for decades. One guy even accused him of cheating and demanded a video call. Alex turned on his camera, solved three chess puzzles in 30 seconds, then checkmated the guy in seven moves while explaining every decision. I dug deeper into his account. Turns out he'd been banned from our school's chess team six months ago for embarrassing another school's coach during a live tournament. Coach had called Alex a know it nothing kid. So Alex responded by beating him in front of 200 people while explaining each mistake the coach made. The school said it was unsportsmanlike conduct. Alex never told me. Just said he quit the team because it was boring. So for months, he'd been rebuilding his reputation online, earning money, and getting revenge on everyone who'd written him Off the fake chess app. Wasn't about being lazy. It was about hiding how good he actually was. That night at dinner, I put a chess board between us. Wanna play a quick game? His face went white. Dad, I don't really. One game. Humor your old man.

A few students decided to play a senior prank on the principal by writing on his car. And it made him so mad he decided to cancel the entire prom for the year. Everyone was pissed. So at the homecoming game the week after, we were chanting to bring it back. Eventually at the end, some kid with a banana suit jumped over the bleachers and ran across the field. Everyone screamed as he was being chased by coaches and teachers, and even the players loved it. Eventually, they tackled him hard and he ended up breaking his arm and had to go to the hospital. They had to cancel the game and the staff were so mad they suspended him for the rest of the year. He was probably gonna get expelled, but the students loved him so much, they decided they were gonna do something about it. That day, free Banana Man was born and everyone started chanting it in the halls. Few guys sold t shirts that said it and they wrote it all over the walls. At our school, there were bananas everywhere. And this made our principal so mad, he banned the phrase entirely. However, he didn't just stop there. He decided to go as far as to ban the actual fruit itself and even the entire color yellow. You literally weren't allowed to wear yellow to school. And if you were caught eating A banana, you were sent home for the day. This rule made the entire student body so furious they pretty much declared a war on the administration. Hundreds of students were getting sent home because they decided to bring bananas and wear yellow. And when they tell them to take their yellow shirts off, they'd walk around shirtless to class. I even saw a guy come to school in all yellow, and when they made him take it off, he tried to go to class only in his underwear, which was also yellow. It got so crazy that one kid who literally needed to eat bananas for the potassium couldn't for the week and ended up passing out in the middle of class. He went to the hospital and his parents threatened to sue the school. The very next day, we watched our principal walk out for the last time and the banana guy returned wearing his costume.

I got the teacher everybody wanted for biology. Except one morning, our entire class could hear her outside the room getting chewed out by our assistant principal for being late on grading. We also knew she had lost her sister the week before, so she was having a really rough time. A few minutes into teaching, she started explaining something about our final exam, and the guys next to me were passing notes. They usually did it every time she turned around, but this time she saw them. She usually wouldn't have cared, but she thought it was something about her, so she walked over and asked to see it. Kid shook his head without saying anything, so she basically reached into his pocket to grab the note. She started reading it in front of the class and said, I left it in the garbage bin in room W12. It's all there with the. And stopped herself before reading the rest out loud. She looked down at the boy, clearly having read something bad and didn't know what to say. Her face was pale, and not knowing what to do, she grabbed them both and literally yanked them out of the room. We all sat there confused for a half hour, wondering what that note said. There were police at our school, and they asked our whole row to come to the office. They questioned everybody about It. But nobody knew anything and by the time they let us go they had sent everybody home. We later found out that the note said there was a key to the office in that garbage bin along with a loaded gun. Both of them denied writing it and said they didn't know who it was for. So they decided to fire our teacher for creating a school wide panic and expelled our entire row.

When I was 17, my mom forced me to start babysitting, but I had no idea who I was doing it for. When I met this woman, I couldn't believe how overprotective she was. She had cameras in every room of the house and asked me to call her every half hour just to make sure her daughter was okay. She told me I wasn't allowed to do anything except watch her. And when she finally left, I basically just sat there for three hours doing nothing until she came home. She came back and basically ran into the room to make sure the girl was okay and I assured her everything was fine. I had long hair at the time and had put it up at this point. And should probably now mention I have severe hearing loss. I have to wear hearing aids, which can usually be easily mistaken for headphones. Then as I was standing up to say bye to the girl, her mom noticed them in my ears. She thought I was wearing headphones the whole time and wasn't paying attention to the little girl. This made her furious and a second later, I felt her grab my head. All I remember was feeling the worst pain I've ever felt in my ear. I turned around to see her holding my hearing aid and realized what she did. She thought I was listening to music. She ripped my hearing aid. Out of my ear, thinking it was a headphone. And since they connect directly to my eardrum, she completely ripped that out, too. The pain was so intense I passed out and woke up in the hospital to my mom crying. She was livid. And even though they begged us not to, we sued her. I will never hear out of my ear again, but I'll never have to work again either.

I could barely understand what she was saying through her sobbing, but she told me she had just swallowed an entire bottle of pills and just wanted someone to talk to before they did anything. I started asking her why she would do that and asked for her address. She thought I already had it, but after a few minutes she finally told me where she lived. She said she was severely depressed and just wanted everything to end. I asked her why. Just trying to keep her on the phone and she said she couldn't take the hate she was getting anymore. I knew I only had literal minutes to do something and tried talking her into throwing up. She told me no, so I asked her what kind of hate she was getting. Apparently she just wanted people to like her and wanted to help people. She was getting a lot of hate comments on TikTok and even people in real life. Then it all clicked. I knew I recognized her voice and I actually knew who she was. After a few minutes I asked her if she was who I thought and she was really surprised. I started to tell her how one of her Videos actually changed my life and got me out of a toxic relationship. She knew I wasn't lying because I told her all about it. I asked her one more time, and she finally agreed to try and make herself throw up. She was unconscious when the paramedics got there, but because of that, she was still alive. She now has millions of followers, and I'm glad to see her much happier today.

I went to a public school that love to control its students and one day they introduced the dumbest rule I've ever heard. Apparently they thought too many people were out in the halls instead of learning. So one morning they announced that students were no longer allowed to go to the bathroom during class. I literally thought it was a joke at first people started getting detention for being in the halls during class. Didn't matter how bad you had to pee, you simply weren't allowed to go. I remember watching a few people sit through class in pain because they couldn't go. But that was nothing compared to one girl. We were in art class and that teacher had got into multiple arguments with our principal about the rule. A lot of people loved this teacher, but I think our principal even threatened to fire him. So when a girl in my class was dying to go pee, he couldn't let her. She ended up sitting there in pain butting for 20 minutes and wasn't gonna make it until lunch. So since he wasn't gonna let her pee her pants in front of all her friends, our art teacher decided to walk her over to our art storage room. He stood outside the door and she peed in a bucket. Pretty good move on his part. Now, he wasn't gonna lose his job. That's what you think. Turns out A few bratty kids in our class knew what she did and started telling their parents. The news of it spread, and soon enough, reporters were at our school questioning him. The next day, there was a news article about how that teacher made the girl pee in a bucket but didn't mention our school's rule at all. Our school's administration panicked, and guess who they blamed? They fired him for creating an unsafe environment.

When my son was in the third grade, he was a bully. We tried everything, but he kept constantly getting in trouble and sent to the office. He was known throughout the school for tying balloons to the class rabbit and almost letting it float away. I was leaving work to go get him and as my phone rang, I already knew who it was. I had a special ringtone for his teacher because she called me so much just so I could prepare to hear what he did. She was crying when I answered and I knew it was bad. I told her I was on the way, but instead of getting upset, she started to thank me. I was really confused and she started to talk about what a sweet boy I raised. Literally nobody had ever told me that before. And I asked what happened. Apparently another kid who didn't have a lot of friends was in his class and his mom had handed out birthday invitations to everyone the day before. Right before the bell went off, he stood up in front of everyone and asked who was coming to his party. Entire class was now silent and he just stood there looking around for someone to tell him they were going. Nobody was saying anything and she said she could see the kids heart literally breaking in real time. Then as he went to sit back down in shame, my son stood up and said, I'm gonna come. I'll be there. His face lit up, and one by one all the other boys in the class followed his lead and also started telling him they'd come, too. He was trying not to cry when we showed up that weekend.

I remember sitting in math when the bell rang, and I started walking towards the library to eat lunch. I was starving. There was nowhere to sit except the very back. As soon as I sat down, I remember hearing a sound from the hallway that sounded like a door slamming onto the ground. Nobody really reacted, but then we heard a girl screaming outside the library. She came running down the hallway, and we heard the noise again. It was so silent in there until she yelled, somebody help! He has a gun! And everyone completely panicked. I remember freezing up because I didn't know where to go. The room was all windows, and everyone started flooding out the back door. I move, and another guy went to hide in a utility closet behind us. He told me to come inside, so I did. We sat there silently crying for about five minutes, slugging our ears. It felt like hours. And everyone screaming was gone. It was so quiet. So we opened the window on the door slightly to see out. As soon as I did, I saw they were inside the library. We stayed as silent as we possibly could, and my mom wouldn't stop texting me. We couldn't move, but I realized if my mom calls me, my phone would go off. If she called me, we probably wouldn't survive. We sat there with our Hands over our mouths, trying to breathe as quietly as we could. And I was praying they wouldn't look inside. We could hear them right outside the closet we were in. But they started running out, and we heard the police in the school. We sat there for another hour until the police found us. And we made it out safe. When I asked my mom why she didn't call me, she said she didn't want it to ring in case I might be hiding

My first few months as a 9 1 1 operator were scary, but nothing could have prepared me for when I got a call late at night from a young girl. I could barely understand what she was saying through her sobbing, but she told me she had just swallowed an entire bottle of pills and just wanted someone to talk to before they did anything. I started asking her why she would do that and asked for her address. She thought I already had it. But after a few minutes, she finally told me where she lived. She said she was severely depressed and just wanted everything to end. I asked her why, just trying to keep her on the phone and she said she couldn't take the hate she was getting anymore. I knew I only had literal minutes to do something and tried talking her into throwing up. She told me no. So I asked her what kind of hate she was getting. Apparently, she just wanted people to like her and wanted to help people. She was getting a lot of hate comments on TikTok and even people in real life. Then it all clicked. I knew I recognized her voice and I actually knew who she was. After a few minutes, I asked her if she was who I thought and she was really surprised. I started to tell her how one of her Videos actually changed my life and got me out of a toxic relationship. She knew I wasn't lying because I told her all about it. I asked her one more time and she finally agreed to try and make herself throw up. She was unconscious when the paramedics got there, but because of that, she was still alive. She now has millions of followers and I'm glad to see her much happier today.

When I was 17, my mom forced me to start babysitting, but I had no idea who I was doing it for. When I met this woman, I couldn't believe how overprotective she was. She had cameras in every room of the house and asked me to call her every half hour just to make sure her daughter was okay. She told me I wasn't allowed to do anything except watch her. And when she finally left, I basically just sat there for three hours doing nothing until she came home. She came back and basically ran into the room to make sure the girl was okay and I assured her everything was fine. I had long hair at the time and had put it up at this point. And should probably now mention I have severe hearing loss. I have to wear hearing aids, which can usually be easily mistaken for headphones. Then as I was standing up to say bye to the girl, her mom noticed them in my ears. She thought I was wearing headphones the whole time and wasn't paying attention to the little girl. This made her furious and a second later, I felt her grab my head. All I remember was feeling the worst pain I've ever felt in my ear. I turned around to see her holding my hearing aid and realized what she did. She thought I was listening to music. She ripped my hearing aid. Out of my ear, thinking it was a headphone. And since they connect directly to my eardrum, she completely ripped that out, too. The pain was so intense I passed out and woke up in the hospital to my mom crying. She was livid. And even though they begged us not to, we sued her. I will never hear out of my ear again, but I'll never have to work again either.

A really well known celebrity that graduated from our high school was coming to speak one morning and a lot of the girls were really excited. But an hour before it was supposed to start, we were told to go to the gym and not bring anything. When I walked in, there were police dogs and officers searching everybody. Nobody really thought it was weird because this person was famous. But when everyone was inside the gym, we were told we weren't allowed to leave. This is when it started to seem weird. And after a while, some people were asking to go to the bathroom. They had to be escorted by police officers and they started asking every guy wearing a gray shirt to come down and talk to them. Lunch passed and people were getting angry and we had to eat in the gym. Nobody knew what was happening and none of the teachers would say anything. cops kept showing up to talk to people and wouldn't let anyone leave. One guy tried to fight one of the cops when he wouldn't let him out and they actually arrested him. It was past the end of school and still nobody was allowed out of the gym. Parents couldn't pick us up either because they couldn't even come on the property. the entire school was surrounded and everyone was getting really mad. So our principal finally told us what Was going on. She sounded really on edge and told us the police were searching the school because there was a bomb threat in one of the bathrooms. I'll never forget how quiet it was and everyone was terrified. Nobody was allowed to leave until they found who did it. But after a half hour, they took another kid down and arrested him. We all knew it was him because we were allowed to leave after. But it was surprising because he was one of the popular guys. Everyone knew this was super weird for him. But the next morning we found out what happened and nobody could believe they looked through the cameras for the entire day because one of our older teachers had heard a boy in a gray shirt say something in the hallway. Turns out he completely misunderstood what he meant when he overheard him telling another boy that he was going to blow up the bathroom later that day.

I went to a public school that love to control its students and one day they introduced the dumbest rule I've ever heard. Apparently they thought too many people were out in the halls instead of learning. So one morning they announced that students were no longer allowed to go to the bathroom during class. I literally thought it was a joke at first people started getting detention for being in the halls during class. Didn't matter how bad you had to pee, you simply weren't allowed to go. I remember watching a few people sit through class in pain because they couldn't go. But that was nothing compared to one girl. We were in art class and that teacher had got into multiple arguments with our principal about the rule. A lot of people loved this teacher, but I think our principal even threatened to fire him. So when a girl in my class was dying to go pee, he couldn't let her. She ended up sitting there in pain butting for 20 minutes and wasn't gonna make it until lunch. So since he wasn't gonna let her pee her pants in front of all her friends, our art teacher decided to walk her over to our art storage room. He stood outside the door and she peed in a bucket. Pretty good move on his part. Now, he wasn't gonna lose his job. That's what you think. Turns out A few bratty kids in our class knew what she did and started telling their parents. The news of it spread, and soon enough, reporters were at our school questioning him. The next day, there was a news article about how that teacher made the girl pee in a bucket but didn't mention our school's rule at all. Our school's administration panicked, and guess who they blamed? They fired him for creating an unsafe environment.

I stared at her waiting for some explanation, some context that would make those words make sense. But she just closed her eyes with this keeful expression like she'd finally gotten something off her chest. An hour later, she was gone. The funeral was small. My mother didn't have many friends and I was her only family, or so I thought. People kept telling me how sorry they were for my loss, how she was such a devoted mother, how proud she must have been of me. I just nodded and smiled. But her last words kept echoing in my head. For three weeks, I couldn't function. I'd wake up at 3:00am replaying that moment. What did she mean? Was I adopted? Did she have an affair? Was there some family secret she took to her grave? My co workers started asking if I was okay. I'd zone out during meetings, stare at my computer screen for hours without typing a word. My girlfriend Sarah kept suggesting therapy. But how do you explain to a therapist that your dying mother basically told you that you weren't her real kid? I started going through old family photos, looking for clues. In every single picture, my mother looked distant. Even in photos from my childhood birthdays, she had this forced smile like she was performing the role of a happy mother rather than actually being one. Then I remembered how She used to disappear every year on my birthday. She'd make me breakfast, give me presents, sing Happy Birthday. But then around noon, she'd always say she had errands to run. She'd be gone for hours, coming back quiet and sad. I always thought she was visiting my father's grave, but now I wondered. Then I found her old address book. There were names and numbers I didn't recognize, including one entry that just said d, important dates with a phone number. No last name, no address, just d. That's when I decided I had to go through everything in her house systematically. I've been putting it off, but I needed answers. I started in her bedroom, going through drawers, closets, boxes under the bed. Most of it was normal stuff, old bills, jewelry, clothes that still smelled like her perfume. But then in the very back of her closet, behind winter coat she never wore, I found a small metal lock box. It was heavy and when I shook it, I could hear papers shuffling inside. The key was taped underneath her jewelry box. She always hid things in the most obvious places. My hands were shaking as I opened it. Inside were birth certificates, mine yellowed with age, and another one with the exact same date, same hospital, same time of birth, but a different name, David Michael Thompson. The mother's name was the same, Margaret Thompson, my mother. I had a twin brother. But that wasn't all. There were letters, dozens of them, written in my mother's handwriting, birthday cards, Christmas cards, graduation cards, all addressed to my dearest David, photos of a boy who looked exactly like me at every age.

My wife, Stephanie, waited until we were eating dessert at Cassie and Paul's house to drop this on me. We should swap partners every Thursday, she said. And I literally watched her put her hand on Paul's thigh under the table. I saw it. Cassie saw it, too, and her face went blank. What? I asked? Because I honestly thought I heard her wrong. Partner swapping? We date each other's spouses. She said it like she was talking about switching cars for the weekend. Paul kept staring at his plate and wouldn't make eye contact with me. It's already decided, Stephanie said. Thursday nights, you take Cassie out, Paul takes me. I felt my chest get tight. When did they decide this without me? This is insane, I told her. Then she leaned in close and whispered. Room 2:37 last Tuesday when you were at work. My whole body went numb. She was telling me she'd already cheated and now wanted my permission to keep doing it. So are you in or not? She asked louder. I looked at Cassie and she was crying without making any sound. Fine, I said, let's swap partners. Stephanie smiled like she just won something. But then I noticed Cassie had stopped crying completely. That should have told me something right there. When the first date night came around, Stephanie spent forever getting ready. Put on this red Dress I've never seen before, that she'd been hiding in our closet. Paul's car was already running in our driveway when I left. I brought Cassie white roses because I remembered she mentioned liking them once. Her hands shook when she took them. Paul never. She started, then stopped at dinner. She pushed her food around and barely ate anything. You okay? I asked. Paul's been different, she said quietly, for months, even before. Then she stopped talking again. I reached over and touched her hand before. What? Nothing. Forget I said anything. But then her phone lit up with Stephanie's name and she turned it face down. Immediately I got home that night, Stephanie was already there. Her hair was all messed up and her lipstick was smeared on the wrong side of her mouth. How was Cassie? Good. How was Paul? Then she started telling me everything they did, the hotel room, the balcony, what they did against the wall. She kept getting louder with each detail. Stop, I told her. Why? Don't you wanna know? No, her face got all twisted up. Well, I'm telling you anyway. She kept going with more details while I pulled out my phone and texted Cassie, thank you for a lovely evening. Stephanie saw my screen and threw her wine glass at the wall. It shattered everywhere and I just stood there looking at her. The next week, I had to pick Cassie up because her car broke down out of Nowhere. Paul was supposed to drive me, she said, looking confused. I forgot at dinner she had way too much wine. Can I tell you something? She asked. And her eyes looked glassy. Tuesday afternoons, that's when it started. My heart started racing. What started? She covered her mouth with her hand. Nothing. Forget it. But Tuesday was when Stephanie had mentioned the hotel and we both knew what she meant. Then we had to go to Stephanie's parents'house for dinner. Stephanie showed up late and I could smell Paul's Cologne all over her clothes. Her mom.

My 13 year old son, Alex asked if he could download a chess app on his tablet. I was shocked. All his friends were begging for Fortnite or some zombie game, and here's my kid wanting to play chess. I said yes immediately. See, I'm pretty strict about screen time. No games, no social media. Homework first. Alex has always been quiet, kind of awkward around other kids. Chess seemed perfect for building his brain. He got obsessed fast. Every day after school, straight to his room with that tablet. I'd hear him muttering moves under his breath. Night to E4, check. When I asked how it was going, he'd light up, talking about strategy and logic patterns. Months in, I noticed something weird. He'd quickly close the tablet whenever I walked in. Said he was just thinking through positions. Then one night, I heard him talking. Not muttering chess moves, actually talking to someone. I knocked. Who are you talking to? Just practicing out loud, dad. Helps me think. My gut said something was wrong. Next day, I checked his tablet while he was at school. The chess app was deleted. Completely gone. When I asked him about it, he said he took a break and was doing puzzles in his head now. That's when I installed tracking software. Took me three days to figure out how, but I did it.

So Alex responded by beating him in front of 200 people while explaining each mistake the coach made. The school said it was unsportsmanlike conduct. Alex never told me. Just said he quit the team because it was boring. So for months, he'd been rebuilding his reputation online, earning money, and getting revenge on everyone who'd written him Off the fake chess app. Wasn't about being lazy. It was about hiding how good he actually was. That night at dinner, I put a chess board between us. Wanna play a quick game? His face went white. Dad, I don't really. One game. Humor your old man.

My 13 year old son, Alex asked if he could download a chess app on his tablet. I was shocked. All his friends were begging for Fortnite or some zombie game, and here's my kid wanting to play chess. I said yes immediately. See, I'm pretty strict about screen time. No games, no social media. Homework first. Alex has always been quiet, kind of awkward around other kids. Chess seemed perfect for building his brain. He got obsessed fast. Every day after school, straight to his room with that tablet. I'd hear him muttering moves under his breath. Night to E4, check. When I asked how it was going, he'd light up, talking about strategy and logic patterns. Months in, I noticed something weird. He'd quickly close the tablet whenever I walked in. Said he was just thinking through positions. Then one night, I heard him talking. Not muttering chess moves, actually talking to someone. I knocked. Who are you talking to? Just practicing out loud, dad. Helps me think. My gut said something was wrong. Next day, I checked his tablet while he was at school. The chess app was deleted. Completely gone. When I asked him about it, he said he took a break and was doing puzzles in his head now. That's when I installed tracking software. Took me three days to figure out how, but I did it. What I found made my blood boil. He'd Been using a fake chess app that was actually a cover for some underground gambling site. He was playing speed chess for money against adults online. Real money.

And suddenly it's like musical chairs, but your chair disappeared. Like it's instant. People don't even wait. They already sliding across the room, locking in with their besties, acting like they rehearsed it. And me, I'm just sitting there fake smiling, pretending I'm not slowly panicking inside. You try to play it cool, looking around casually, acting like you're just taking your time. Deep down you're screaming, please, somebody make eye contact with me. And somehow everyone just knows how to avoid you. Like your whole class became trained professionals and not seeing you. It's like they went blind with precision. You shift in your seat a little, do that awkward cough like, hey, I'm still here. Nothing. Then the teacher hits you with the, oh, looks like you don't have a partner. Thanks for announcing it to the entire room, Mrs. Ava. Why not just put me under a spotlight and cue the sad violin while you're at it? And the worst part, the teacher sees it, oh, you don't have a partner. Hmm. Okay, just join that group over there, bro. That group already teamed up, planned the project, probably already gave each other nicknames and now I gotta slide in like the substitute friend. It's always the quiet group too. So now we're all just awkwardly pretending to be okay while not saying a single word at that point. I'm like, you know what, I'll work alone. I'll suffer in silence. At least I don't gotta ask someone if I can use their glue stick. And don't even get me started on when the teacher just assigns you to the one person in class you don't get along with. Now y'all gotta pretend to be civil for 5 minutes while exchanging half hearted ideas and silently judging each other's handwriting.

I swear bro is secretly an owl because they never go to bed until it's brighter than the billboards in Times Square. It becomes genuinely impossible to make plans with them because their whole sleep schedule is comparable to Batman.

It genuinely gets to a point where I go weeks without seeing them because we're never awake at the same time.

So I did exactly that and watched her world crumble. She watched me get down on one knee five times and said no every single time. Eight years together. I've been playing husband since year 2. Paying her car note, keeping her on my insurance, covering most of the rent while she found herself through three different careers. She had this whole routine down. Tears in her eyes, hand on her heart. Then some perfectly rehearsed excuse. We're not ready, let's wait till we're more stable. The timing isn't right. Then came proposal No. 5. And she finally showed me who she really was. I'd gone all out this time. I'm convinced myself that maybe the problem was I hadn't made it special enough. I rented out her favorite restaurants, rooftop, hung string lights everywhere, and invited all our friends and family there. The whole production cost me three months salary, but I thought it'd be worth it. When she finally said yes. My girlfriend stood there in the dress I'd bought her, surrounded by everyone we knew. And she didn't even let me finish the speech. Just shook her head with this pitying smile. Like I was a dog that wouldn't stop bringing her the same stick. Back at our apartment that night, I finally broke. Asked her straight up if she loved me. Why did she keep doing this? Her whole face changed in an instant. And the Mask came completely off. It's my choice when I accept a proposal, she said, voice ice cold. You don't get to pressure me with your timeline. You're my boyfriend, so act like one. Stop trying to be my husband when I haven't even accepted your proposal. Know your place. Know my place? After eight years of building a life together, I was supposed to know my place? Those words rewired something in my brain. Eight years of playing husband while she kept me a boyfriend status because it was convenient for her. She wanted me to act like a boyfriend. Fine. I give her exactly what she asked for. But boyfriends don't pay their girlfriends bills. Boyfriends don't share bank accounts. Boyfriends don't sacrifice their futures for someone who won't even wear their ring. I started my new boyfriend only policy the next morning while she was at her yoga class. First, I sold the ring to a dealer for 12 grand, enough to cover what I'd spent on her car this year alone. Then I called Verizon and removed her from my phone plan. By the time she got home from yoga, I changed every password and moved my money from our joint account. Didn't even notice until lunch when her phone died mid phone call. Babe, my phone's not working. She texted from her laptop, annoyed but not worried. Call Verizon. It's being weird. An hour later, they said, I'm not on the account anymore. Then the panic Started creeping in. What did you do? I responded, I'm being your boyfriend and not your husband, just like you said. She actually laughed at first, thinking it was some kind of joke. She came home that night, acting extra sweet. Made my favorite dinner and tried to cuddle on the couch. Okay, you made your point, she said, kissing my neck. I'll think about what you said. Now fix my phone. I moved to the guest bedroom instead. The next morning, she couldn't log into Netflix. Then Hulu died.

Aunt Patricia watched my plate like a hawk. Sweetie, are you sure you need the mashed potatoes and the rice? Then came the clothing comments. That's a brave choice wearing horizontal stripes. You know, dark colors are more slimming. I tried everything. I asked her privately to please stop focusing on my body. I told her it hurt my feelings. I even brought articles about body positivity. She patted my hand and say she was just looking out for me because she loved me. That opened the flood gates. Patricia has a point about portion control. My cousin Jennifer chimed in at Thanksgiving. Have you tried intermittent fasting? I could send you some links. Uncle Rob began his helpful gym advice. You know, muscle burns more calories. My 12 year old nephew started asking if I really needed dessert. Even grandma, sweet grandma, started saying things like, you have such a pretty face. If only my birthday dinner last month was when they took it too far. As I reached for a second slice of my own birthday cake, the entire table collectively sucked in their breath. Aunt Diane actually moved the cake. Go away from me. We're doing this because we love you, she said. Fifteen relatives nodded an agreement. The next family dinner, I came prepared. Aunt Patricia reached for the bread and I gasped. Patricia, carbs after six? That's brave. She froze, hand midair. I kept.

Every Thursday for three years, I told my wife Becca the same thing. I'm going to hang with the boys tonight. Be back around midnight. Truth is, I was driving to the cinema to watch movies alone because I just needed some me time. But then two months ago, my movie ended abruptly, and I came home two hours earlier than planned. When I turned onto our street, there was a black Infinity in our driveway. My heart stopped as I watched back all the footage from our doorbell camera and saw a man getting out of the car and walk. Hang up like he'd done it before. Becca opened. Before he could ring, they kissed. The kind where her hand went to his neck. My stomach dropped. I wanted to burst through that door and confront them, but I decided on the spot that that would be too kind. I need. Needed to do something else. Something that would destroy her. So I drove around until 12:30 and walked in with a story about Tony getting drunk. Becca was showering. Hey, babe. How was your night? Good. You know how it is. Then next two Thursdays, I kept my routine, but park down the street at 8:30 to watch. At the same time, the same car pulled up. I zoomed in on the ring footage, and that's when it hit me. The man was Mark. Mark, who supposedly moved to Seattle. Two years ago, my knees were shaking, but I took screenshots and sent them to my lawyer to further build my case. When I was confident enough that I had everything basically set up, I dropped the bomb. Becca was going on about her fake plans for when I left for Boys Night, when I randomly blurted out, you know who I miss? Mark. That guy and I used to have so much fun before he moved to Seattle. Her fork stopped halfway to her mouth just for a second. Yeah, Mark was great. You guys still text, though, right? Sometimes. The next morning, she woke up different, with this nervous energy. She made some phone calls behind closed doors, and since it was Thursday, during lunch, she texted, what time are you heading out tonight? She never asked before, so I knew. The comment about Mark got her. Probably 7:30. Why? Just wondering. The guys doing anything special? Same old. After work. She was cooking in full makeup. You look nice, I said. Just felt like making an effort for you to come home to. But she kept checking her phone and setting it down, then pick getting it back up at 7:15. She practically pushed me out. Don't want you to be late. Tell everyone I say hi. I drove to my regular spot down the street where I watched them, but this time, there was no car that showed up. And at 9:15, Becca's own car pulled Out. I followed her. First stop, O'malley Sports Bar, where she thought I'd be. She walked in confidently, then came out five minutes later looking confused, checking her phone, scanning the parking lot. Then she got back in her car. Her second stop, the dugout, another sports bar. Through the windows, I watched her walk the entire place, moving table to table, even checking the bathroom entrance area. She showed her phone to a waitress, who shrugged. Back to the car, more frantic phone checking. Third stop, Buffalo Wild Wings. She stayed longer this time, 15 minutes. I could see her at the bar talking to the manager, showing him something on her phone. Probably my pic. He shook his head, pointed to their mostly empty tables. Thursday wasn't exactly Prime Sports Bar night. Fourth stop, the dive bar where Tony actually used to drag us. She went straight to the bartender. I slipped in through the side door, ducked into the hallway by the bathrooms. Heard her say, every Thursday night, group of guys, probably five or six of them, loud. One of them looks like this. The bartender studied her phone. Thursday's our slowest night. I definitely remember a regular group. Sorry. She left looking frustrated, sat in her car for five minutes typing furiously. Then she drove to the A M C. Theater. I gave her a 10 minute head start, then walked in through the side entrance. She was at the concession stand talking to the Teenage manager showed her phone again. He pointed toward the theaters. She went to check each one. Open doors, scanning the sparse Thursday night crowds. I went back to my car. Twenty minutes later, she emerged, looking defeated. Sat in her car for another 10 minutes. Through her rear window, I could see her on the phone, gesturing with her free hand. Probably calling Mark. Probably saying she couldn't find me anywhere. That maybe I knew that Thursday nights might not be safe anymore. She even drove by two more bars on the way home. Quick stops, desperate checks. When I got home at my your time, she was on the couch with wine, trying to look casual, but her leg was bouncing. How was your night? Studying. Guys go. Oh, Malley's. Why? Her jaw clenched. No reason. Just curious. Was it busy? Pretty dead, actually. Who all was there? Haven't heard their names in a while. The usual.

When I was 17, my classmate Derek threw 50 bucks at me in the school parking lot and desperately said, I need you to be my boyfriend for one hour to scare off my mom's church friends. His mom thought he was gay because she found his elaborate skincare routine and absolutely freaked out. She was bringing her entire prayer circle over for what she called a healing intervention to save Derek's soul from eternal damnation. Act super gay and make them uncomfortable, Derek explained frantically while pacing nervously. They'll get so weirded out, they'll pack up and leave within 20 minutes. Easy money, right? I showed up at exactly 3 p m. Wearing the tightest jeans I could squeeze into and a bright pink shirt. I knocked on the door and screamed Derek, baby! So loud that neighbors three houses down started coming outside to see what could trophy was happening. His mom answered with five absolutely horrified church ladies clustered behind her like a religious huddle preparing for spiritual warfare. I immediately bear hugged Derek and loudly announced sweetie pie. I brought us matching cucumber face masks and a carefully curated playlist of Broadway show tunes for our romantic spa day. Derek's face went complete pale, but I was fully committed to this Oscar worthy performance. For the next hour, I went into full theater kid mode like my life depended on it. I called him Sugar Plum. Honey Bunny and my precious little cinnamon roll. I critiqued his mom's curtain choices with the intensity of a professional interior designer, started reorganizing their entire spice rack alphabetically while humming songs from Hamilton, and loudly complained that their throw pillows didn't match the seasonal aesthetic vision. And I was going for. The church ladies looked like they were watching a slow motion car crash that they couldn't look away from. One kept fanning herself frantically with a church program. Another was gripping her purse like it was a life preserver in a stormy sea. Then I made my absolutely fatal mistake. I spotted their old dusty piano sitting in the corner and declared dramatically, with full jazz hands, Derek, Honey, let's sing that special duet we've been practicing for the school talent show. Without waiting for his response, I launched into the most ridiculously over the top rendition of A Whole New World that is ever been performed outside of Broadway. Derek just stood there completely mortified and frozen like a deer in headlights. When I finished with a dramatic flourish, the church lady slowly started clapping. Then another joined in. Then all five of them erupted in thunderous applause like I had just performed at Carnegie Hall. Young man, the head church lady said, with actual tears streaming down her weathered face, that was the most beautiful, soul stirring thing I've ever heard in my entire life. Derek, you absolutely must marry this talented boy before someone else Snatches him up. Derek's mom immediately started planning our entire wedding on the spot, pulling out her phone to call venues and florists while I stood there still frozen in my final dramatic pose. But the situation got infinitely worse from there. The church ladies loved my performance so much that they invited me to sing at their Sunday morning service. They wanted me performing how great thou art with full choreography and backup dancers. One was already texting her granddaughter about hiring me for her Sweet 16 party. Derek was full on panicking at this point. His mom was already picking out flower arrangements and discussing catering menu options. One church lady was asking about my ring size and whether I preferred gold or silver wedding bands. Then Derek's little sister walked in from soccer practice, took one look at the complete chaos unfolding in their living room, and announced loudly to everyone, mom literally paid him $50 to pretend to be his boyfriend. I heard them planning this whole ridiculous scheme in the garage this morning. The silence that followed was absolutely deafening. Eric's mom slowly turned to stare at him with the fury of a thousand burning suns. The church ladies all stared at me in complete shock and bewilderment. I was still holding my jazz hands from the performance finale. Finally, after what felt like hours, the head church lady cleared her throat and said with perfect composure, well, Derek, at least we know you have Absolutely excellent taste in entertainment. She turned to me with a business like expression. Are you available for my granddaughter's wedding reception next month? We'll pay triple what Derek gave you. Derek still owes me another hundred dollars because I ended up singing at four more church events that month, including a funeral where I performed Amazing Grace with interpretive dance. His mom still asks me when we're setting our wedding date.

Like at first we're watching movies, eating snacks, all good vibes. But the second the lights go out, chaos. Suddenly someone's laughing at nothing for 20 minutes straight. Another kid is making shadow puppets on the wall like it's a Broadway show. And there's always that one kid who forgets to bring anything. No pillow, no blanket, just vibes. He's over there sleeping on the carpet using a hoodie as a mattress. And there's the group that swears they're staying up all night. Big talk at midnight. But by 12:30, half of them are knocked out brutally and the other half are wide awake arguing if aliens are real. And the food situation, wild. You got 10 people fighting over the last slice of pizza like it's a custody battle. Someone's sneaking chips at 4:00am and the crinkle of the bag might as well be a fire alarm. When morning comes, everyone wakes up looking like they've survived a natural disaster. Hair's a mess, someone's missing a sock and the kid who slept on the floor can't walk straight anymore. Best part, parents roll in. Like, so did you guys get some rest? Yeah, sure. If by rest you mean four minutes of sleep and permanent brain damage.

My life has been a living hell since they found my channel, and it's getting worse every day, all because of one group of girls. Like, it started with hate comments and putting pictures in my locker, but the final straw was when they came into school and handed me a T-shirt of my channel, asking if I could sign it since I'm so famous. And, bro, her friends acted like this was the funniest thing they'd ever seen. But I wasn't gonna just let this slide now, so I did some digging and found all their social media channels and saw that they're actually trying to blow up on TikTok themselves, just not with much success. So since they wanna be famous, I'll make them famous by exposing everything they said, all in this video, then sending it to their parents, future college, and blowing this video up for millions to see.

Like I don't even think historians are gonna know how to write this down. We literally got two new seasons in one month. An immortal person casually existing, a priest who went to hell and actually threw hands with Satan, radioactive nuclear spiders and then somehow the UK decided to spawn human sized rat. Oh, and the Black Plague made a comeback in 2025. But wait, it gets worse. Aliens are apparently landing in November. Citra out here building a 10 foot tall Terminator, animatronic, the Boo Boo dolls confirmed to be affiliated with the Devil. Ice cream trucks mysteriously appearing again like it's 2006. The iPhone 17 straight up leak. And then Roblox. Bro, Roblox was on another level of insanity. They said he sent an assist letter to SLEP which backfired so hard that SLEP actually clapped back. Roblox stock tanked by $12 billion. He dropped an AI generated apology. Chris Hanson pulled up, law by Mike pulled up and even the state of Louisiana started suing Roblox. Then out of nowhere, the US congressman gets involved. Roblox starts getting banned in countries like Qatar and Indonesia. And both the US and UK governments are now investigating Roblox for safety issues. While all this chaos is happening, creators like kreekraft are leaving the star program. And the best news of all, I got nearly 80,000 people to subscribe to my channel this month. Bro, August wasn't a month, it was An entire Netflix series.

It started at Thanksgiving when my cousin wouldn't shut up about me being single. She kept asking why I never brought anyone home, making these fake concerned faces at the dinner table. So when she said, I must be dating someone special, I just nodded, gave him a name right on the spot. Daniel said he was busy with work. My family ate it up. But then Christmas rolled around and my mom started asking when she could meet Daniel. My aunt kept texting about setting an extra place at dinner. I was stuck. That's when my roommate Becca suggested her coworker, Daniel, who owed her big time for covering his shifts. She showed me his Instagram, tall brown hair, actually decent looking. He agreed to one dinner as a favor. The problem, he didn't just show up and fake smile through dinner. He brought flowers for my mom, asked my dad about his woodworking hobby and somehow knew my grandmother collected vintage tea cups because I'd mentioned it once when building the fake story. He even laughed at my little brother's terrible jokes about robots. My family was obsessed. After that first dinner, my mom kept inviting him back, Easter brunch, my cousin's graduation party, random Sunday dinners. Daniel never said no. He text me beforehand asking what to bring, if anyone had allergies, stuff like that. He started sending my brother updates about basketball. Scores. My dad asked him to help fix our back porch. The worst part was how natural it felt. We drive to my parents house together and he'd ask about my day like we actually dated. He remembered my coffee order, knew I hated mushrooms, grab my jacket when I got cold. During family game night, he'd automatically pick me as his partner. We had inside jokes that weren't even planned. One night after my aunt's birthday party, we sat in his car outside my apartment in complete silence. Everyone had spent the whole night saying how perfect we looked together, how lucky I was. My grandmother even pulled me aside to say Daniel was a keeper. The whole car ride home, I kept stealing glances at him, wondering what he was thinking. I started rehearsing speeches in my bathroom mirror, practice bringing it up casually over coffee. But every time I opened my mouth, nothing came out. How do you tell someone you caught feelings for a fake relationship? Everything changed at Christmas dinner. My aunt announced she'd been looking at wedding venues for us. She found the perfect place for next fall. Daniel laughed it off perfectly, made some joke about her getting ahead of herself. But later that night, he texted me, we can't keep this up forever. You know, that message hit me like a truck. I realized he was ready to end this whole thing and I wasn't, not even close. Instead of texting back, Or giving him some weird speech. I invited him over for dinner at my place, cooked his favorite pasta dish, the one my mom always made when he came over, set the table with actual candles, not just the overhead light. After we finished eating, I was washing dishes and he was drying them, just like we did at my parents house. That's when I finally said it. I know this whole thing started as pretend, but it doesn't feel fake.

She returned 6 years later to find I'd divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2 3 years, max. Change the locks. She left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation. To our eight year olds, that first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home, and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decision. It's no more walking on eggshells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curveball. Our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year two brought unexpected changes. Without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I've been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd forgotten how to enjoy My children. Year three changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partner ship could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually, she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her bonus mom. Their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes, and tucked them in at night. Year five was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and be being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year six, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward. After three Years of zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from the living room. Through the window, we watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she own

It started when my sister Chloe came home crying because her boyfriend Jake dumped her. She's 25 and I'm 17, but she always acts like she's the victim in every situation. This time was different, though. She kept saying Jake was horrible and cruel. But when I asked what happened, she got all shifty. He said he broke up with her out of nowhere and kicked her out of his apartment. But then she mentioned she still had keys to his place because she forgot to give them back the next day. She left early in the morning and came back with this huge golden retriever. I recognized him immediately. It was Buster, Jake's dog. Jake love that dog more than anything. When his grandpa died last year, Buster was the only thing that helped him through it. I asked Chloe why she had Buster and she got this weird smile on her face. She said Jake didn't deserve to keep him since he broke her heart. Then she said something that made my stomach drop. She told me she was going to take Buster to the vet tomorrow to put him down as payback for what Jake did to her. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. This dog was completely healthy and happy, just confused about being in a new place. Buster kept looking around for Jake and whining by the door. It was heartbreaking. I told Chloe she was being insane and she couldn't just kill someone's dog because she was upset. She laughed and said Jake should have thought about that before he decided to hurt her. Then she said if I told anyone, she'd make sure I regretted it. That night I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about Buster and how scared he must be. Around 2:00am, I heard Chloe on the phone with someone probably making the vet appointment. I knew I had to do something. Then next morning, Chloe left for work and told mom she was taking Buster for a walk later. Mom didn't know the whole story. Chloe just said Jake asked her to watch his dog for a few days. As soon as both then were gone, I called Jake. He picked up on the first ring and sounded terrible. I told him Chloe had Buster and was planning to put him down today. He went completely silent for like 10 seconds, then started freaking out. He said he'd been looking everywhere for Buster and thought maybe he got out somehow. I told Jake to come over now while Chloe was at work. He was at our house in 15 minutes. When he saw Buster, he literally started crying. Buster went crazy with excitement, jumping all over him and licking his face. I opened the door and Jake carried his dog out to his car. Before he left, Jake told me what really happened with Chloe. She Didn't just get dumped. She cheated on him with his best friend, Marcus. When Jake found out, he broke up with her and told her to move out. She stole Buster on her way out and left Jake's spare key on the counter so he thought she was being mature about the breakup. A few hours later, Chloe came home and went straight to look for Buster when she couldn't find him. She started screaming my name. She found me in my room and absolutely lost it. She called me a traitor and said I had no right to interfere in her business. Then mom came home and asked what all the yelling was about. Chloe told her I let some guy steal her dog. She made it sound like I just gave away her pet to a random stranger. Mom looked.

I responded, bros before hoes, but moms before all. And everyone cracked up. Jason didn't smile, though. His face drained of color like I just confessed to murder. He grabbed all his stuff and moved 3 rows up the school bus without a word. Jason, what's wrong? I was just kidding. I called after him, but he wouldn't turn around. That's when I heard it stay. Casey, my girlfriend's best friend, was crying her eyes out in the back row. When I turned to look, her friend whispered urgently in her ear and she glanced at me before crying harder. Okay, hey, that was definitely weird. I started to wonder whether my joke was really that offensive. That's when my phone buzzed. Three missed calls from dad, but there was no signal. And at the red light, I caught the bus driver wiping his eyes in the rearview mirror. In my three years of knowing him, the most emotion he'd shown was mild annoyance when kids left trash on the seats. A cold feeling crept into my stomach. I got up to go talk to Jason, but Missus Unfitzharris blocked the aisle. Sit down. We're moving. I just need to sit down. I'd never heard her voice like that. I sat. But the second we got to the destination, I cornered Jason. Dude, what is going On he backed away. Nothing. I just, I need space, bruh. I was just kidding. I don't know if I'd pick my mom or my girlfriend. Why did you have to tell everyone what I said? Sid appeared out of nowhere and pulled me aside. Our team captain who never said more.

They're basically a fucking different species. why are they always screaming when they see each other in the hallway? Oh my God, hi, bestie girl. You saw her five minutes ago at your locker. And they always travel in packs like a swarm of pink, overly perfumed pigeons. You're trying to get to class and the hallway is always blocked. One's filming a TikTok, the others re applying lip gloss like she's on the red carpet. Like, move, bitch, I'm trying to get to class on time. And don't get me started on their fake compliments to you. Oh my God, your shoes are so cute. Then they turn around and go, did you see what he was wearing? I heard you, bitch. I have ears. And why do they act like they're the CEO of everything? The group project, they did nothing but somehow got the most credit. Party. They didn't even host it, but they still say, oh my God, our party was so fun. They're not even popular. Everyone is just scared of them. Like if you make eye contact for too long, they'll scan your outfit, judge your entire existence and sentence you to eternal hallway awkwardness. Nah, bro. Popular girls are like NPCs with main character syndrome. Total idiots, loud and everywhere. Follow for more daily rants.

My 82 year old grandma Dorothy discovered Amazon Prime last month. This woman who still doesn't trust ATMs and hides cash in cookie tins somehow figured out one click ordering. It started innocently. My cousin set up her account so she could order sunflower seeds for the cardinals in her yard. First delivery, 40 pounds of bird seed. Perfect. Second delivery, 80 pounds of bird seed just in case. Third delivery, an inflatable hot tub. Grandma, why did you buy a hot tub? I didn't buy hot tub. I just pushed button. But since it's here, she set it up in her small backyard. Soon her neighbors, Mrs. Johnson, Mrs. Miller and Mrs. Green, all in their 70s, started coming over for joint therapy sessions. They sit in the hot tub fully clothed because as grandma says, bikinis are for teenagers. Fourth delivery, a karaoke machine for hot tub nights. Now every Thursday evening, four elderly women sit in a hot tub belting out Elvis and Dolly Parton songs at top volume. Fifth delivery, 120 cans of Vienna sausages. It was bargain such deal. Grandma, you don't even like Vienna sausages but raccoons do. She's now feeding every raccoon in the county. Premium sausages. 6 delivery, a drone. Why do you need a drone? To spy on squirrels from kitchen she flew at once. It's now stuck in Mr Johnson's oak tree. He's convinced it's government surveillance and sprays it with The garden hose every morning. Seventh delivery. A 70 inch TV. Old TV. Too small. Grandma, your old TV was 60 inches. Yes, too small. Hard to see Judge Judy. She watches Judge Judy at volume 90 and yells advice at the screen like she's a co judge. The breaking point was delivery number eight. Motorcycle helmet. Grandma, you don't have a motorcycle? Not yet. Not yet. That's when I checked her Amazon cart. She had a Harley Davidson saved for later. I changed her password immediately. Why ruin my fun? Because you almost bought a motorcycle. It had good reviews. Now she has to call me Lana to order anything. But she found a loophole. She Learned Instacart. Last week, 50 watermelons showed up at her door. They sell by watermelon, not by pound. Deal of lifetime. She handed out watermelons to neighbors, delivery guys, even the UPS driver. Our street looks like a farmers market. Yesterday she called Lana. What's cryptocurrency? Why? Man on Facebook says I can turn watermelons into Bitcoin. Grandma, no, but he wears suit and picture looks smart. I rushed over. She was about to invest in something called Agricoin. Grandma, it's a scam, he said. I'm genius investor called me Warren Buffett of Ohio. She pouted then perked up. Lana, while you're here, help me set up TikTok. Mrs. Miller says. I could be influencer. Her username is now at hot tub grandma. 82. She has 20,000 followers in three weeks. Her top Video feeding Vienna sausages to raccoons while singing Dolly Parton. Comments are all. Protect this woman at all costs. She reads every comment through giant reading glasses and replies, bless your heart.

Every Thursday for three years, I told my wife Becca the same thing. I'm going to hang with the boys tonight, be back around midnight. Truth is, I was driving to the cinema to watch movies alone because I just needed some me time. But then two months ago, my movie ended abruptly and I came home two hours earlier than planned. When I turned onto our street, there was a black infinity in our driveway. My heart stopped as I watched back all the footage from our doorbell camera and saw a man getting out of the car and walk hang up like he done it before. Becca opened, before he could ring, they kissed the kind where her hand went to his neck. My stomach dropped. I wanted to burst through that door and confront them, but I decided on the spot that that would be too kind. I need did to do something else, something that would destroy her. So I drove around until 12:30 and walked in with a story about Tony getting drunk. Becca was showering. Hey, babe, how was your night? Good. You know how it is. Then next two Thursdays, I kept my routine but park down the street at 8:30 to watch. At the same time, the same car pulled up. I zoomed in on the ring footage and that's when it hit me. The man was Mark. Mark who supposedly moved to Seattle. Two years ago, my knees were shaking, but I took screenshots and sent them to my lawyer to further build my case. When I was confident enough that I had everything basically set up, I dropped a bomb. Becca was going on about her fake plans for when I left for boys night when I randomly blurted out, you know who I miss? Mark. That guy and I used to have so much fun before he moved to Seattle. Her fork stopped halfway to her mouth just for a second. Yeah, Mark was great. You guys still text though, right? Sometimes. The next morning she woke up different with this nervous energy. She made some phone calls behind closed doors. And since it was Thursday during lunch, she texted, what time are you heading out tonight? She never asked before, so I knew the comment about Mark got her probably 7:30. Why? Just wondering. The guys doing anything special? Same old after work. She was cooking in full makeup. You look nice, I said. Just felt like making an effort for you to come home to. But she kept checking her phone and setting it down, then pick getting it back up at 7:15. She practically pushed me out. Don't want you to be late. Tell everyone I say hi. I drove to my regular spot down the street where I watched them, but this time there was no car that showed up. And at 9:15, Becca's own car pulled Out I followed her. First stop, O'malley Sports Bar, where she thought I'd be. She walked in confidently, then came out five minutes later looking confused, checking her phone, scanning the parking lot. Then she got back in her car. Her second stop, the dugout, another sports bar. Through the windows, I watched her walk the entire place, moving table to table, even checking the bathroom entrance area. She showed her phone to a waitress who shrugged. Back to the car, more frantic phone checking. Third stop, Buffalo Wild Wings. She stayed longer, this time, 15 minutes. I could see her at the bar talking to the manager, showing him something on her phone, probably my pic. He shook his head, pointed to their mostly empty tables. Thursday wasn't exactly prime sports bar night. Fourth stop, the dive bar where Tony actually used to drag us. She went straight to the bartender. I slipped in through the side door, ducked into the hallway by the bathrooms, heard her say every Thursday night, group of guys, probably five or six of them loud. One of them looks like this. The bartender studied her phone. Thursday's our slowest night. I definitely remember a regular group. Sorry. She left looking frustrated, sat in her car for five minutes typing furiously. Then she drove to the a m. C theater. I gave her a 10 minute head start, then walked in through the side entrance. She was at the concession stand talking to the Teenage manager showed her phone again. He pointed toward the theaters. She went to check each one. Open doors, scanning the sparse Thursday night crowds. I went back to my car. 20 minutes later, she emerged looking defeated, sat in her car for another 10 minutes. Through her rear window, I could see her on the phone gesturing with her free hand, probably calling Mark, probably saying she couldn't find me anywhere. That maybe I knew that Thursday nights might not be safe anymore. She even drove by two more bars on the way home. Quick stops, desperate checks. When I got home at my U full time, she was on the couch with wine, trying to look casual, but her leg was bouncing. How was your night? Studying my face. Good. Same as always. Yeah. Where exactly did you guys go? Oh, Malley's. Why? Her jaw clenched. No reason. Just curious. Was it busy? Pretty dead, actually. Who all was there? Haven't heard their names in a while. The usual.

It started when my sister Chloe came home crying because her boyfriend Jake dumped her. She's 25 and I'm 17, but she always acts like she's the victim in every situation. This time was different, though. She kept saying Jake was horrible and cruel. But when I asked what happened, she got all shifty. He said he broke up with her out of nowhere and kicked her out of his apartment. But then she mentioned she still had keys to his place because she forgot to give them back the next day. She left early in the morning and came back with this huge golden retriever. I recognized him immediately. It was Buster, Jake's dog. Jake love that dog more than anything. When his grandpa died last year, Buster was the only thing that helped him through it. I asked Chloe why she had Buster and she got this weird smile on her face. She said Jake didn't deserve to keep him since he broke her heart. Then she said something that made my stomach drop. She told me she was going to take Buster to the vet tomorrow to put him down as payback for what Jake did to her. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. This dog was completely healthy and happy, just confused about being in a new place. Buster kept looking around for Jake and whining by the door. It was heartbreaking. I told Chloe she was being insane and she couldn't just kill someone's dog because she was upset. She laughed and said Jake should have thought about that before he decided to hurt her. Then she said if I told anyone, she'd make sure I regretted it. That night I couldn't sleep, kept thinking about Buster and how scared he must be. Around 2:00am, I heard Chloe on the phone with someone probably making the vet appointment. I knew I had to do something.

Mom, dad, and my brother. Landon Harper's got that new job, dad was saying. Making good money now. We'll just tell her it's for Mom's surgery. Mom nodded. She gave us 12,000 for the roof last year, no questions asked. My stomach dropped. There was no roof repair. I'd seen the receipts myself. They'd used my money for Landon's gambling debts. How much this time? Mom asked. 50,000, Landon said casually, maybe 60 if we play it right. Tell her the cancer came back. Cancer? They were going to fake cancer to steal from me. I backed away slowly, my mind racing. The cancer scare from two years ago, the one that made me liquidate my retirement fund to pay for experimental. Had that been fake, too? I thought about all the times I'd helped. A car accident that wasn't covered by insurance. Landon's business that needed startup capital. Mom's dental work, Dad's back surgery. $57,000 over five years. All because I thought I was being a good daughter. Every family gathering, they raised me for being so generous. Behind my back, they were laughing at how easy I was to manipulate. I got in my Car and drove straight to the bank. I'd like to close all my accounts, I told the teller. All of them. Miss every single one. And I need cashiers checks for the full amount. documentation of every transaction I've made to these three people over the past five years. That evening, Landon called, right on schedule. Hey, sis, can you come over tomorrow? Mom has some news about her health. His voice had that practiced concern, the same tone he'd used for every fake emergency. Sure, I said sweetly. I'll bring the whole family something special. I spent that night making copies of everything. Bank statements, medical records I'd helped to pay for. Receipts from Landon's failed ventures. Five years of financial manipulation, all documented.

The man was gunned down in front of his wife and daughter. And instead of taking a second to acknowledge how horrifying that is, people are online making memes and throwing around cheap punch lines like his life was entertaining. He wasn't just a political figure on a stage. He was a husband and a father. And his daughter literally watched her dad collapse in front of her. Imagine being that kid one day, scrolling online and seeing thousands of strangers laughing about the worst moment of your life. You don't have to agree with his politics. You don't have to support anything he stood for. But celebrating a man's murder in front of his family isn't some clever protest. It's cruelty. Everyone talks about empathy and compassion until it's someone they disagree with. Then suddenly all that moral high ground disappears and death becomes a punchline. That's not justice. That's just heartlessness disguised as politics. Snoopy.

So I showed her what life looks like when I stop owing her love, effort, and commitment. We've been married eight years. Eight years of working overtime for our house, down payment, canceling plans when she needed me home, spending weekends fixing things to make her life easier. I thought I was being considerate, spirit, offering to set aside work and distractions to focus on us instead of appreciation. I got a sharp, dismissive response. Her tone was cold, almost rehearsed. I don't owe you intimacy, she said, arms crossed, eyes locked on me like she was daring me to challenge her. At first I thought I'd misheard. What does that even mean? I asked, half laughing, half nervous. She didn't flinch. It means exactly what it sounds like. I'm tired of you acting like it's some kind of obligation. Just because we're married doesn't mean I owe you anything. I felt like the ground had been ripped out from under me. Eight years of sacrifices and working myself to exhaustion, and now she was telling me my feelings and needs didn't matter. That the foundation of our marriage, trust in timidity partnership, was apparently optional. The fight didn't last much longer. She walked out, leaving me standing there with my thoughts racing. By morning, my frustration had turned into resolve. If she didn't owe me intimacy, then maybe I didn't owe her the endless sacrifices I've been making.

My friend Katie always had something to say about my face. Every time we hung out, she'd make these little comments like you'd look so much better with just some mascara or I have lipstick that would really help you out. I kept brushing it off because we've been friends since middle school and I figured she meant well. But then came her engagement party last month. I showed up in a nice dress, hair done, feeling good about myself. Katie took one look at me and said, oh, honey, you really should have told me you weren't doing makeup. I would have brought my kit. She said it loud enough for everyone to hear, including her fiance's family, who I was meeting for the first time. I felt my face turn red. Her mom even chimed in saying, Katie's right, dear. A little color would really brighten you up. I spent the whole night feeling like everyone was staring at my bare face. Katie kept introducing me as her natural friend with this fake sweet smile. That night I texted my sister about it. She was furious and said Katie was being a total jerk. Then she offered to do my makeup for the wedding since she works at Sephora. I told her no at first because I didn't want to be petty. But she convinced me that looking good wasn't About Katie. It was about me feeling confident. So two weeks before the wedding, my sister and I went shopping. We got everything, foundation, concealer, eyeshadow, palettes, the works. She taught me how to do a full glam look that made my eyes pop and my skin look flawless. We practiced three times until I could do it myself. Morning of Katie's wedding, I woke up at 6:00am to start getting ready. I did my makeup exactly like my sister taught me, then put on this stunning blue dress I've been saving for a special occasion. When I looked in the mirror, I barely recognized myself. I looked amazing. I got to the church early and found my seat.

My husband's friend Kate always had to be the main character in every situation. When someone else had good news, Kate suddenly had better news. At group dinners, she'd hijack any conversation within five minutes. I couldn't stand her, but I put up with it because she and Zach had been friends since college. After my husband and I announced our pregnancy at 12 weeks, things with Kate got really weird. Suddenly, Kate was everywhere we went sporting a small baby bump. She showed up at our favorite brunch spot rubbing her belly. She enrolled in our exact prenatal yoga class. She even switched to our OB practice. Nobody questioned it because these things happen, and women get pregnant at the same time, she posted weekly bump photos on Instagram, and everyone congratulated her just like they did me. Three months in, one of our friends mentioned something strange at a girl's night. She said Kate's belly looked bigger the previous Tuesday at book club than it did at Saturday's barbecue. When she brought it up, Kate burst into tears about how cruel it was to comment on a pregnant woman's body. She went on about water retention and bloating and how pregnant women deal with enough judgment without their friends piling on. Our friend felt terrible and apologized foolishly while the rest of us comforted Kate. After that night, nobody dared mention anything about her appearance again, even though I started noticing her bump size seemed to fluctuate, too. That's when things got uncomfortable. Kate started making comments about how wild it was that we got pregnant around the same time. She'd joke about our babies being best friends, or maybe even more than friends someday. Then the jokes got stranger, like when she said pregnancy Brain made her forget exactly when she conceived and wasn't it funny how close our due dates were? She started showing up at every single appointment Zach and I had, always in the waiting room when we arrived, claiming her appointment was right before or after hours. During our maternity photo shoot at the park, she appeared with her own photographer, saying what a coincidence that she booked the same spot. The photographer later told me Kate had called asking what time we'd be there. Everything exploded at my baby shower. My. My sister threw this beautiful garden party with all our family and friends there to celebrate. Halfway through opening gifts, Kate stood up and clinked her glass to make an announcement. With tears streaming down her face, she placed her hand on her belly and said, I have the most wonderful news to share with everyone. Zack and I are having a baby together! The entire party gasped, and she continued with a huge smile, I know this is unconventional, but isn't it beautiful that our babies will be siblings?

I need something scary, not basic and cute. Like bro, how about if I wanna be Iron Man? You're gonna suggest me a plain red T-shirt and call it a day? Like, where's the creativity? Did it just ran away? I remember back then there was costume makeup and a lot of creativity is put into it. But this year is just plain shirt and Jean. Like bro, you ain't giving out outfit ideas, you're giving out what to wear on a regular day. Like bro, when Halloween comes, I better see someone with a costume that is just perfection, not a plain shirt and jeans or at least use makeup. Damn it, did we just enter an era where we turn cute instead of being scary or act like a psychopath so you can get candy? Like, come on, I better not see anyone using this basic idea or I'm going to start questioning about our creativity.

Logan had been complaining for weeks that I hovered too much. When we went out at his company's holiday party, he pulled me aside near the coat check. Listen. Tonight, can you just not be so attached to me? My coworkers think it's weird how you're always by my side. Just mingle on your own. For once, I smiled sweetly. Of course, babe, I'll give you tons of space. Really? You're not upset? Not at all. You want independence at parties? You got it. The party was at this upscale rooftop venue, open bar, DJ, the Works. Logan immediately ditched me to bro out with his work buddies, leaving me by the entrance. Perfect. I walked straight to the bar where his boss, Thomas, was getting drinks. Emily, where's Logan? Oh, he wanted space. Tonight, I'm flying solo. Thomas looked confused at his own company party. He says I'm too clingy, didn't want me cramping his style. Thomas's wife, Diane overheard. He left you alone. How rude. No worries. I'll just entertain myself. And I did. I ended up in a fascinating conversation with the CFO about cryptocurrency. Then the head of HR pulled me into their group to settle a debate about true crime podcasts. I was having a genuinely great time. An hour in, I caught Logan's eye across the room. He was with his bros but kept glancing over As I laughed with his supervisors, then the DJ started playing salsa music. This gorgeous guy from accounting, Javier, asked if I could dance. I'd love to. We tore up that dance floor. Turns out Javier was a semi professional dancer. He spun me, dipped me the whole nine yards. Proud form to watch. Logan appeared suddenly. Hey, maybe we should, oh, am I being too clingy? I asked mid spin. No, I just, great. Then you won't mind if I keep dancing. Javier dipped me dramatically. The crowd cheered. Logan retreated to the bar Downing whiskey with his confused buddies. Later, the CEO's wife pulled me aside. You're Logan's girlfriend. We need to talk. She dragged me to her table full of executives wives. They immediately adopted me, pouring champagne and gossiping about everyone. Logan usually brags about you non stop. One said, where is he? He needed guy time. Apparently I hover. They exchanged looks. Men are idiots, the CEO's wife declared, raising her glass. Toasted to that. Logan kept trying to approach, but every time he got close, someone else would pull me into conversation. His female co workers wanted workout tips. The it guys needed restaurant recommendations. Even the janitor asked for relationship advice. Everyone loved me except Logan who looked increasingly miserable. Then came the speeches. CEO grabbed the mic thanking everyone for their hard work. Special shout out to Emily for bringing such amazing energy tonight. Logan, you're a lucky man. Everyone clapped looking Around for Logan. He was sulking by the bathroom. Where's Logan? The CEO asked into the mic. He wanted space. So when yelled laughter erupted, the CEO's wife grabbed the mic. Well, his loss. Emily's been the life of the party. More cheering. Logan's face went red. Around midnight, the party was winding down. I was.

My dad comes storming in like I just committed murder. Watch your language, young lady. I don't want to hear that garbage coming out of your mouth again. I just stared at him. This is the same guy who stubbed his toe yesterday and yelled son of a bitch, bastard, piece of shit table loud enough for the neighbors to hear. But somehow me saying shit once is crossing the line. Are you serious right now, dad? Dead serious. You're better than that. That's when I got the idea. If you wanted to please my language, fine. But fair is fair. Okay, dad, you're right. Swearing is bad. So let's all stop starting now. Anyone who swears in this house pays $5 into a jar. Family swear tax. He laughed like it was a joke. Sure, honey, whatever makes you happy. I grabbed an empty pickle jar from the recycling and Wrote swear jar on it with a Sharpie, put it right on the kitchen counter where everyone could see it. Day one was amazing. Dad walks into the kitchen that morning, sees the coffee pot is empty.

Every Thursday for three years, I told my wife Becca the same thing. I'm going to hang with the boys tonight. Be back around midnight. Truth is, I was driving to the cinema to watch movies alone because I just needed some me time. But then two months ago, my movie ended abruptly and I came home two hours earlier than planned. When I turned onto our street, there was a black Infinity in our driveway. My heart stopped as I watched back all the footage from our doorbell camera and saw a man getting out of the car and walk. Hang up like he done it before. Becca opened. Before he could ring, they kissed. The kind where her hand went to his neck. My stomach dropped. I wanted to burst through that door and confront them, but I decided on the spot that that would be too kind. Needed to do something else. Something that would destroy her. So I drove around until 12:30 and walked in with a story about Tony getting drunk. Becca was showering. Hey, babe. How was your night? Good. You know how it is. Next two Thursdays, I kept my routine, but park down the street at 8:30 to watch. At the same time, the same car pulled up. I zoomed in on the ring footage, and that's when it hit me. The man was Mark. Mark, who supposedly moved to Seattle two years Ago, my knees were shaking, but I took screenshots and sent them to my lawyer to further build my case. When I was confident enough that I had everything basically set up, I dropped the bomb. Becca was going on about her fake plans for when I left for Boys Night, when I randomly blurted out, you know who I miss? Mark. That guy and I used to have so much fun before he moved to Seattle. Her fork stopped halfway to her mouth just for a second. Yeah, Mark was great. You guys still text, though, right? Sometimes. The next morning, she woke up different, with this nervous energy. She made some phone calls behind closed doors. And since it was Thursday, during lunch, she texted, what time are you heading out tonight? She never asked before, so I knew. The comment about Mark got her. Probably 7:30. Why? Just wondering. The guys doing anything special? Same old. After work. She was cooking in full makeup. You look nice, I said. Just felt like making an effort for you to come home to. But she kept checking her phone and setting it down, then picking it back up. At 7:15, she practically. He pushed me out. Don't want you to be late. Tell everyone I say hi. I drove to my regular spot down the street where I watched them, but this time, there was no car that showed up. And at nine fifteen, becca's own car pulled out. I followed her. First stop, o'malley's sports bar, where she thought i'd be. She walked in confidently, then came out five minutes later looking confused, checking her phone, scanning the parking lot. Then she got back in her car. Her second stop, the dugout, another sports bar. Through the windows, I watched her walk the entire place, moving table to table, even checking the bathroom entrance area. She showed her phone to a waitress, who shrugged. Back to the car, more frantic phone checking. Third stop, Buffalo Wild Wings. She stayed longer this time, 15 minutes. I could see her at the bar talking to the manager, showing him something on her phone, probably my picture. He shook his head, pointed to their mostly empty tables. Thursday wasn't exactly Prime Sports Bar night. Fourth stop, the dive bar where Tony actually used to drag us. She went straight to the bartender. I slipped in through the side door, ducked into the hallway by the bathrooms, heard her say, every Thursday night, group of guys, probably five or six of them, loud. One of them looks like this. The bartender studied her phone. Thursday is our slowest night. I definitely remember a regular group. Sorry. She left looking frustrated, sat in her car for five minutes typing furiously. Then she drove to the AMC theater. I gave her a 10 minute head start, then walk in through the side entrance. She was at the concession stand talking to the teenage manager. Showed her phone again. He pointed toward the theaters. She went to check each one, opening doors, scanning the sparse Thursday night crowds. I went back to my car. Twenty minutes later, she emerged, looking defeated. Sat in her car for another 10 minutes. Through her rear window, I could see her on the phone, gesturing with her free hand. Probably calling Mark. Probably saying she couldn't find me anywhere. That maybe I knew that Thursday nights might not be safe anymore. She even drove by two more bar on the way home. Quick stops, desperate checks. When I got home at my usual time, she was on the couch with. As always. Yeah. Where exactly did you guys go? Oh, Malley's. Why? Her jaw clenched. No reason. Just curious. Was it busy? Pretty dead, actually. Who all was there? Haven't heard their names in a while. The usual.

She returned 6 years later to find I divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years Max. Change the locks. She left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation to our 8 year olds. That first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decision missions. No more walking on eggshells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curve ball our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year 2 brought unexpected changes without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I've been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd forgotten how to Enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partner ship could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught sky to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her Bonus Mom, their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes and tucked them in at night. Year 5 was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. Their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year 6, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward after three years. Of zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp in the living room. Through the window, we watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck, pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she owned the place. Eleanor was packing the twins lunches for.

Ask around. Nobody has ever. Three, raw eggs are mostly fine for you. It's not impossible, but you're highly unlikely to get salmonella from eating them. The reason you shouldn't eat raw cookie dough is the raw flour, which is actually dangerous, not the raw eggs. Four, paper wasps. They're incredibly docile. Every year they build a nest above my back door. Even if there's dozens of them swarming around, they won't bother you if you don't bother them. They're fascinating creatures to observe. You can actually feed them by hand by dipping your finger in syrup, honey or anything sugary. They'll lick it right off. Five years of coexisting with them and I have yet to get stung. Plus, having their nest over the door deters burglars. 5, nuclear power, the safest energy source humanity has ever known. Fun nuclear fact, if you swam near the surface of a nuclear containment pool with actual glowing radioactive spent fuel rods in the bottom, you would receive less radiation than if you just stood out in the sun. 6, not that I would know, but apparently and scientifically, taking LSD in a reasonable dose and many other psychedelics, it is almost no risk for physical or mental addiction harm, according to Medical and psychological studies. On the other hand, there are a lot of potential benefits regarding mental health, especially if you compare it with legal stuff like cigarettes or alcohol, which are both one of the most harmful substances in existence. But most people think psychedelics are on the same level as real hard stuff such as meth or heroin just because they only classify in legal and illegal. This is no advice, just my opinion based on a ton of research. 7, eating food that's a bit past the sell by date. 8, msg. And it's so good. Put that on your eggs.

What is wrong with September? It's only been 11 days and the world is completely off its fucking rocker. Charlie Kirk was killed in front of his family. David was found with a body in his car. A Ukrainian girl was stabbed on the subway. And now Elon Musk isn't even the richest man on the planet anymore. Like, can we chill for one second? First, Charlie Kirk got shot during a speech in Utah. He was literally in front of his wife and kids when a bullet entered his artery through his neck. The scene was so bloody and gruesome, it's insane. A Ukrainian girl gets stabbed on a train in Charlotte. She escaped a literal war, came here to be safe and still got killed because this planet has zero peace. Then D4D has a whole body in his car, like not a metaphorical one, an actual human body in a bag in his trunk. And this dude just casually performed like he didn't have a horror movie in his backseat. What the hell? And even outside all of that, Elon Musk is no longer the richest person in the world, losing his top spot to a rival tech CEO, showing how unstable everything feels right now, even at the highest levels. It's like every time I open my phone, reality speed runs another tragedy. Like, bro, it's been 11 days. September just started. I thought my only problem this month would be math class, but no, apparently It's full blown world collapse. Society isn't just cooked, it's burnt to ash.

I was halfway through Saturday morning spin at Cycle Soul Clenching to keep my tampon inside of me when I noticed the blonde girl in front of me facetiming my boyfriend of four years. Can't wait to see you tonight, beautiful, he whispered. I vomited in my mouth. I can't believe we've been dating for three months already. She responded like, hello, Britney. Our instructor who always wore the cutest sets saw me crying and immediately cut her playlist. Hey, hon, are you doing okay? That's my man. I pointed at the screen where Blake was now shirtless making breakfast. The entire studio went silent, 25 girls in coordinating workout sets just staring. The blonde girl immediately hung up and turned around. Wait, girl, I'm so sorry. I swear I didn't know. Every single girl started climbing off their bikes. Someone handed me a liquid IV. Someone else had tissues, the good ones with lotion. Another girl was already fixing my mascara with her emergency makeup kit. Four years, Natalie shrieked. This absolute trash man has been with her for four years. The blonde Isabella looked like she was gonna throw up her green juice. I met him on Bumble and he said he just got out of something casual. Casual. The entire room erupted. They found his Instagram and followed in seconds. The most recent photo was literally a picture of us holding hands by the beach with the caption L O m L this absolute queen with sleeve tattoos and perfect and liner just said call his sister speaker now my hands were shaking as I found Ellie's contact. She spoke first hey babe how's been? Did you try that new protein smoothie place? After Ellie my voice voice cracked Blake's facetiming another girl they've been together for three months the silence was louder than when a boy starts showing you his camera roll on the first date girl, don't play are you being effing for real right now? I turned on Facetime and showed myself crying my eyes out and that's when she started shouting I'm getting my mom and we're coming right now don't effing move she hung up and I just stared at my phone like okay, Ellie kind of ate oh, this is about to be good someone whispered Isabella and I were clutching each other's hands neither of us blaming each other the entire class was hyping me up and telling me I deserve better teenager in the corner came up to me and said girl even while crying your skin is glowing let that crusty man go back to picking girls who are actually in his league the class leader Bethany shouted your hot girl era starts now now even the quiet girl said girl you were really gonna give that receding hairline your best years that one made me laugh and y'all when that door flew open it was like Real Housewives Met Crazy Rich Asians. Ellie strutted in with her Balenciaga bag. Mrs. A. Leek in her Saturday costar fit but make it fashion. Her Aunt Linda, who I didn't even know was coming, had her Cartier sunglasses on indoors. Where is she? Mrs. Leek's voice could have cut diamonds. She saw me, saw Isabella. I watched her perfectly microbladed brows go through the five stages of grief in real time. Ellie, call your brother now, mom. Maybe we should now. The way Ellie's acrylics clicked on her phone screen was aggressive. What? Blake's annoyed voice came through the speaker. Get your butt down to cycle soul.

So I did exactly that and watched her world crumble. She watched me get down on one knee five times and said no every single time. Eight years together, I've been playing husband since year two, paying her car note, keeping her on my insurance, covering most of the rent while she found herself through three different careers. She had this whole routine down, tears in her eyes, hand on her heart, then some perfectly rehearsed excuse, we're not ready. Let's wait till we're more stable. Timing isn't right. Then came proposal No. 5, and she finally showed me who she really was. I'd gone all out this time, convinced myself that maybe the problem was I hadn't made it special enough. I rented out her favorite restaurants, rooftop, hung string lights everywhere and invited all our friends and family there. The whole production cost me three months salary, but I thought it'd be worth it when she finally said yes. My girlfriend stood there in the dress I'd bought her, surrounded by everyone we knew, and she didn't even let me finish the speech, just shook her head with this pitying smile like I was a dog that wouldn't stop bringing her the same stick. Back at our apartment that night, I finally broke, asked her straight up if she loved me. Why did she keep doing this? Her whole face changed in an instant and the mask came. Completely off. It's my choice when I accept a proposal, she said. Voice ice cold. You don't get to pressure me with your timeline. You're my boyfriend, so act like one. Stop trying to be my husband when I haven't even accepted your proposal. Know your place. No, my place. After eight years of building a life together, I was supposed to know my place. Those words rewired something in my brain. Eight years of playing husband while she kept me a boyfriend status because it was convenient for her. She wanted me to act like a boyfriend. Fine. I give her exactly what she asked for. But boyfriends don't pay their girlfriends bills. Boyfriends don't share bank accounts. Boyfriends don't sacrifice their futures for someone who won't even wear their ring. I started my new boyfriend only poly see the next morning while she was at her yoga class. First, I sold the ring to a dealer for 12 grand, enough to cover what I spent on her car this year alone. Then I called Verizon and removed her from my phone plan. By the time she got home from yoga, I changed every password and moved my money from our joint account. She didn't even notice until lunch when her phone died mid phone call. Babe, my phone's not working, she texted from her laptop, annoyed but not worried. Call Verizon. It's being weird. An hour later, they said I'm not on the account anymore. Then the panic. Started creeping in. What did you do? I responded, I'm being your boyfriend and not your husband, just like you said. She actually laughed at first, thinking it was some kind of joke. She came home that night acting extra sweet. Made my favorite dinner and tried to cuddle on the couch. Okay, you made your point, she said. Kissing my neck. I'll think about what you said. Now fix my phone. I moved to the guest bedroom instead. The next morning, she couldn't log into Netflix. Then Hulu died.

When I turned 15, my mom went from strict to straight up paranoid. One night after dinner, she plopped down next to me with this weird smile and said she was installing a family safety app on my phone. I watched her tap away, giving herself access to everything. My location, photos, texts, even my drafts on social media. It's just to keep you safe, honey, she said, handing my phone back like nothing had changed. But everything had changed. It felt like having a stalker who lived in my house. At first I tried to be cool about it. Maybe it would calm her down, right? Wrong. Things got insane fast. She text me in the middle of conversations asking who I was with. Comment on memes I haven't even posted yet because she was reading my drafts. The worst part? She started replying to my friends pretending to be me. My buddy Jake texted asking if I wanted to hang out, and my mom replied, sure. Sure thing, buddy! With way too many exclamation points. Jake called me laughing, asking why I was texting like a soccer mom. I had no idea what he meant until I checked my messages. Then came the day that broke me. I was in history class when Mrs. Wilson pulled me aside. Looked uncomfortable as hell. Liam, your mother called the school. She's concerned about some message you sent about Me. My stomach dropped. I knew exactly what she meant. I texted my best friend Kyle the night before, joking about how our history teacher's haircut looked like she stuck her finger in an electrical socket. It was just good friend stuff, not meant for anyone else. But my mom had read it and called the school to complain about my private joke. I wanted to disappear into the floor. By lunch, Kyle wasn't talking to me. Neither was Jake. Word got around that my mom was reading everything, and suddenly nobody wanted to text me anymore. Some kids even blocked me. It was like my social life had a disease. And the disease was my mom. That night, I stared at my phone, feeling trapped. But then I noticed something. The tracking app worked both ways. It log every time someone access the account. I spent hours studying those logs, and what I found made my skin crawl. My mom wasn't just checking my phone during the day. She was logging in 1 a m, 2 a m, even 3 a m. She was forwarding my messages to her laptop. She was screenshotting my photos. She was living inside my phone 24 7. So I came up with a plan. I created a fake friend named Daniel, made up this whole persona, gave him a backstory. Even found some random photos online to use as his profile pic on a group chat with myself.

Logan had been complaining for weeks that I hovered too much. When we went out at his company's holiday party, he pulled me aside near the coat check. Listen. Tonight, can you just not be so attached to me? My coworkers think it's weird how you're always by my side. Just mingle on your own. For once, I smiled sweetly. Of course, babe, I'll give you tons of space. Really? You're not upset? Not at all. You want independence at parties? You got it. The party was at this upscale rooftop venue, open bar, DJ, the Works. Logan immediately ditched me to bro out with his work buddies, leaving me by the entrance. Perfect. I walked straight to the bar where his boss, Thomas, was getting drinks. Emily, where's Logan? Oh, he wanted space. Tonight, I'm flying solo. Thomas looked confused at his own company party. He says I'm too clingy, didn't want me cramping his style. Thomas's wife, Diane overheard. He left you alone. How rude. No worries. I'll just entertain myself. And I did. I ended up in a fascinating conversation with the CFO about cryptocurrency. Then the head of HR pulled me into their group to settle a debate about true crime podcasts. I was having a genuinely great time. An hour in, I caught Logan's eye across the room. He was with his bros but kept glancing over As I laughed with his supervisors, then the DJ started playing salsa music. This gorgeous guy from accounting, Javier, asked if I could dance. I'd love to. We tore up that dance floor. Turns out Javier was a semi professional dancer. He spun me, dipped me the whole nine yards. Proud form to watch. Logan appeared suddenly. Hey, maybe we should, oh, am I being too clingy? I asked mid spin. No, I just, great. Then you won't mind if I keep dancing. Javier dipped me dramatically. The crowd cheered. Logan retreated to the bar Downing whiskey with his confused buddies. Later, the CEO's wife pulled me aside. You're Logan's girlfriend. We need to talk. She dragged me to her table full of executives wives. They immediately adopted me, pouring champagne and gossiping about everyone. Logan usually brags about you non stop. One said, where is he? He needed guy time. Apparently I hover. They exchanged looks. Men are idiots, the CEO's wife declared, raising her glass. Toasted to that. Logan kept trying to approach, but every time he got close, someone else would pull me into conversation. His female co workers wanted workout tips. The it guys needed restaurant recommendations. Even the janitor asked for relationship advice. Everyone loved me except Logan who looked increasingly miserable. Then came the speeches. CEO grabbed the mic thanking everyone for their hard work. Special shout out to Emily for bringing such amazing energy tonight. Logan, you're a lucky man. Everyone clapped looking Around for Logan. He was sulking by the bathroom. Where's Logan? The CEO asked into the mic. He wanted space. So when yelled laughter erupted, the CEO's wife grabbed the mic. Well, his loss. Emily's been the life of the party. More cheering. Logan's face went red. Around midnight, the party was winding down. I was.

It started at Thanksgiving when my cousin wouldn't shut up about me being single. She kept asking why I never brought anyone home, making these fake concerned faces at the dinner table. So when she said, I must be dating someone special, I just nodded, gave him a name right on the spot. Daniel said he was busy with work. My family ate it up. But then Christmas rolled around and my mom started asking when she could meet Daniel. My aunt kept texting about setting an extra place at dinner. I was stuck. That's when my roommate Becca suggested her coworker, Daniel, who owed her big time for covering his shifts. She showed me his Instagram, tall brown hair, actually decent looking. He agreed to one dinner as a favor. The problem, he didn't just show up and fake smile through dinner. He brought flowers for my mom, asked my dad about his woodworking hobby and somehow knew my grandmother collected vintage tea cups because I'd mentioned it once when building the fake story. He even laughed at my little brother's terrible jokes about robots. My family was obsessed. After that first dinner, my mom kept inviting him back, Easter brunch, my cousin's graduation party, random Sunday dinners. Daniel never said no. He text me beforehand asking what to bring, if anyone had allergies, stuff like that. He started sending my brother updates about basketball. Scores. My dad asked him to help fix our back porch. The worst part was how natural it felt. We drive to my parents house together and he'd ask about my day like we actually dated. He remembered my coffee order, knew I hated mushrooms, would grab my jacket when I got cold. During family game night, he'd automatically pick me as his partner. We had inside jokes that weren't even planned. One night after my aunt's birthday party, we sat in his car outside my apartment in complete silence. Everyone had spent the whole night saying how perfect we looked together, how lucky I was. My grandmother even pulled me aside to say Daniel was a keeper. Whole car ride home, I kept stealing glances at him, wondering what he was thinking. I started rehearsing speeches in my bathroom mirror, practice bringing it up casually over coffee. But every time I opened my mouth, nothing came out. How do you tell someone you caught feelings for a fake relationship? Everything changed at Christmas dinner. My aunt announced she'd been looking at wedding venues for us and she found the perfect place for next fall. Daniel laughed it off perfectly, made some joke about her getting ahead of herself. But later that night, he texted me, we can't keep this up forever. You know, that message hit me like a truck. I realized he was ready to end this whole thing and I wasn't, not even close. Instead of texting Back or giving him some weird speech. I invited him over for dinner at my place, cooked his favorite pasta dish, the one my mom always made when he came over, set the table with actual candles, not just the overhead light. After we finished eating, I was washing dishes and he was drying them, just like we did at my parents house. That's when I finally said it. I know this.

She returned 6 years later to find I divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years Max. Don't change the locks. He left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation to our 8 year olds. That first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decisions. No more walking on eggs shells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curve ball in our backyard hard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year 2 brought unexpected changes without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I'd been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd Forgotten how to enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her Bonus Mom, their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes and tuck them in at night. Year 5 was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year 6, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward. After three years of zero contact, court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from the living room. Through the window, we watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck, pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she owned the plate.

I responded, bros before hoes, but moms before all. And everyone cracked up. Jason didn't smile, though. His face drained of color like I just confessed to murder. He grabbed all his stuff and moved 3 rows up the school bus without a word. Jason, what's wrong? I was just kidding. I called after him, but he wouldn't turn around. That's when I heard it. Casey, my girlfriend's best friend, was crying her eyes out in the back row. When I turned to look, her friend whispered urgently in her ear and she glanced at me before crying harder. Okay, that was definitely weird. I started to wonder whether my joke was really that offensive. That's when my phone buzzed. Three missed calls from dad, but there was no signal. And at the red light, I caught the bus driver wiping his eyes in the rearview mirror. In my three years of knowing him, the most emotion he'd shown was mild annoyance when kids left trash on the seats. A cold feeling crept into my stomach. I got up to go talk to Jason, but missus unfit Harris blocked the aisle. Sit down. We're moving. I just need to sit down. I'd never heard her voice like that. I sat. But the second we got to the destination, I cornered Jason. Dude, what is going on? He backed away. Nothing. I just, I need space, bro. I was just kidding. I don't know if I'd pick my mom or my girlfriend. Why did you have to tell everyone what I said? Sid appeared out of nowhere and pulled me aside. Our team captain who never said more than pass the ball to me, grabbed my shoulders. Bro, if you need to talk about anything, I'm here. About what? I was almost shouting now. He just squeezed my shoulder and walked away. That cold feeling in my stomach was spreading. During the water break, Ryan shuffled over. This kid didn't even know my name. Oh, the blonde Kaylee from volleyball thinks you're cute. She's single now, too. The words hit like a punch. Dude, what the hell? I flashed him my lock screen. I have a girlfriend. His face went white. Just trying to help you move forward, man. Move forward. From what he. I practically ran away. I tried calling my girlfriend Isabella on the public landline right then straight to voicemail. I must have called 15 times. I was losing my mind. Everyone felt so bad for me that no one even forced me back on the field to play. As soon as lunch hit, I grabbed Jason more aggressively this time. Tell me what's happening now. Now I can't. He was typing frantically in his notes app. You can't or you won't. His girlfriend Ava read over his shoulder, then slapped him hard. How Could you not tell him, you coward? She stormed off. Jason did something happened to Isabella. He wouldn't look at me, just kept typing. That's when Stacy walked by. She saw me and her face twisted with rage. You never deserved a girl like you, Isabella. I always told her she deserved better. Her friend clamped a hand over her mouth and dragged her away. My head was spinning. I stumbled to the vending machines where the coaches were arguing. He has a right to know now, Missus Griffin hissed. There's no point. The decision has already been made, Missus Fitzharris shot back. Somebody tell me what's happening, I shouted. They scattered like roaches. It wasn't until the bus ride back that Jason spoke to me again. By that point, I was so sick of everyone's BS. That I just wanted to show him the Minecraft base I've been working on.

Like, no big fall out, no drama. Just slowly stop talking, stop checking in, stop being us. And you sit there wondering when it happened. Like, what was the moment? What did I miss? How did we go from daily convos and inside jokes to seen and silence? And the worst part. I still care. I still see stuff and think they'd laugh at this. Or I wish I could tell them this. But I don't. Cause now it feel weird. Sad how people become strangers with memories. I can reach out, I can say something. But deep down I know if they wanted to talk to me, they would have. And I'm tired of always being the one holding the glue. So I just sit with it, act like I'm over it. Pretend like losing people I never thought I'd lose is normal now. Whatever.

There has been a school shooting in Denver. A girl got stabbed on the subway and no one helped her. A decomposing body found in D4V D's car. A man was beheaded at Dallas motel. Charlie Kirk getting shot and killed at a university. And all on top of that, the 9 11 was 24 years ago today. As much as I hate Charlie Kirk and his decisions, no one deserves to get killed. Imagine what his wife and kids are feeling right now. His children can't grow up with their dad. His wife is now a single parent. I genuinely hate Charlie, but I can't imagine how his family is handling this right now. And apparently they witnessed it. The way the blood came out of his neck was genuinely traumatizing. The way his body went limp immediately was horrifying. But anyways, moving on to the D4 V D situation. He's been on tour for like what, a month now? He hasn't been in LA for like a month. And the body hadn't decomposed enough for it to be in that car for so long. The body was in there for three days, and the police haven't even made him a suspect. And plus he had a concert like yesterday, I'm pretty sure. But yeah, moving on to the girl that was stabbed. She was literally minding her business before she got stabbed. And as soon as she got stabbed, everyone was So calm. Like, hello, she needs help. There was literal blood dripping on the floor. I don't have much information on the other situations, but the fact that this is all happened in a week is honestly scary. Like, this month has just started. What's going on

It started when my sister Chloe came home crying because her boyfriend Jake dumped her. She's 25 and I'm 17, but she always acts like she's the victim in every situation. This time was different, though. She kept saying Jake was horrible and cruel. But when I asked what happened, she got all shifty. He said he broke up with her out of nowhere and kicked her out of his apartment. But then she mentioned she still had keys to his place because she forgot to give them back the next day. She left early in the morning and came back with this huge golden retriever. I recognized him immediately. It was Buster, Jake's dog. Jake love that dog more than anything. When his grandpa died last year, Buster was the only thing that helped him through it. I asked Chloe why she had Buster and she got this weird smile on her face. She said Jake didn't deserve to keep him since he broke her heart. Then she said something that made my stomach drop. She told me she was going to take Buster to the vet tomorrow to put him down as payback for what Jake did to her. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. This dog was completely healthy and happy, just confused about being in a new place. Buster kept looking around for Jake and whining by the door. It was heartbreaking. I told Chloe she was being insane and she couldn't just kill someone's dog because she was upset. She laughed and said Jake should have thought about that before he decided to hurt her. Then she said if I told anyone, she'd make sure I regretted it. That night I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about Buster and how scared he must be. Around 2:00am, I heard Chloe on the phone with someone probably making the vet appointment. I knew I had to do something. Then next morning, Chloe left for work and told mom she was taking Buster for a walk later. Mom didn't know the whole story. Chloe just said Jake asked her to watch his dog for a few days. As soon as both then were gone, I called Jake. He picked up on the first ring and sounded terrible. I told him Chloe had Buster and was planning to put him down today. He went completely silent for like 10 seconds, then started freaking out. He said he'd been looking everywhere for Buster and thought maybe he got out somehow. I told Jake to come over now while Chloe was at work. He was at our house in 15 minutes. When he saw Buster, he literally started crying. Buster went crazy with excitement, jumping all over him and licking his face. I opened the door and Jake carried his dog out to his car. Before he left, Jake told me what really happened with Chloe. She Didn't just get dumped. She cheated on him with his best friend, Marcus. When Jake found out, he broke up with her and told her to move out. She stole Buster on her way out and left Jake's spare key on the counter so he thought she was being mature about the breakup. A few hours later, Chloe came home and went straight to look for Buster when she couldn't find him. She started screaming my name. She found me in my room and absolutely lost it. She called me a traitor and said I had no right to interfere in her business. Then mom came home and asked what all the yelling was about. Chloe told her I let some guy steal her dog. She made it sound like I just gave away her pet to a random stranger. Mom looked.

So I did exactly that and watched her world crumble. She watched me get down on one knee five times and said no every single time. Eight years together, I've been playing husband since year two, paying her car note, keeping her on my insurance, covering most of the rent while she found herself through three different careers. She had this whole routine down, tears in her eyes, hand on her heart, then some perfectly rehearsed excuse, we're not ready. Let's wait till we're more stable. Timing isn't right. Then came proposal No. 5, and she finally showed me who she really was. I'd gone all out this time, convinced myself that maybe the problem was I hadn't made it special enough. I rented out her favorite restaurants, rooftop, hung string lights everywhere and invited all our friends and family there. The whole production cost me three months salary, but I thought it'd be worth it when she finally said yes. My girlfriend stood there in the dress I'd bought her, surrounded by everyone we knew, and she didn't even let me finish the speech, just shook her head with this pitying smile like I was a dog that wouldn't stop bringing her the same stick. Back at our apartment that night, I finally broke, asked her straight up if she loved me. Why did she keep doing this? Her whole face changed in an instant and the mask came. Completely off. It's my choice when I accept a proposal, she said. Voice ice cold. You don't get to pressure me with your timeline. You're my boyfriend, so act like one. Stop trying to be my husband when I haven't even accepted your proposal. Know your place. No, my place. After eight years of building a life together, I was supposed to know my place. Those words rewired something in my brain. Eight years of playing husband while she kept me a boyfriend status because it was convenient for her. She wanted me to act like a boyfriend. Fine. I give her exactly what she asked for. But boyfriends don't pay their girlfriends bills. Boyfriends don't share bank accounts. Boyfriends don't sacrifice their futures for someone who won't even wear their ring. I started my new boyfriend only poly see the next morning while she was at her yoga class. First, I sold the ring to a dealer for 12 grand, enough to cover what I spent on her car this year alone. Then I called Verizon and removed her from my phone plan. By the time she got home from yoga, I changed every password and moved my money from our joint account. She didn't even notice until lunch when her phone died mid phone call. Babe, my phone's not working, she texted from her laptop, annoyed but not worried. Call Verizon. It's being weird. An hour later, they said I'm not on the account anymore. Then the panic. Started creeping in. What did you do? I responded, I'm being your boyfriend and not your husband, just like you said. She actually laughed at first, thinking it was some kind of joke. She came home that night acting extra sweet. Made my favorite dinner and tried to cuddle on the couch. Okay, you made your point, she said. Kissing my neck. I'll think about what you said. Now fix my phone. I moved to the guest bedroom instead. The next morning, she couldn't log into Netflix. Then Hulu died.

It was 2:00am on a Tuesday and I had work in the morning. But this kid next door had been screaming for three straight hours. Not just normal baby crying, but these gut wrenching wails that made my skin crawl. I tried putting pillows over my head, closing all my windows, even playing loud music through my headphones. Nothing worked. Never met my neighbours properly. They'd moved in about six months ago. This young couple with a baby. The guy seemed okay, always nodded when he saw me getting my mail. The woman looked exhausted every time I saw her, which honestly didn't seem that weird since new parents always look like zombies. But this crying was different. It wasn't stopping and it was getting worse. Around 2:00am, I heard what sounded like furniture being moved around violently. Then a woman's voice shouting something I couldn't make out. That's when I started getting worried. I walked to my window that faced their apartment and tried to see what was going on. Their blinds were mostly closed. I could see shadows moving around frantically. The baby was still screaming, but now it sounded muffled, like someone had closed a door or something. I debated for like 20 minutes whether to call the cops. I mean, what if it was nothing? What if they were just having a rough night and I was being that annoying neighbour Who calls the police over everything? But something felt really wrong. The way the woman had screamed, the furniture noises. Now the baby sounded different, more desperate. So I called 9 1 1. The operator asked me what my emergency was, and I felt stupid saying it, but I told her I thought something might be wrong next door because a baby had been crying for hours and I heard what sounded like a fight. She said they'd send someone to do a welfare check. I figured they'd knock on the door, see that everything was fine, and I'd probably never make eye contact with my neighbors again out of embarrassment.

It started at Thanksgiving when my cousin wouldn't shut up about me being single. She kept asking why I never brought anyone home, making these fake concerned faces at the dinner table. So when she said I must be dating someone special, I just nodded, gave him a name right on the spot. Daniel said he was busy with work. My family ate it up. But then Christmas rolled around, and my mom started asking when she could meet Daniel. My aunt kept texting about setting an extra place at dinner. I was stuck. That's when my roommate Becca suggested her coworker Daniel, who owed her big time for covering his shifts. He showed me his Instagram. Tall, brown hair, actually decent looking. He agreed to one dinner as a favor. The problem? He didn't just show up and fake smile through dinner. He brought flowers for my mom, asked my dad about his woodworking hobby, and somehow knew my grandmother collected vintage tea cups because I'd mentioned it once when building the fake story. He even laughed at my little brother's terrible jokes about robots. My family was obsessed after that first dinner. My mom kept inviting him back. Easter brunch, my cousin's graduation party, random Sunday dinners. Daniel never said no. He text me beforehand, asking what to bring, if anyone had allergies, stuff like that. He started sending my brother updates about basketball scores. My Dad asked him to help fix our back porch. The worst part was how natural it felt. We drive to my parents house together and he'd ask about my day like we actually dated. He remembered my coffee order, knew I hated mushrooms, would grab my jacket when I got cold. During family game night, he'd automatically pick me as his partner. We had inside jokes that weren't even planned. One night, after my aunt's birthday party, we sat in his car outside my apartment in complete silence. Everyone had spent the whole night saying how perfect we looked together, how lucky I was. My grandmother even pulled me aside to say Daniel was a keeper. Whole car ride home, I kept stealing glances at him, wondering what he was thinking. I started rehearsing speeches in my bathroom mirror, practice bringing it up casually over coffee. But every time I opened my mouth, nothing came out. How do you tell someone you caught feelings for a fake relationship? Everything changed at Christmas dinner. My aunt announced she'd been looking at wedding venues for us, that she found the perfect place for next fall. Daniel laughed it off perfectly, made some joke about her getting ahead of herself. But later that night, he texted me. We can't keep this up forever, you know? That message hit me like a truck. I realized he was ready to end this whole thing. And I wasn't. Not even close. Instead of texting back or Giving him some weird speech. I invited him over for dinner at my place. Cooked his favorite pasta dish. The one my mom always made. When he came over the table with actual candles, not just the overhead light. After we finished eating, I was washing dishes and he was drying them. Just like we did at my parents house. That's when I finally said it. I know this.

What did your daughter's boyfriend do that forever changed how you saw him as a cop? I hated the idea of my 17 year old daughter dating anyone. But when she brought home this boy named Pete, I lost it. He had a motorcycle, tattoos, and that smug smile that made me want to run his name through the system. I made it my mission to break them up. I'd randomly show up at places they hung out, flash my badge around, and remind Pete that I knew how to make bodies disappear. But this kid never flinched. He'd just smile and say, have a good day, sir. When he came for dinner the first time, I placed my gun on the table next to my plate. My wife kicked me under the table, but I didn't care. Pete just looked at it and said, Nice Glock 19, sir. My uncle's got the same one at his security firm. That's when the real torture began. I started making him come over every weekend to bond. I'd have him help me with the most backbreaking chores I could think of. Reshingling the roof in July, digging out a tree stump by hand, moving every piece of furniture in the house to steam clean the carpets. This kid never complained. He'd show up at 7:00am sharp, already wearing work clothes. Even brought his own work gloves. When I try to wear him down with endless tasks, he'd just say, what's next, Sir, one Saturday. Hey. I had him helping me rebuild the deck. I was being extra harsh, making him redo boards that were perfectly fine. Around noon, my daughter brought us water. As she walked away, I caught Pete watching her. But it wasn't the way most teenage boys looked at girls. He had this soft smile, like he was watching something precious. I decided to test him. You know she's way out of your league, right? He wiped his forehead and said, oh, I know, sir. Trust me. I know. That's why I'm here every weekend, letting you test me. Because she's worth it. I was about to respond when we heard screaming from inside the house. We both ran in to find my wife on the kitchen floor. She'd

It started at Thanksgiving when my cousin wouldn't shut up about me being single. She kept asking why I never brought anyone home, making these fake concerned faces at the dinner table. So when she said I must be dating someone special, I just nodded, gave him a name right on the spot. Daniel said he was busy with work. My family ate it up. But then Christmas rolled around and my mom started asking when she could meet Daniel. My aunt kept texting about setting an extra place at dinner. I was stuck. That's when my roommate Becca suggested her coworker, Daniel, who owed her big time for covering his shifts. He showed me his Instagram, tall brown hair, actually decent looking. He agreed to one dinner as a favor. The problem, he didn't just show up and fake smile through dinner. He brought flowers for my mom, asked my dad about his woodworking hobby and somehow knew my grandmother collected vintage tea cups because I'd mentioned it once when building the fake story. He even laughed at my little brother's terrible jokes about robots. My family was obsessed. After that first dinner, my mom kept inviting him back, Easter brunch, my cousin's graduation party, random Sunday dinners. Daniel never said no. He text me beforehand asking what to bring, if anyone had allergies, stuff like that. He started sending my brother updates about basketball scores, my Dad asked him to help fix our back porch. The worst part was how natural it felt. We drive to my parents house together and he'd ask about my day like we actually dated. He remembered my coffee order, knew I hated mushrooms, would grab my jacket when I got cold. During family game night, he'd automatically pick me as his partner. We had inside jokes that weren't even planned. One night after my aunt's birthday party, we sat in his car outside my apartment in complete silence. Everyone had spent the whole night saying how perfect we looked together, how lucky I was. My grandmother even pulled me aside to say Daniel was a keeper. Whole car ride home, I kept stealing glances at him, wondering what he was thinking. I started rehearsing speeches in my bathroom mirror practice bringing it up casually over coffee. But every time I opened my mouth, nothing came out. How do you tell someone you caught feelings for a fake relationship? Everything changed at Christmas dinner. My aunt announced she'd been looking at wedding venues for us, that she found the perfect place for next fall. Daniel laughed it off perfectly, made some joke about her getting ahead of herself. But later that night, he texted me, we can't keep this up forever. You know, that message hit me like a truck. I realized he was ready to end this whole thing and I wasn't, not even close. Instead of texting back or Giving him some weird speech. I invited him over for dinner at my place, cooked his favorite pasta dish, the one my mom always made when he came over the table with actual candles, not just the overhead light. After we finished eating, I was washing dishes and he was drying them, just like we did at my parents house. That's when I finally said it. I know this.

It was 2:00am on a Tuesday and I had work in the morning. But this kid next door had been screaming for three straight hours. Not just normal baby crying, but these gut wrenching wails that made my skin crawl. I tried putting pillows over my head, closing all my windows, even playing loud music through my headphones. Nothing worked. Never met my neighbours properly. They'd moved in about six months ago. This young couple with a baby. The guy seemed okay, always nodded when he saw me getting my mail. The woman looked exhausted every time I saw her, which honestly didn't seem that weird since new parents always look like zombies. But this crying was different. It wasn't stopping and it was getting worse. Around 2:00am, I heard what sounded like furniture being moved around violently. Then a woman's voice shouting something I couldn't make out. That's when I started getting worried. I walked to my window that faced their apartment and tried to see what was going on. Their blinds were mostly closed. I could see shadows moving around frantically. The baby was still screaming, but now it sounded muffled, like someone had closed a door or something. I debated for like 20 minutes whether to call the cops. I mean, what if it was nothing? What if they were just having a rough night and I was being that annoying neighbour Who calls the police over everything? But something felt really wrong. The way the woman had screamed, the furniture noises. Now the baby sounded different, more desperate. So I called 9 1 1. The operator asked me what my emergency was, and I felt stupid saying it, but I told her I thought something might be wrong next door because a baby had been crying for hours and I heard what sounded like a fight. She said they'd send someone to do a welfare check. I figured they'd knock on the door, see that everything was fine, and I'd probably never make eye contact with my neighbors again out of embarrassment.

I'm gonna be honest though, if ice cream trucks are actually being used to kidnap these children, I mean, it's just natural fucking selection at this point. I mean, we are in the big 2025. I mean, who in their right fucking mind is still going up to ice Cream trucks, especially at night time. It's like, come on, buddy, is your fucking brain located in your fucking ass? I will say, though, I was driving to my friend's house the other night, and I saw a suspicious ice cream truck on the way there, and, you know, I didn't. I didn't really think anything of it. Then on the drive home around 10 p m, I saw another, and I still didn't really think anything of it.

She returned 6 years later to find I divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years Max. Don't change the locks. He left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation to our 8 year olds. That first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decisions. No more walking on eggs shells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curve ball in our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year 2 brought unexpected changes without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I've been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd forgotten How to enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake cookies and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her Bonus Mom, their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes and tuck them in at night. Year 5 was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year 6, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward after Three years of zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from the living room. Through the window, we watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck, pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she owned the plate.

Logan had been complaining for weeks that I hovered too much. When we went out at his company's holiday party, he pulled me aside near the coat check. Listen. Tonight, can you just not be so attached to me? My coworkers think it's weird how you're always by my side. Just mingle on your own. For once, I smiled sweetly. Of course, babe, I'll give you tons of space. Really? You're not upset? Not at all. You want independence at parties? You got it. The party was at this upscale rooftop venue, open bar, DJ, the Works. Logan immediately ditched me to bro out with his work buddies, leaving me by the entrance. Perfect. I walked straight to the bar where his boss, Thomas, was getting drinks. Emily, where's Logan? Oh, he wanted space. Tonight, I'm flying solo. Thomas looked confused at his own company party. He says I'm too clingy, didn't want me cramping his style. Thomas's wife, Diane overheard. He left you alone. How rude. No worries. I'll just entertain myself. And I did. I ended up in a fascinating conversation with the CFO about cryptocurrency. Then the head of HR pulled me into their group to settle a debate about true crime podcasts. I was having a genuinely great time. An hour in, I caught Logan's eye across the room. He was with his bros but kept glancing over As I laughed with his supervisors, then the DJ started playing salsa music. This gorgeous guy from accounting, Javier, asked if I could dance. I'd love to. We tore up that dance floor. Turns out Javier was a semi professional dancer. He spun me, dipped me the whole nine yards. Proud form to watch. Logan appeared suddenly. Hey, maybe we should, oh, am I being too clingy? I asked mid spin. No, I just, great. Then you won't mind if I keep dancing. Javier dipped me dramatically. The crowd cheered. Logan retreated to the bar Downing whiskey with his confused buddies. Later, the CEO's wife pulled me aside. You're Logan's girlfriend. We need to talk. She dragged me to her table full of executives wives. They immediately adopted me, pouring champagne and gossiping about everyone. Logan usually brags about you non stop. One said, where is he? He needed guy time. Apparently I hover. They exchanged looks. Men are idiots, the CEO's wife declared, raising her glass. Toasted to that. Logan kept trying to approach, but every time he got close, someone else would pull me into conversation. His female co workers wanted workout tips. The it guys needed restaurant recommendations. Even the janitor asked for relationship advice. Everyone loved me except Logan who looked increasingly miserable. Then came the speeches. CEO grabbed the mic thanking everyone for their hard work. Special shout out to Emily for bringing such amazing energy tonight. Logan, you're a lucky man. Everyone clapped looking Around for Logan. He was sulking by the bathroom. Where's Logan? The CEO asked into the mic. He wanted space. So when yelled laughter erupted, the CEO's wife grabbed the mic. Well, his loss. Emily's been the life of the party. More cheering. Logan's face went red. Around midnight, the party was winding down. I was.

It started when my sister Chloe came home crying because her boyfriend Jake dumped her. She's 25 and I'm 17, but she always acts like she's the victim in every situation. This time was different, though. She kept saying Jake was horrible and cruel. But when I asked what happened, she got all shifty. She said he broke up with her out of nowhere and kicked her out of his apartment. But then she mentioned she still had keys to his place because she forgot to give them back. The next day, she left early in the morning and came back with this huge golden retriever. I recognized him immediately. It was Buster, Jake's dog. Jake love that dog more than anything. When his grandpa died last year, Buster was the only thing that helped him through it. I asked Chloe why she had Buster, and she got this weird smile on her face. She said Jake didn't deserve to keep him since he broke her heart. Then she said something that made my stomach drop. She told me she was going to take Buster to the vet tomorrow to put him down as payback for what Jake did to her. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. This dog was completely healthy and happy, just confused about being in a new place. Buster kept looking around for Jake and whining by the door. It was heartbreaking. I told Chloe she was being insane and she couldn't just kill someone's dog because she was upset. She laughed and said Jake should have thought about that before he decided to hurt her. Then she said if I told anyone, she'd make sure I regretted it. That night I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about Buster and how scared he must be. Around 2 a. M. I heard Chloe on the phone with someone, probably making the vet appointment. I knew I had to do something. Then next morning, Chloe left for work and told mom she was taking Buster for a walk later. Mom didn't know the whole story. Chloe just said Jake asked her to watch his dog for a few days. As soon as both of them were gone, I called. Jake picked up on the first ring and sounded terrible. I told him Chloe had Buster and was planning to put him down today. He went completely silent for like 10 seconds then started freaking out. He said he'd been looking everywhere for Buster and thought maybe he got out somehow. I told Jake to come over now while Chloe was at work. He was at our house in 15 minutes. When he saw Buster, he literally started crying. Buster went crazy with excitement, jumping all over him and licking his face. I opened the door and Jake carried his dog out to his car. Before he left, Jake told me what really happened with Chloe. She didn't just get dumped. She cheated on him with his best friend, Marcus. When Jake found out, he broke up with her and told her to move out. She stole Buster on her way out and left Jake's spare key on the counter so he thought she was being mature about the breakup. A few hours later, Chloe came home and went straight to look for Buster. When she couldn't find him, she started screaming my name. She found me in my room and absolutely lost it. He called me a traitor and said I had no right to interfere in her business. Then mom came home and asked what all the yelling was about. Chloe told her I let some guy steal her dog. She made it sound like I just gave away her pet to a random stranger. Mom looked.

At least with 21 we knew it was from that dumb little vine. With 6 7 they just pulled a number out their ass and made it a lifestyle. Like I swear I'll be in class and the teacher will be like who wants to read the next paragraph? And Dylan all the way in the back just yells out 6 7 and the whole room dies like Kevin Hart just walked in. Meanwhile I'm questioning if I need to go back to kindergarten and relearn math. And the worst part? It's contagious. You start hating it, but after hearing it all day you catch yourself doing it too. At this point I'm convinced 6 7 doesn't mean a damn thing. It's just TikTok brain rot at its peak. You dumbasses could have picked any number, but now y'all went with 6 7 and now we're all stuck living in the 6 7 cinematic universe.

I giggled nervously. Um, yeah. Why? No, no, no, no, no, she said. I screamed while walking as far away from me as possible. I just laughed because moms can be so weird sometimes. But the next day, my daughter came home from school crying. Mommy! Leah said her mom said she can't talk to me anymore. Leah was her best friend. I immediately took out my phone and texted her mom, asking if everything was okay. No response. I texted Emily's mom, one of the other girls in her trio. Still nothing. I had just managed to calm my baby girl down when the pizza arrived. Usually our delivery guy is the Apatron 5,000. But tonight he just set the box on my doorstep and practically ran away. George, you forgot your tip! I yelled, waving a 20. He just kept going. The next few days were insane. At my daughter's soccer practice, Helen saw me walking towards her and held her phone to her ear. No one had even called her, Helen, what's going on? She mouth sorry and walked fast. We used to complain about our husbands together. Parents were whispering and showing each other something on their phones when I walked by. They quickly put them away. By Thursday, my daughter was refusing to go to school. They moved my desk away from everyone else. The teacher said it was for space reasons, but there's like 10 feet between me and Leah now. I tried to bring her to the hairdresser to cheer her up, but when the woman saw me coming, she closed early. No apology? Just flipped the sign and pulled the blinds. My phone buzzed. It was my landlord. Heard what happened. So sorry. Rent can wait this month. This was the same man who charged me a 50 dollar inconvenience fee when I paid rent at 12:00am instead of midnight. Then the birthday party. Emily's sleepover. My daughter found out that everyone was invited except her. She was having such a bad panic attack that I had to call a hospital. Mom, what did I do? Emily is my best friend. Enough was enough. I called the school office. Something is happening to my daughter. She's being systematically excluded, and I need answers right now. The counselor called back within an hour, but her voice was off, like she was choosing every word carefully. Mrs. Cal, a hand. We just wanted to check in about your home environment. Is everything safe? Anyone new spending time around your daughter? What? What are you even asking me? I think it's best if we discuss this in person. Can you come in tomorrow morning? No. You'll tell me right now why my daughter is being tortured. Long pause. The principal will explain everything tomorrow. Beep. She hung up. Then at 11 p m, an Email from my gym membership terminated effective immediately. I've been going there for five years. The owner knew me by name. I was trying to figure out what to do when my daughter crawled into my bed at 2:00am, sobbing, Mommy, am I ugly? It took everything in me not to burst into tears. The lunch lady wouldn't look at me today. She just pointed at my tray. I finally caved. On Saturday morning, I found myself walking towards the principal's office while being escorted by a security guard. Other parents there for Saturday sports hold their kids against the walls as we passed. One mom literally shielded her son with her body, like we were dangerous. In his office, the principal locked the door behind us. The click was so loud in the silence, he walked to the windows and twisted the blinds shut. My daughter grabbed my hand tighter. Please sit down. I'll stand. What is this about? He sat at his desk, fingers hovering over his keyboard, then pulled them back. Mr. Griffin, you're scaring me. Mrs. Callahan, he was looking at his screen, not at me. When did you last speak to your ex husband? Christmas. Why? And you haven't been in contact since then? No communication at all? No. We exchanged texts about

September just got even crazier. So it turns out that Charlie Kirk's shooter has just been identified. Life was found on Mars. Nepal actually burn down their government and the Epstein files just got released. Just days ago. Charlie Kirk was shot and killed during a speech at Utah Valley University. The shooter, 22 year old Tyler Robinson has already been identified and arrested. It turns out that his own dad turned him into the police after finding out what a disturbing thing his son has done and he's now facing many charges. Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, Nepal has erupted. Weeks of youth LED protests over corruption and broken promises turned into full blown chaos. Government buildings were torched. The prime minister was forced to resign and the one piece flag was even hung as a symbol of hope. And while all of that was happening, Mars quietly entered the conversation. NASA's rover has detected possible bio signatures, signs that there might have once been ancient life on the planet. It's the closest we've ever come to extraterrestrial life. At the same time, over 33,000 pages of the Jeffrey Epstein files were released to the public. Thousands of names and connections that people are still coming through with some of the world's most powerful figures being linked to him. It's only been 12 days and it already feels like the whole world balance is shifting.

She returned 6 years later to find I divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years Max. Change the locks. She left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation to our 8 year olds. That first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decision missions. No more walking on eggshells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curve ball our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year 2 brought unexpected changes without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I've been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd forgotten how to Enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partner ship could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught sky to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her Bonus Mom, their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes and tucked them in at night. Year 5 was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. Their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year 6, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward after three years. Of zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp in the living room. Through the window, we watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck, pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she owned the place. Eleanor was packing the twins lunches for.

A decomposing body was found in the back of David's car? This dude was carrying TikTok in 2022 with in the back of My Mind song, but now he's too busy carrying dead bodies. Apparently, the car had been towed a couple days prior, but after a couple days, the residents started complaining that one of their cars had almost like a fishy Gucci type of smell. So they opened up the trunk of one of the cars that was a Tesla that was under the name of David. And David, you should know lions don't do drills inside of Teslas, bro. They're not good at keeping smell. And they have cameras, bro. You can at least have wrap the body up better, bro. I would know. Before the car was impounded, it was abandoned on Hollywood Boulevard for about 5 days, not stolen like everybody thinks it is. So I know this might hurt to hear. It might hit y'all in the heart, but David might have just committed romantic homicide. Apparently, Bro's on tour, but it's only a matter of time before bro gets tackled on stage like Ray Rice did his wife and gets taken to jail. Speaking to the police department, though, please don't arrest David, Bro. We need his songs for invincible Season 4. Bro. This is more important than the Body, Gang. This is more important, bro. I need good music on that season 4.

Logan had been complaining for weeks that I hovered too much. When we went out at his company's holiday party, he pulled me aside near the coat check. Listen, tonight can you just not be so attached to me? My coworkers think it's weird how you're always by my side. Just mingle on your own for once. I smiled sweetly. Of course, babe. I'll give you tons of space. Really? You're not upset? Not at all. You want independence at parties? You got it. The party was at this upscale rooftop venue. Open bar, DJ, The Works. Logan immediately ditched me to bro out with his work buddies, leaving me by the entrance. Perfect. I walked straight to the bar where his boss, Thomas, was getting drinks. Emily, where's Logan? Oh, he wanted space tonight. I'm flying solo. Thomas looked confused. At his own company party. He says I'm too clingy. Didn't want me cramping his style. Thomas's wife, Diane, overheard. He left you alone? How rude. No worries. I'll just entertain myself. And I did. I ended up in a fascinating conversation with the CFO about cryptocurrency. Then the head of HR pulled me into their group to settle a debate about true crime podcasts. I was having a genuinely great time. An hour in, I caught Logan's eye across the room. He was with his bros, but kept glancing over. As I laughed with his supervisors, then the DJ started playing salsa music. This gorgeous guy from accounting, Javier, asked if I could dance. Love to. We tore up that dance floor. Turns out Javier was a semi professional dancer. He spun me, dipped me, the whole nine yards. A crowd formed to watch. Logan appeared suddenly. Hey, maybe we should. Oh, am I being too clingy? I asked mid spin. No, I just. Great. Then you won't mind if I keep dancing. Javier dipped me dramatically. The crowd cheered. Logan retreated to the bar, Downing whiskey with his confused buddies. Later, the CEO's wife pulled me aside. You're Logan's girlfriend? We need to talk. She dragged me to her table full of executives wives. They immediately adopted me, pouring champagne and gossiping about everyone. Logan usually brags about you non stop. One said, where is he? He needed guy time. Apparently. I hover. They exchanged looks. Men are idiots, the CEO's wife declared, raising her glass. Toasted to that. Logan kept trying to approach, but every time he got close, someone else would pull me into conversation. His female co workers wanted workout tips. The IT guys needed restaurant recommendations. Even the janitor asked for relationship advice. Everyone loved me except Logan, who looked increasingly miserable. Then came the speeches. CEO grabbed the mic, thanking everyone for their hard work. Special shout out to Emily for bringing such amazing energy tonight. Logan, you're a lucky man. Everyone clapped, looking Around for Logan. He was sulking by the bathroom. Where's Logan? The CEO asked into the mic. He wanted space. So when yelled, laughter erupted. The CEO's wife grabbed the mic. Well, his loss. Emily's been the life of the party. More cheering. Logan's face went red. Around midnight, the party was winding down. I was

I have no sympathy for him, to be honest. I do feel bad for his kids and everyone that had the witness to what happened firsthand. But I rather spare my feelings and empathy towards the Colorado high school victims which happened on the same day or the countless families and Gaza that have been destroyed. Now, am I celebrating or happy about what happened? Absolutely not because it's terrible. I do not endorse political violence. And Charlie unfortunately became a victim to gun violence which thousands of people in the US have become a part of. I disagree with everything Charlie stood for, his views, beliefs, and I do believe that his influence has indirectly caused harm against people, mainly minorities and already targeted groups. But once again, I'd like to reiterate what happened to him is unacceptable. I am all for stricter gun control policies and some of you may disagree and say otherwise. Just like Charlie Kirk, I think it's worth to have a cost of unfortunately some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the 2nd Amendment to protect our other god given rights. I think what happened will only add to the growing hatred between the two political parties. I'm fearful for the people of this country because with each year it seems like we become more and more divided when right now it should be the opposite, the pointing of fingers. And saying, oh, this side is more bad because XYZ isn't what we should be doing. The constant berating the vision is only digging us a deeper hole. We are all entitled to our own opinions, of course. So feel free to comment what you think. And by the way, I made a separate video on this question specifically because most of the other questions are not serious and I don't want to talk about Whimper Audios right after a discussion like this. But yeah, okay. Thank you.

I painted it. I was standing in front of my largest piece at the gallery opening, champagne in hand, when a man in an expensive suit approached and started explaining my own painting to me. He had no idea I was the artist because the placard said Riley Turner, who he clearly assumed was a man since he kept talking about his brilliant technique. This guy, Robert, looked me up and down and said, you seem young to be at an opening like this. Let me guess. Looking for a rich boyfriend, smart girl, lots of wealthy men here. He gestured at my painting like he owned it. See, what Riley is doing here requires years of training to appreciate. You probably just think the colours are pretty. The average woman just sees decoration. I took a sip of champagne and said, interesting perspective, which I guess he took as encouragement. Robert moved closer to the painting, physically stepping in front of me and continued his lecture. A girl like you probably thinks this is just nice to look at, but there's actual intelligence behind it. The artist is obviously a man because women simply don't have this kind of technical mastery. Female painters do flowers and feelings. This has real intellectual depth. It's biological, really. Men are just more capable of this level of abstraction. When I mentioned I was familiar, With the artist's work, Robert laughed and patted my shoulder. Following him on Instagram to look at the pretty pictures doesn't count as being familiar with art, sweetheart. You probably think you're cultured because you went to that Van Gogh light show. Real knowledge comes from decades of study, not whatever you Learned from TikTok. Robert decided to test me, rapid firing questions. Who's Basquiat? What's Kiara Scuro? Name three Renaissance painters besides da Vinci. When I started to answer, he cut me off. Wrong. See, this is why galleries shouldn't have open events. You probably googled some terms before coming here to impress men. But Riley here is working in a tradition you couldn't possibly understand without a proper education. Not community college, real universities. He returned to my painting now explaining it louder to draw a crowd. What Riley has achieved here would cost probably 100,000 in education to even attempt. The materials alone cost more than you'd make in a month at whatever retail job you have. He looked at my outfit with disgust. Target clearance rack, right? Someone who shops there couldn't possibly grasp the investment in this piece. Probably spent more on one brush than your entire outfit. When I suggested the artist might be self taught, Robert sneered at me. Is that how you Learned about art? Painting parties? Robert grabbed my wrist to pull me to another angle. His grip too tight. You're too stupid to even stand in the right spot, Riley. Intended for this to be viewed from. Exactly here. Your ignorance is actually disrespectful to his work. He kept his hand on my wrist while explaining, though.

You can figure it out. She shrugged. I stood there watching her walk away with her perfect little blended family, dragging their matching designer suitcases toward the gate. She didn't even look back. Not once. I had $23 in my pocket, a dead phone charger, and absolutely nowhere to go. Oh, in this massive airport. That's when I remembered. The business card tucked in my wallet. The one with the fancy logo I've been carrying around for three years. My Aunt Sarah's restaurant card. The sister my mom had been bad mouthing my entire life, calling her a jealous failure. Sarah's a pathetic loser, mom always said. She's jealous of our success and belly. Don't believe anything she tells you about our family. But standing there alone in JFK Terminal 4, watching families rush past me with their vacation excitement, I figured I had nothing left to lose. I found a payphone. Yes, I still exist in airports. And dialed the number with shaking fingers. It rang twice before a warm, professional voice answered. Bella Vista restaurant. This is Sarah speaking. Aunt Sarah, it's Maya. I'm in really big trouble right now. The silence lasted forever. Then, in a completely different tone. Baby girl! Maya, where are you? Are you safe? What happened? I started crying. Right there in the middle of the busy Terminal. Mom left me at the airport. She took her new husband and his kids on vacation to Hawaii and just abandoned me here. What terminal are you at? I'm coming to get you right now. You don't understand. I'm at JFK in New York. You're all the way in Chicago. I can't ask you to. Maya, Honey, listen to me carefully. I have three successful restaurants now. I'm not the broke failure your mother told you I was. Exactly where you are. I'm getting on the next available flight. Four hours later, I watched a confident woman in designer jeans and a cashmere coat rush through the arrivals gate, scanning the crowd frantically. She looked exactly like mom, but her eyes were kind instead of cold. When she spotted me, she started running. I've been waiting 10 years for this phone call, she whispered, hugging me so tight I could barely breathe. I've tried reaching you so many times, but your mother blocked every single attempt. To ride to her luxury hotel suite was completely surreal. Sarah explained everything while ordering room service. How she'd built a successful restaurant empire from nothing. How she'd been sending birthday cards and Christmas gifts that mom apparently threw away unopened. How she'd even hired a family lawyer once to try for visitation rights. Her mother told everyone in our family that I was a drug addict who couldn't hold a job. Sarah laughed bitterly. Meanwhile, I've been featured in Chicago magazine as entrepreneur Of the year, two years running. That night in the hotel, Sarah showed me years worth of returned letters with refused photos of elaborate birthday cakes she'd made for me each year and bank statements proving she'd been setting aside money for my college fund since I was born. I'm not letting you go back to that toxic woman, she said firmly. We're calling my lawyer first thing tomorrow morning. The emergency custody hearing was swift and decisive. When the family court judge heard that mom had literally really abandoned a minor at an airport to go on vacation and saw the documented evidence of Sarah's consistent attempts to maintain contact over the years, the decision was immediate. Mom came home from her honeymoon paradise.

A girl got stabbed on the subway and no one helped her. A decomposing body found in D4V D's car. A man was beheaded at Dallas motel. Charlie Kirk getting shot and killed at a university. And all on top of that, the 9 11 was 24 years ago today. As much as I hate Charlie Kirk and his decisions, no one deserves to get killed. Imagine what his wife and kids are feeling right now. His children can't grow up with their dad. His wife is now a single parent. I genuinely hate Charlie, but I can't imagine how his family is handling this right now. And apparently they witnessed it. The way the blood came out of his neck was genuinely traumatizing. The way his body went limp immediately was horrifying. But anyways, moving on to the D4V d situation. He's been on tour for like, what, a month now? He hasn't been in LA for like a month. And the body hadn't decomposed enough for it to be in that car for so long. The body was in there for three days and the police haven't even made him a suspect. And plus, he had a concert like yesterday, I'm pretty sure.

There was literal blood dripping on the floor. I don't have much information on the other situations, but the fact that this is all happened in a week is honestly scary. Like this month has just started. What's going on?

Charlie Kirk was shot in the neck while he was speaking at a Q&A at a college about transgender Pew Pew's. There's a video circulating where the shot rings off, and he's hit right here in the throat, and you can see his body go limp and blood just starts going everywhere. And nobody knows if he is alive, if he's okay, and if he survives, it honestly seems like it's gonna be a miracle. After the shot goes off and he slumps, the crowd just freaks out. Everybody starts running. And there are conflicting reports on whether or not the assailant, the one that attacked Charlie, is in custody or not. Right now, we just don't have a lot of information. And I don't really care what political side you lean on. Nobody deserves to be attacked in this manner. You can look up the footage for yourself. I'm not gonna show it here because that's up to you if you wanna see it or not, but it's absolutely awful. It does not look good. And my thoughts and prayers are with Charlie and his family. None of us here really agree with Charlie's views, but he's still a human being. He has family that cares about him. And this is just awful, and this is not what we should be doing. Let's be really respectful during this time. It doesn't matter if you're red or you're blue. We need to come together because this is Violence, and violence is not okay

Imagine being in Australia right now and seeing people actually protesting to kick out every single immigrant. Like, do they even realise what they're saying? Almost one third of the entire country, which is about 7.5 million people, were born overseas. That's not some small minority you can just brush off. That's a massive chunk of the population. If they were suddenly removed, Australia wouldn't just take a hit, it would spiral into absolute chaos. Let's start with healthcare. Almost 40% of doctors and 30% of nurses in Australia are immigrants. You rip them out and hospitals collapse overnight. Emergency rooms packed with no staff, surgeries delayed for months. Sick people with nowhere to go. Farming, same story. A huge part of agriculture depends on migrant workers. Without them, crops would rot in fields, food shortages would hit immediately and prices would skyrocket. Families wouldn't even be able to afford basic groceries. And let's not pretend the economy would survive. Removing millions of workers would spark mass unemployment, destroy industries and trigger a housing crash that would send shockwaves through every part of society. It's basically national self destruction. And then there's the most delusional part. That one guy shouting, this land was built by white Australians, we wanna send them back! Like, bro, do you even hear yourself? White Australians aren't the original founders of this land. They stole it from Aboriginal people who were here tens of thousands of years. Before colonization. The irony is wild. The people screaming go back are technically the biggest immigrants of them all. If anything, they're the ones who should leave. Because protesting against immigrants in a country built by immigration is not only disrespectful, it's hypocrisy at its peak. End of the day, without immigrants, there is no Australia as we know it.

For months, my son had been begging for a raise in his weekly pocket money from $10 to $20. Since he'd always been responsible with money, I agreed. But then I noticed something strange. He wasn't buying anything new. One Tuesday afternoon, I got off work early and decided to surprise him by picking him up from school. As I pulled up, I spotted him sitting on a bench with a girl. They weren't talking or playing. They were hunched over a notebook. My son moving his fingers as if playing piano keys on the page. He saw me. He quickly said goodbye to the girl and hurried to the car. During the drive home, I casually asked about his friend. That's Olivia, he said. She sits next to me in music class. The next week, I was sorting laundry when I found a crumpled receipt in his jeans pocket, 20 piano lesson with an address I didn't recognize. I was confused. We didn't have a piano and he never mentioned wanting to learn. I decided to follow him after school the next day. He walked to a small music store where an older man greeted him. My son handed over his $20, sat down at a piano and began a lesson. After 30 minutes, he thanked the teacher and left. But instead of heading home, he returned to school. Curious, I followed at a distance and Watched as he met Olivia on the same bench, he opened a notebook and began teaching her everything he'd just Learned that night. I asked him what was going on. After some hesitation, he explained that Olivia loved piano more than anything, but her family couldn't afford lessons. I sat there stunned that my 11 year old had been spending his entire allowance to learn something just so he could teach someone else.

Meanwhile, d a 0 a Studios drop another sequel with the emotional depth of a cereal box and expect praise because the shadows are ray traced. Like cool, your water physics are great. Why do I want to uninstall after 15 minutes? And don't get me started on Nintendo right now. These people are out here selling the same underpowered hardware with a fancy number slapped on it like we don't see the scam. Oh look, it's the switch too. Only for the cheap price of 74 49 kroners and the games are 90 bucks. Nintendo, I love you but I think I'll stick with my Switch Lite and Mario Odyssey. I'm sorry, but I don't care if your console has legacy branding. If I have to duct tape my Joy Cons and pray it runs 30 fps and handheld, you are not winning. Meanwhile, indie devs are making entire masterpieces in RPG Maker or unity with $15 and trauma as their only resources. And it's always them, the Weird, quiet devs who vanish for two years and come back like, hey, I made a 6 hour psychological RPG about grief, identity and childhood trauma. The combat's kind of cool too. And it slaps. No micro transactions, no fake hype, just pure vision and effort. Indie Games Care. Aio Games calculate. One feels like art, the other feels like a Powerpoint.

We fight over the smallest, dumbest, most irrelevant things. Like it's literally part of our friendship contract. Like, bro, we'll drink the last sip of my drink and I'll be like, you're done. We're not friends no more. But five minutes later, we're chilling again like nothing happened. Why? Because the fight wasn't even real. We just argue for fun at this point. And it's always over something stupid. Why are you walking slow? Why do you breathe so loud? Why are you looking at me like that? Like, bro, why are you breathing my air? That's how dumb the arguments get. And don't let it be about food. Food arguments hit different. You said I could have some. I said a bite, not half the plate. Next thing you know, we're standing there like two toddlers fighting over a toy. And we always gotta have the last word too. It's like a competitive sport. He'll say, alright, whatever. I'll hit back with, nah, you whatever. And it just keeps going until someone says something so ridiculous we both just start laughing. Like, bro, we're not normal. Real arguments. Never. But somehow we've fought about who's taller, whose shoes are cleaner, who gets ox and who sat in the front seat last time. Like, bro, we need help. But that's what makes the friendship solid. We fight, we argue, we roast each other for sport. And two minutes Later we're planning what to eat like nothing even happened. That's real friendship. Constant drama over nonsense, but deep down, you know you'd ride for each other anytime.

Last Tuesday, I was making lunch for my kids when my phone rang. Unknown number, but I picked up anyway. Big mistake, right? This guy with a thick accent starts telling me he's from the IRS and I owe $4,200 in back taxes. If I don't pay immediately with gift cards, the police will arrest me within an hour. Now, here's the thing. I literally just got my tax refund two weeks ago. My accountant, Beth, handled everything perfectly, and I even got money back. So I knew this dude was full of it. But instead of hanging up, something clicked in my brain. My neighbor, Mrs. Kim, had fallen for this exact scam last month and lost $800. Time for payback. I started crying into the phone. Oh, no, I can't go to jail. My kids need me. The scammer ate it up. He told me to go to target and buy iTunes gift cards worth $2,000 as a first payment. I said I needed an hour to get the money together. First I called my cousin Jake, who's a cop, told him what was happening, and he said to keep the guy on the line as long as possible. Then I started my revenge tour. I called the scammer back an hour later, sobbing. I'm at target, but I'm so confused. Which gift cards do I buy? He walked me through it step by step. I pretended to be this helpless single Mom who didn't understand technology. Sorry, can you repeat that? My hands are shaking so bad. For the next 20 minutes I wandered around target asking him questions. Do I need the physical cards or the digital ones? Cashier is asking for I. D. Is that normal? Sorry, my 4 year old is having a meltdown in the cart. Finally I told him I had the cards. He was so excited. Probably thinking about his commission. I read him the first number. Okay, it starts with 5. Wait, is that a 5 or an S? The scratching messed it up. I gave him completely fake numbers, mixing up digits, going super slow. After 20 minutes of this he got frustrated. Ma'am, those numbers don't work. Go buy new cards. So I did the whole routine again. Drove to Walmart, called him back crying harder. The first store's cards didn't work. Are you sure you're really from the IRS? This time I really went for it. I'm in the Walmart parking lot fake crying so loud other shoppers were staring. My kids are asking why Mommy is buying $5,000 worth of iTunes cards. My daughter wants to know if we're going to be homeless. The scammer actually tried to comfort me.

Yes, you heard me right. Charlie Kirk, the conservative guy that is pro Trump supporter and the debater got shot and killed at a college campus in Utah. And this is truly sad. I don't really like him, but I woke up to the news about him being dead. Like seriously, I was so confused at first and I found out it was real. He got assassinated. And the thing is that people were celebrating on his death like it's a dictator day. But guys, he is a Trump supporter. Of course, some bad thing were coming out of his mouth. People were celebrating, making jokes about his death. And most disgusting part is that some people post a clip of him getting shot and blood just coming out of neck like it's a fountain. Guys, guys, this guy was a freaking dad. He had a wife, two kids and this assassin was the one who took Charlie away from his wife and kids. And now, let's imagine this for a second. Imagine you're one of the Charlie's kid, you're standing there watching him debating about some gun violence and boom, gunshot. And you're just seeing him slowly dropping dead while a pool of blood coming out of his neck. That is the way to get traumatized forever seeing your father die in front of you. I'm sending my condolences to Kurt's family. And guys, please be respectful in the comments. And let their family have some privacy. Although he has a lot of bad takes as a Trump supporter. But no one deserves to die for having different opinions.

She returned 6 years later to find I divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years Max. Don't change the locks. She left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation to our 8 year olds. That first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parent decisions. No more walking on eggshells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curve ball our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year 2 brought unexpected changes without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I've been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd forgotten how to Enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her Bonus Mom, their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes and tucked them in at night. Year 5 was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. Their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year 6, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward after three years of Zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from the living.

Two women in our accounting department got pregnant at almost the exact same time. Jessica found out first and was super excited, showing everyone her ultrasound photos and talking about baby names during lunch breaks. Three weeks later, Amber announced she was also pregnant, due just two weeks after Jessica. Everyone was thrilled. The whole office was buzzing about having two babies so close together. Both women submitted their maternity leave paperwork right away, since we needed time to arrange coverage for their positions. Jessica went on leave first. When her daughter was born, everything seemed normal. Then Amber went into labour early, about a week before her scheduled leave was supposed to start. That's when things got weird. Our payroll system flagged an error. When I tried to process Amber's leave, it said someone had already filed maternity leave under her name and Social Security number. I figured it was just a computer glitch, so I called our IT department. They pulled up the records and found something impossible. According to our system, Amber had already been on maternity leave for three weeks. But she'd been working the whole time. She was literally at her desk yesterday. I started digging deeper and found the original leave request filed under Amber's name. It had her Social Security number, her employee ID, everything. But the submission date was from a month ago, right when Jessica Had filed hers. Something was seriously wrong here. I pulled the security footage from the day the duplicate paperwork was submitted. At 6:47 p m, after most people had left, Jessica was sitting at Amber's desk, using her computer. She spent 43 minutes there printing documents and filling out forms. But it got worse. Way worse.

Like there is a good reason to hate it. Maybe if we stop calling the most stupidest shit homophobic, you would actually take the real discrimination against us seriously.

I nearly choked on my cereal because that was not a conversation I wanted to have at 8:00am on a Tuesday. It's not what it looks like, I said quickly. But Jake was already scrolling through my transaction history with his eyebrows raised. Really? Because it looks like you're getting paid every Friday for the past three months by someone whose contact name is literally Sugar daddy Mike with money bag emojis. He turned his phone toward me showing the evidence. Are you seriously doing that kind of work? Without telling me, I grabbed my phone back, my face burning red. Jake, I swear to God it's not what you think. Mike is my boss at the pet sitting company. He stared at me like I'd grown a third leg. Your boss pays you through Venmo and you call him Sugar Daddy Mike? I realized how absolutely insane this sounded, but it was the truth. The company payroll system has been broken for months. Mike pays all the employees through Venmo. And I saved his contact as Sugar Daddy Mike as a joke because he's always buying us coffee and treats for the dogs. Jake was not buying this explanation at all. That's the most ridiculous cover story I've ever heard. Look, I'll prove it. I called Mike right there in our kitchen. He answered on the second ring with his Usual cheerful voice. Hey, and you're not scheduled until this afternoon. Everything okay? I put him on speaker. Mike, my boyfriend thinks we're having some kind of inappropriate relationship because of how you pay us and how your name shows up in my phone. Mike burst out laughing. Oh, no, not again. This happened with my daughter's boyfriend last month. He thought she was cheating on him with her sugar daddy Mike. He explained to Jake that his payroll company had been hacked six months ago, so he'd been paying everyone through cash apps. Jake still looked skeptical. But why Sugar Daddy Mike? Mike laughed even harder. Because I spoil my employees and the pets rotten. Free coffee every day, premium dog treats, bonuses for good work. The girls started calling me Sugar Daddy Mike because I'm always buying supplies and treating them like family. He invited Jake to come by the office to meet the team. You can meet the other four dog walkers who probably also have me saved as Sugar Daddy Mike in their phones. I could see Jake starting to believe the story, but he was still embarrassed about jumping to conclusion. This is why you should have just told me you had a job, he muttered. After we hung up with Mike, Jake apologized profusely. I should have just asked you directly instead of making assumptions. But then he got curious about other things. Wait, if you're only making $250 twice a month, how are You paying for all those expensive dinners you've getting delivered? My stomach dropped because I've been hoping he wouldn't notice my Doordash habit. That's a different situation, I said, trying to change the subject. But Jake was already connecting dots. Please tell me you're not actually doing sugar daddy stuff on the side to pay for food. I just waved it off and tried to ignore him for the rest of the day. The next day, I brought Jake to the pet sitting office to meet Mike and prove my story. He was exactly what you'd expect, 50 something guy in dog hair covered clothes who immediately offered us both coffee and dog treats to sample. See, he said to Jake, total sugar daddy behaviour but completely innocent. The other employees confirmed that they all had similar contact names for Mike and that he was basically the most generous boss ever. Last month he paid for my dog's vet Bill when I couldn't afford it, one co worker said. Jake felt terrible for assuming the worst and bought lunch for the whole pet sitting crew as an apology. I watched too much true crime, he explained to Mike. When I I saw those payments, my mind immediately went to the darkest possibility. Mike laughed it off and said it happened more often than you'd think. My wife gets suspicious, looks at the bank when she deposits checks made out to Sugar Daddy, Mike's Pet Care. That night, Jake finally relaxed. Convinced everything was fine. But when I checked my phone before bed, another 500 dollar transfer came in. The message read, good job. He bought every word.

That's it? Two random numbers and suddenly everyone's acting like it's peak comedy. Like this weekend the calendar hits six for Saturday, seven for Sunday and people are losing their minds. Wow, crazy. Never seen numbers before. Someone asks me how old I am, I say 67 and apparently that's the funniest joke of the year. No, it's not clever, it's not deep. It's just two numbers slapped together like a bad group project. And yet somehow my whole feed is flooded with it. TikTok comments. Just a wall of people spamming 67 like they unlocked a cheat code. Bro, you don't look cool, you look cooked. Teachers ask what page we're on and kids scream 6 7 like it's a cult meme. How is this funny? It's literally the definition of cringe. And the worst part, the more I complain, the more people spam it. Like I'll rant for 2 minutes straight and the comments are still just 67 67, 67. At this point if feels less like a meme and more like brain rot. It's everywhere and now I can't even escape it. I'll wake up, check my phone, and first thing I see another 67 meme. My brain is broken. So fine. If you're part of this chaos, prove it. Type 67 in the comments right now. I wanna see the entire comment section cooked beyond repair.

Like it gets so boring. It doesn't even have to be a full on lesbian relationship. I'll happily ship two girlfriends together. I'm so starved for lesbian representation at this point. It's not that I hate straight ships. I just can't care about them. Like why would a man be there? Especially when it's written from the perspective of the girl? Same with gay ships. Yay, queer representation. Love the gays, but Loki, I just can't get invested. There's some exceptions though, like Pure Vanilla x White Lily from Cookie Run and a couple others, but that's it. I wish WLW ships were more normalized. 99% of the time when there's a girl who could end up with either a guy or another girl, the writers always go with the guy, even when the gay dynamic is clearly better. On the same note, I don't care if the girls I'm shipping have only interacted like four times. I love rare pairs most of the time. I also don't even care if the dynamic between the girls is more toxic. I get more joy from shipping girls together. I love you.

But then again, I've seen people say that people who are happy are disgusting. I just don't agree with that. Nobody is going to have empathy for a guy who said he'd force his daughter to give birth to her rapist baby. And how I see it, people are happy because Kirk was somewhat an oppressor who was also friends with an oppressor. And wasn't this the same guy who said that gun deaths were worth it to keep the 2nd amendment? Should he have been killed? No. Do I feel sad? No. Do I feel empathy for him? No. But until then, Jim Jam is out. Hashtag stay gooning.

Like I already adjusted to the time zones. I legit thought I was safe. Nope, I'm suddenly expected to brush my teeth before the sun even knows what's going on. Okay, moving on, let's talk about the cult you guys have labeled school fashion. Why was everyone wearing red and black pajama pants? Was this planned? It was like walking into a Christmas themed asylum. I'm not even gonna hate because I am absolutely dragging my host mom to target to get some so I can blend in with the cult members. Anyway, first thing they gave me was my schedule and then first thing I did was hide in the bathroom because what the fuck do you mean I'm supposed to actually talk to people? Absolutely not. Homeroom teacher was chill though. Shout out to Mr Lincoln for not forcing me to stand up and introduce myself. Fucking legend. Thankfully my host sister was in most of my classes so I just stayed with her and her friends. Now my classes were really easy like I suspected. So to the people who told me school was gonna be Hard yikes that is until I had biology 5th period bro. I did not realize how many science words exist that I don't know in English. They gave me a language helper like a translator. I felt like a fucking idiot. They also messed up my classes again and put me in French class. What am I supposed to do in there? They said it's gonna take a few weeks before I get my classes switched but you know what? I actually kind of get it now. I get why you guys hate French, but I don't even think it's the language's fault. I think your teachers just hate their jobs about lunch. Oh my God, lunch was disgusting. Starting to feel like the chicken was not chicken. How are you people not dying from this? Do you just build immunity over the years like a vaccine but edible also. Why is it so short? 45 minutes? That is not enough. I'm gonna stop here before this turns into a fucking documentary tomorrow I'll give you the tea on the people instead of the school itself. Anyways, I'm done yapping so bye.

One kid's holding a ring light. Where did they get a ring light? We've been in school for two hours. I don't even think the janitor has a ring light. Then you got the acrobats. Some seventh grader decides the handicap stall is now a gymnast. Sticks are real, and they're doing pull UPS on the stall door frame while their friend times them with a stopwatch.

The last one will shock you. His body language gives him away. He sneaks, glances at you, but quickly looks away when you notice. His feet or body are often pointed toward you. He plays with his hands, adjust clothes, taps foot when you're around. TikTok knows someone who has feelings for you, but it's too afraid to tell you it's the second person. When you click share and more. He gets nervous around you. His voice cracks or he stumbles over words. When talking to you, he finds small excuses to be near you. He shows up where you are more often than coincidence allows. He remembers the little things. Comment I hate when and let your keyboard finish the sentence. Even if he doesn't talk much, he notices details about you, like your favourite snack, something you said weeks ago. He pays attention in ways others might overlook. He interacts differently with you than with others. He may be loud and confident with friends, but quiet around you. He engages online more than in person. He texts, comments, or likes your posts, but is quieter face to face. He's more relaxed when there's no direct eye contact. Before the last fact. Please like the video and follow or you might never see me again. His friends know something. They tease him when you're around. They may drop hints or act differently towards you because they know how he Feels

I painted it. I was standing in front of my largest piece at the gallery opening, champagne in hand, when a man in an expensive suit approached and started explaining my own painting to me. He had no idea I was the artist because the placard said Riley Turner, who he clearly assumed was a man since he kept talking about his brilliant technique. This guy, Robert, looked me up and down and said, you seem young to be at an opening like this. Let me guess. Looking for a rich boyfriend, smart girl, lots of wealthy men here. He gestured at my painting like he owned it. See, what Riley is doing here requires years of training to appreciate. You probably just think the colors are pretty. The average woman just sees decoration. I took a sip of champagne and said, interesting perspective, which I guess he took as encouragement. Robert moved closer to the painting, physically stepping in front of me and continued his lecture. A girl like you probably thinks this is just nice to look at, but there's actual intelligence behind it. The artist is obviously a man because women simply don't have this kind of technical mastery. Female painters do flowers and feelings. This has real intellectual depth. It's biological, really. Men are just more capable of this level of abstraction. When I mentioned I was familiar, With the artist's work, Robert laughed and patted my shoulder. Following him on Instagram to look at the pretty pictures doesn't count as being familiar with art, sweetheart. You probably think you're cultured because you went to that Van Gogh light show. Real knowledge comes from decades of study, not whatever you Learned from talk. Robert decided to test me, rapid firing questions. Who's baskiat? What's kiarascuro? Name three Renaissance painters besides da Vinci. When I started to answer, he cut me off. Wrong. See, this is why galleries shouldn't have open events. You probably googled some terms before coming here to impress men. But Riley here is working in a tradition you couldn't possibly understand without a proper education. Not community college, sweetie, real universities. He returned to my painting now explaining it louder to draw a crowd. What Riley has achieved here would cost probably 100,000 in education to even attempt. The materials alone cost more than you'd make in a month at whatever retail job you have. He looked at my outfit with disgust. Target, clearance rack, right? Someone who shops there couldn't possibly grasp the investment in this piece. He probably spent more on one brush than your entire outfit. When I suggested the artist might be self taught, Robert sneered at me. Is that how you Learned about art? Painting parties? Robert grabbed my wrist to pull me to another angle. His grip too tight. You're too stupid to even stand in the right spot. Riley intended for this to be viewed from exactly here. Your ignorance is actually disrespectful to his work. He kept his hand on my wrist while explaining, though honestly, explaining this to you is like teaching calculus to a toddler. You lack the basic foundation to understand any of it. He noticed me trying to pull away and.

It started at Thanksgiving when my cousin wouldn't shut up about me being single. She kept asking why I never brought anyone home, making these fake concerned faces at the dinner table. So when she said, I must be dating someone special, I just nodded, gave him a name right on the spot. Daniel said he was busy with work. My family ate it up. But then Christmas rolled around and my mom started asking when she could meet Daniel. My aunt kept texting about setting an extra place at dinner. I was stuck. That's when my roommate Becca suggested her coworker, Daniel, who owed her big time for covering his shifts. He showed me his Instagram, tall brown hair, actually decent looking. He agreed to one dinner as a favor. The problem, he didn't just show up and fake smile through dinner. He brought flowers for my mom, asked my dad about his woodworking hobby and somehow knew my grandmother collected vintage tea cups because I'd mentioned it once when building the fake story. He even laughed at my little brother's terrible jokes about robots. My family was obsessed. After that first dinner, my mom kept inviting him back, Easter brunch, my cousin's graduation party, random Sunday dinners. Daniel never said no. He text me beforehand asking what to bring, if anyone had allergies, stuff like that. He started sending my brother updates about basketball. Scores. My dad asked him to help fix our back porch. The worst part was how natural it felt. We drive to my parents house together and he'd ask about my day like we actually dated, remembered my coffee order, knew I hated mushrooms, would grab my jacket when I got cold. During family game night, he'd automatically pick me as his partner. We had inside jokes that weren't even planned. One night after my aunt's birthday party, we sat in his car outside my apartment in complete silence. Everyone had spent the whole night saying how perfect we looked together, how lucky I was. My grandmother even pulled me aside to say Daniel was a keeper. The whole car ride home, I kept filling glances at him, wondering what he was thinking. I started rehearsing speeches in my bathroom mirror, practice bringing it up casually over coffee. But every time I opened my mouth, nothing came out. How do you tell someone you caught feelings for a fake relationship? Everything changed at Christmas dinner. My aunt announced she'd been looking at wedding venues for us, that she found the perfect place for next fall. Daniel laughed it off perfectly, made some joke about her getting ahead of herself. But later that night, he texted me, we can't keep this up forever. You know, that message hit me like a truck. I realized he was ready to end this whole thing and I wasn't, not even close. Instead of texting Back or giving him some weird speech. I invited him over for dinner at my place, cooked his favorite pasta dish, the one my mom always made when he came over the table with actual candles, not just the overhead light. After we finished eating, I was washing dishes and he was drying them, just like we did at my parents house. That's when I finally said it. I know this.

He remembered my coffee order, knew I hated mushrooms, would grab my jacket when I got cold. During family game night, he'd automatically pick me as his partner. We had inside jokes that weren't even planned. One night after my aunt's birthday party, we sat in his car outside my apartment in complete silence. Everyone had spent the whole night saying how perfect we looked together, how lucky I was. My grandmother even pulled me aside to say Daniel was a keeper. The whole car ride home, I kept steal blinking glances at him wondering what he was thinking. I started rehearsing speeches in my bathroom mirror, practice bringing it up casually over coffee. But every time I opened my mouth, nothing came out. How do you tell someone you caught feelings for a fake relationship? Everything changed at Christmas dinner. My aunt announced she'd been looking at wedding venues for us, that she found the perfect place for next fall. Daniel laughed it off perfectly, made some joke about her getting ahead of herself. But later that night, he texted me, we can't keep this up forever. You know, that message hit me like a truck. I realized he was ready to end this whole thing and I wasn't, not even close. Instead, Of texting back or giving him some weird speech. I invited him over for dinner at my place, cooked his favorite pasta dish, the one my mom always made when he came over at the table with actual candles, not just the overhead light. After we finished eating, I was washing dishes and he was drying them, just like we did at my parents house. That's when I finally said it. I know this.

Should I tell her? After three months of her girls nights turning into therapy sessions about how marriage was just a trap, I was done fighting. She'd come home at two a m, reeking of wine, telling me about her divorced friends, authentic lives, how they were finally free and living their truth. Last week, she said maybe I should have listened when they warned me about settling down. So I stopped trying. Yesterday, she noticed. You're not fighting for us anymore. If you really loved me, you'd wanna fix this. I looked at her calmly. You want me to fight for our marriage? Yes. Obviously. Okay. I pulled out my phone and called her best friend, Janet. The twice divorced one who'd been coaching her. Hey, Janet, it's James. Quick question. Do you think my wife should stay married to someone she regrets being with? My wife's face went white. That's what I thought. Thanks for the honest advice. I hung up and looked at my wife. Janet says you should definitely leave me. Congratulations. Your advisor just made the decision for you. She started crying. That's not what I wanted. Funny, because three months ago you said Janet's advice was the best thing that ever happened to you. But I wasn't done. I called Crystal. Next one who spends weekends bar hopping, crying about how all men are trash. Crystal. Hey. My wife's been telling me about Your amazing single life. Should she join you? Live that authentic truth with you guys? Talk about through the phone? Crystal's voice got quiet. Well, I mean, maybe you two should work it out. Work it out? But you told her marriage was a prison last Tuesday. At least that's what she came home saying. I put the phone on speaker so my wife could hear Crystal backpedal. I was just venting about my own situation. I didn't mean. Oh, so when you said, dump his ass and live for yourself, you were just venting? Silence. Then I called Debbie, the twice divorced one living with her parents at 35. Debbie, great news. My wife's finally ready to take your advice about leaving me. When can she move in with you and your mom? Move in? I. There's not really room here. But you said independence was worth any sacrifice. My wife was pale, watching her support system crumble in real time. After I hung up, she whispered, they were just trying to help. Debbie's eating cereal for dinner because she can't afford groceries. Crystal hasn't had a second date in two years. Janet's on antidepressants because she's so lonely. You don't understand their situations. I understand perfectly. Three miserable women convinced you to throw away a good marriage so you could be miserable with them. She sat down hard, but they said I deserved better. Better than what? A faithful husband who works two job so you can Go to yoga class. Better than someone who's never lied to you or cheated. The silent stretch. They said marriage kills your soul. Whose soul got killed? Mine. Listening to you repeat your poison every night. Or yours. Because you let strangers reprogram you. She started crying again. I don't know what I want anymore. I do. You want their approval more than my love. You got it. The irony. Her friends are now panicking, realizing they pushed too hard. Janet called later, begging me not to divorce her because she didn't really mean it. Crystal

So I changed the locks, canceled every privilege in my name and told their father pick up was tonight. No one argued. I'm Tom, 35, and I've been married to Lisa for 18 months. She has two kids from her first marriage, Marcus, 17, and Sophia, 15. Their biological father lives about 40 minutes away and sees them maybe twice a month when he feels like showing up. When Lisa and I got together, I genuinely wanted to be the stepdad I never had growing up. My own father walked out when I was 12, so I knew what it felt like to need a father figure. I thought being a good stepdad meant being the yes man, always supportive, always generous, always understanding. New school clothes? Sure, no problem. Concert tickets for Sophia's favorite band, of course. When Marcus wanted the latest gaming setup, I dropped $800 without blinking when he crashed my car last month after staying hang out past curfew. I didn't even make him pay the 500 dollar deductible. But respect, that was a completely different story. It started with small things. You're not our real dad became their go to response whenever I asked them to do basic household tasks. When I'd ask Marcus to take out the trash, he'd say, I only listen to actual parents. When Sophia left dishes piled in the sink for days, she'd shrug and say, my mom didn't tell Me to clean them. Lisa would have talks with them about respect and they'd apologize and behave for maybe a week. Then we'd be right back to the same pattern. The breaking point came last Friday. I decided to leave work early to surprise Lisa with dinner plans for our anniversary weekend. I pulled into the driveway around 3 in the afternoon and immediately knew something was wrong. There were cars I didn't recognize park on our street and I could hear music blasting from inside the house. I walked through my front door to find about 20 teenagers having a full blown party in my living room. Red solo cups everywhere. The coffee table pushed against the wall. Kids I'd never seen before eating food from my kitchen. My house was completely trashed. Broken lamp, mysterious stains on my white couch, empty bottles scattered everywhere. Marcus was in the center of it all, acting like the king of the castle when he saw me. He didn't even look embarrassed, just annoyed that I'd shown up. Party's over, I said loudly. Everyone out now. The music stopped. Kids started grabbing their stuff and heading for the door, but Marcus didn't move. Clean this mess up immediately, I told him once the house was empty. He actually laughed. You can't tell me what to do. You're not my father. This is my house, Marcus. My couch that's ruined. My lamp that's broke. Can no. Sophia interrupted, appearing from the kitchen. It's Mom's house, too. We live here. We only take orders from real family, not from some guy mom married. That's when I noticed something that made my blood run cold. The door to my home office was wide open, and I always kept it locked. I walked over and immediately saw that my safe was open. My emergency cash envelope, the one where I've been saving money for Lisa's surprise birthday trip to Hawaii, was completely empty. $2,000 gone. I turned around slowly. Where's my money? Marcus shrugged with this smug expression. What money? I don't know what you're talking about. $2,000 from my safe. The safe that was locked this morning. Prove we took it, Sophia said with a smile. That made me realize this wasn't just disrespect anymore.

I'm begging you right now because that had me traumatized. I'm grown and people call me UNC and I still can't do blood. The second it started he pouring out like juice. I wanted to tap out bro. That's exactly why I could never be a surgeon or anything medical long term. I don't care what my parents say. Basically he was giving a speech at a university and some old bald sniper just came out of nowhere and actually took him out from like 30 feet away and it's wild because you can disagree with a man, I know I didn't with some things he said and think he said some foul or even racist stuff but at the end of the day he had a wife and two little daughters. You can't wish death on nobody. This division between Republicans and Democrats is gonna spread wide faster than the rift in Superman literally. Watch the presidential debate from 2008 between Obama and some other guy I can't remember. Jokes aside, shit was respectful. Now we got they're eating the dogs and Sleepy Joe memes from the two presidential debates from last year. That sniper got the worst karma coming his Way cause assassinations like this never make sense. You really gonna pull up with a rifle, plan it out and take someone's life when you the dude who's already old shooter should have spent his time in a retirement home or some shit or a warden. Yeah, that unless we're talking about monsters like Epstein, controversial people ain't worth that. I pray that Kirk's family gets through this. May god help America.

She returned 6 years later to find I divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years Max. Don't change the locks. She left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation to our 8 year olds. That first night was brutal. Sky, Taylor kept asking when Mommy was coming home and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decisions. No more walking on eggshells around her moods. Things. Year 1 was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curve ball in our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year 2 brought unexpected changes without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids'grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I've been so focused on fixing my marriage that I've forgotten how To enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor, I only helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught sky to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her Bonus Mom, their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes and tucked them in at night. Year 5 was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year 6, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward after Three years of zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from the living.

He might have not been the best person in the world, but at least he had passion for his speeches and look like a great father. He might have done fucked up shit, but that's normal. I fucked up too. And I'm still here because y'all wanted me to be here. And if you don't got anything nice to say, just don't say it.

When a guy likes you, he'll find ways to touch you, even if it's just a friendly pat on the back or a high five.

That's not defense, that's disrespect. And we're sitting here like, maybe it's peaceful. Well, it's a bit late for peace when we're the ones firing missiles at it immediately. You don't get to throw hands and then act surprised when it looks back. It was just floating there, minding its business. We threw the first punch, it didn't even blink.

My life has been a living hell since they found my channel and it's getting worse every day, all because of one group of girls. Like it started with hate comments and putting pictures in my locker, but the final straw was when they came into school and handed me a T-shirt of my channel asking if I could sign it since I'm so famous. And bro, her friends acted like this was the funniest thing they've ever seen. But I wasn't gonna just let this slide now. So I did some digging and found all their social media channels and saw that they're actually trying to blow up on TikTok themselves, just not with much success. So since they wanna be famous, I'll make them famous by exposing everything they said all in this video, then sending it to their parents, future college, and blowing this video up from millions to see.

For 17 years, I lived with two different fathers. The perfect employee who preached about his perfect marriage and strong kids, and the man who made mom sob herself to sleep for buying the wrong coffee brand. Mom Learned to time grocery shopping before his Thursday bowling league when he'd be rushed. Once she forgot, dad discovered generic pasta instead of name brand. You're too stupid to even shop, right? No wonder you never amounted to anything. He made her return every item while he watched, then quizzed her on prices to prove she was wasting his money. She cried in the car afterward. That weekend's company barbecue. I do the shopping because the wife gets overwhelmed by choices. His co workers laughed at how understanding he was. My brother walked past Dad's home office during a virtual meet. Invisible for just two seconds, dad kept smiling, discussing collaborative workspace culture. The second he clicked leave meeting, he cornered my brother. You made me look like I can't control my own house. The belt came out. Two weeks of complete silence followed. My brother stopped eating, stopped talking at school. Teachers thought he was just shy. I saved money from my part time job for college application fees, knowing he'd never support it. He found them anyway. You think you're better than me? He burned them in the kitchen sink while I watched. Later, his boss Asked about my plans. She's applying everywhere. We stay up late working on essays together. I nodded and smiled, knowing I'd missed every deadline. Two fathers. Only we knew which one was real. Then my dad announced, the CEO is coming to dinner on Saturday. After ten years grinding for senior VP, a 1 hundred thousand dollar promotion, it came down to this. The CEO was famous for his values based leadership. He'd fired executives for screaming at waitstaff. I passed over vps for bad parenting in public. Now he wanted to see Dad's home life personally. With a three hour dinner. One mistake, dad hissed, and I'll make you regret it forever. But dad had never maintained his perfect act at home for more than 20 minutes. Phone calls, easy, quick. Doorway chats, no problem. But three hours in his kingdom, where he trained us to fear him. That's never happened before. Watched Mom's hands shake, my brother shrink into his chair. For 17 years, home was where dad dropped his mask. Saturday, he'd have to keep it on for three whole hours. There was no way, right? We all prepared like our lives depended on it. Practiced conversations, rehearsed dinner etiquette. Cleaned until the house looked like a magazine spread. I helped mom cover the bags under her eyes. My brother practiced speaking in full sentences. Again. Dad was a wreck. Pretending to be calm. He'd bark orders, catch himself, force a smile. Remember, we're a happy family. He'd say through gritted teeth, the vein in his forehead pulsing. Saturday arrived and the doorbell rang. Showtime, Dad whispered, transforming into the man his co workers knew. A warm smile with a firm handshake. Welcome to our home. The first hour was perfect. Dad told charming stories. We laughed at the right moments. Mom served flawlessly. But I watched dad carefully. Saw his jaw clench when my brother took too long answering a question. I noticed his knuckles whitening when mom laughed too loudly at the CEO's joke. I watched that familiar vein start to pulse. By hour, two cracks appeared. His smile became strained, his laugh forced. He was gripping his wine glass so tight, I thought it might shatter. This was the longest he'd ever had to pretend in his own home. And it was killing him. I didn't have to do anything. I just had to wait. Then it happened. During dessert, mom served the sea

Congratulations. That's called being a human. Look, I get it. Mental health awareness is hella important. It's amazing that people are talking about it more openly now. But here's the problem. Scrolling through hashtags at 2:00am is not the same thing as a professional evaluation. Google is not your therapist. ID Labs, tests are not your psychiatrist. And that one influencer who talks about their symptoms in a story time, definitely not a doctor. When everyone just casually slaps a label on themselves, it waters down the real struggles people actually face. Like someone living with legit OCD is out here battling life every day. And then some dude is like, oh my God, I'm so OCD. I color code my closet. No, you're not OCD. You're just organized, my guy. And even with depression, just because you're feeling a little sad one week does not mean you have depression unless you're diagnosed. I don't wanna hear it. You're free to self pity in private. But self diagnosing is probably one of the most selfish and attention seeking things you can do. Faith out.

It started at Thanksgiving when my cousin wouldn't shut up about me being single. She kept asking why I never brought anyone home, making these fake concerned faces at the dinner table. So when she said, I must be dating someone special, I just nodded, gave him a name right on the spot. Daniel said he was busy with work. My family ate it up. But then Christmas rolled around and my mom started asking when she could meet Daniel. My aunt kept texting about setting an extra place at dinner. I was stuck. That's when my roommate Becca suggested her coworker, Daniel, who owed her big time for covering his shifts. He showed me his Instagram, tall brown hair, actually decent looking. He agreed to one dinner as a favor. The problem, he didn't just show up and fake smile through dinner. He brought flowers for my mom, asked my dad about his woodworking hobby and somehow knew my grandmother collected vintage tea cups because I'd mentioned it once when building the fake story. He even laughed at my little brother's terrible jokes about robots. My family was obsessed. After that first dinner, my mom kept inviting him back, Easter brunch, my cousin's graduation party, random Sunday dinners. Daniel never said no. He text me beforehand asking what to bring, if anyone had allergies, stuff like that. He started sending my brother updates about basketball. Scores. My dad asked him to help fix our back porch. The worst part was how natural it felt. We drive to my parents house together and he'd ask about my day like we actually dated, remembered my coffee order, knew I hated mushrooms, would grab my jacket when I got cold. During family game night, he'd automatically pick me as his partner. We had inside jokes that weren't even planned. One night after my aunt's birthday party, we sat in his car outside my apartment in complete silence. Everyone had spent the whole night saying how perfect we looked together, how lucky I was. My grandmother even pulled me aside to say Daniel was a keeper. The whole car ride home, I kept filling glances at him, wondering what he was thinking. I started rehearsing speeches in my bathroom mirror, practice bringing it up casually over coffee. But every time I opened my mouth, nothing came out. How do you tell someone you caught feelings for a fake relationship? Everything changed at Christmas dinner. My aunt announced she'd been looking at wedding venues for us, that she found the perfect place for next fall. Daniel laughed it off perfectly, made some joke about her getting ahead of herself. But later that night, he texted me, we can't keep this up forever. You know, that message hit me like a truck. I realized he was ready to end this whole thing and I wasn't, not even close. Instead of texting Back or giving him some weird speech. I invited him over for dinner at my place, cooked his favorite pasta dish, the one my mom always made when he came over the table with actual candles, not just the overhead light. After we finished eating, I was washing dishes and he was drying them, just like we did at my parents house. That's when I finally said it. I know this.

Imagine what his wife and kids are feeling right now. His children can't grow up with their dad. His wife is now a single parent.

Because last night I was just scrolling, and a random person texted me saying, you should check out the ducky filter. And like the curious little George I am, I looked up the ducky filter, and I saw a little duck on the screen, and it said, tap the screen. And what did I do? I tap the dang screen. And when I say I scream so loud, I mean I tea. Because how is TikTok allows something like that? I threw my phone across the room so fast, not even the flash could save my phone in time. And if you think I'm being overdramatic, look it up yourself. But don't say I didn't warn you. But if you don't want to look. But you want to know what I saw. Pagorn like. Excuse me? You really think my innocent eyes were prepared to see something like that? And for the person who told me to look that up, I hope moonjoe gets you tonight. Anyways, bye.

My high school made all the boys holding their pee because someone wrote hi on the wall in Sharpie. Monday morning, we all showed up to find a sign taped to the boys bathroom door, closed until further notice due to vandalism. The girls bathroom was still open, of course, but our school only had one bathroom for boys in the entire building because it was an old school built in the 60s when they apparently thought teenage boys never needed to pee. Principal Carpenter made an announcement during 1st period, due to the disrespectful graffiti found in the boys restroom, this facility will remain locked until someone comes forward with information about who did it. The entire male population of our high school groaned at the same time. The crazy part was what the graffiti actually said. My friend Peyton had seen it Friday before they locked everything up. Someone had written hi in tiny letters on the bathroom stall. Not a curse word, not a drawing, just hi, I in black Sharpie about the size of a quarter. By lunch, the situation was getting desperate. Guys were asking teachers for hall passes to go to the nurse's office just to use that bathroom. But the school nurse caught on quick and started turning people away unless they were actually sick. Some guys tried using the staff bathroom but got detention for that. A few desperate souls walked To the gas station across the street during lunch. But security started watching for that, too. We tried talking to Principal Carpenter. Reasonably group of five guys went to his office to explain that punishing 300 boys for one tiny word was insane. He sat behind his big desk with his arms crossed. Actions have consequences. When the vandal comes forward, everyone gets bathroom privileges back. By Wednesday, things were getting bad. Guys were dehydrated from not drinking water all day. The basketball team couldn't practice properly because half the players were holding it in. Parents started calling to complain. The carpenter wouldn't budge. He sent out an email saying this was a lesson in collective responsibility. That's when Dean Patterson had his brilliant idea. He was this quiet kid.

It started at Thanksgiving when my cousin wouldn't shut up about me being single. She kept asking why I never brought anyone home, making these fake concerned faces at the dinner table. So when she said I must be dating someone special, I just nodded, gave him a name right on the spot. Daniel said he was busy with work. My family ate it up. But then Christmas rolled around, and my mom started asking when she could meet Daniel. My aunt kept texting about setting an extra place at dinner. I was stuck. That's when my roommate Becca suggested her coworker Daniel, who owed her big time for covering his shifts. She showed me his Instagram. Tall, brown hair, actually decent looking. He agreed to one dinner as a favor. The problem? He didn't just show up and fake smile through dinner. He brought flowers for my mom, asked my dad about his woodworking hobby, and somehow knew my grandmother collected vintage tea cups because I'd mentioned it once when building the fake story. He even laughed at my little brother's terrible jokes about robots. My family was obsessed after that first dinner. My mom kept inviting him back. Easter brunch, my cousin's graduation party, random Sunday dinners. Daniel never said no. He text me beforehand, asking what to bring, if anyone had allergies, stuff like that. He started sending my brother updates about basketball. Scores. My dad asked him to help fix our back porch. The worst part was how natural it felt. We drive to my parents'house together, and he'd ask about my day like we actually dated. He remembered my coffee order, knew I hated mushrooms, would grab my jacket when I got cold. During family game night, he'd automatically pick me as his partner. We had inside jokes that weren't even planned. One night, after my aunt's birthday party, we sat in his car outside my apartment in complete silence. Everyone had spent the whole night saying how perfect we looked together, how lucky I was. My grandmother even pulled me aside to say Daniel was a keeper. The whole car ride home, I kept feeling glances at him, wondering what he was thinking. I started rehearsing speeches in my bathroom mirror, practice bringing it up casually over coffee. But every time I opened my mouth, nothing came out. How do you tell someone you caught feelings for a fake relationship? Everything changed at Christmas dinner. My aunt announced she'd been looking at wedding venues for us. She found the perfect place for next fall. Daniel laughed it off perfectly, made some joke about her getting ahead of herself. But later that night, he texted me, we can't keep this up forever, you know? That message hit me like a truck. I realized he was ready to end this whole thing. And I wasn't. Not even close. Instead of texting back, Or giving him some weird speech. I invited him over for dinner at my place. Cooked his favorite pasta dish. The one my mom always made when he came over. Set the table with actual candles, not just the overhead light. After we finished eating, I was washing dishes and he was drying them. Just like we did at my parents house. That's when I finally said it. I know this.

The last one will shock you. His body language gives him away. He sneaks, glances at you, but quickly looks away when you notice. His feet or body are often pointed toward you. He plays with his hands, adjust clothes, taps foot when you're around. TikTok knows someone who has feelings for you, but it's too afraid to tell you it's the second person. When you click share and more, he gets nervous around you. His voice cracks or he stumbles over words. When talking to you, he finds small excuses to be near you. He shows up where you are more often than coincidence allows. He remembers the little things. Comment I hate when and let your keyboard finish the sentence. Even if he doesn't talk much, he notices details about you, like your favourite snack, something you said weeks ago. He pays attention in ways others might overlook. He interacts differently with you than with others. He may be loud and confident with friends, but quiet around you. He engages online more than in person. He texts, comments, or likes your posts, but is quieter face to face. He's more relaxed when there's no direct eye contact. Before the last fact. Please like the video and follow or you might never see me again. His friends know something. They tease him when you're around. They may drop hints or act differently toward you because they know how he Feels

She returned 6 years later to find I divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years Max. Change the locks. She left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation to our 8 year olds. That first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decisions. No more walking on eggshells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curve ball when our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year 2 brought unexpected changes without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids'grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping. I realized I've been so focused on fixing my marriage that I've forgotten how to enjoy my Children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her Bonus Mom, their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes and tucked them in at night. Year 5 was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and be being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year 6, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward after three years of Zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from the living room. Through the window, we watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck, pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she owned the plate.

My wife Stephanie, waited until we were eating dessert at Cassie and Paul's house to drop this on me. We should swap partners every Thursday, she said, and I literally watched her put her hand on Paul's thigh under the table. I saw it. Cassie saw it, too, and her face went blank. What? I asked because I honestly thought I heard her wrong. Partner swapping. We date each other's spouses. Said it like she was talking about switching cars for the weekend. Paul kept staring at his plate and wouldn't make eye contact with me. It's already decided, Stephanie said. Thursday nights, you take Cassie out, Paul takes me. I felt my chest get tight. When did they decide this without me? This is insane, I told her. Then she leaned in close and whispered, room 2:37 last Tuesday when you were at work. My whole body went numb. She was telling me she'd already cheated and now wanted my permission to keep doing it. So are you in or not? She asked louder. I looked at Cassie, and she was crying without making any sound. Fine, I said. Let's swap partners. Stephanie smiled like she just won something, but. And I noticed Cassie had stopped crying completely. That should have told me something right there. When the first date night came around, Stephanie spent forever getting ready. She put on this red Dress I'd never seen before that she'd been hiding in our closet. Paul's car was already running in our driveway when I left. I brought Cassie white roses because I remembered she mentioned liking them once. Her hands shook when she took them. Paul? Never. She started, then stopped. At dinner. She pushed her food around and barely ate anything. You okay? I asked. Paul's been different, she said quietly. For months, even before. Then she stopped talking again. I reached over and touched her hand. Before what? Nothing. Forget I said anything. But then her phone lit up with Stephanie's name, and she turned it face down immediately. When I got home that night, Stephanie was already there. Her hair was all messed up and her lipstick was smeared on the wrong side of her mouth. How is Cassie? Good. It was Paul. Then she started telling me everything they did. The hotel room, the balcony, what they did against the wall. She kept getting louder with each detail. Stop, I told her. Why? Don't you wanna know? No. Her face got all twisted up. Well, I'm telling you anyway. She kept going with more details while I pulled out my phone and texted Cassie, thank you for a lovely evening. Stephanie saw my screen and threw her wine glass at the wall. It shattered everywhere, and I just stood there looking at her. The next week, I had to pick Cassie up because her car broke down. Out Of nowhere. Paul was supposed to drive me, she said, looking confused. I forgot at dinner. She had way too much wine. Can I tell you something? She asked, and her eyes looked glassy. Tuesday afternoons. That's when it started. My heart started racing. What started? She covered her mouth with her hand. Nothing. Forget it. But Tuesday was when Stephanie had mentioned the hotel and we both knew what she meant. Then we had to go to Stephanie's parents house for dinner. Stephanie showed up late and I could smell Paul's Cologne all over her clothes. Her mom noticed it right away and her face changed. Is that men's Cologne? The whole table went quiet. We're sharing partners with Cassie and Paul, I said. Every week. Her dad dropped his fork and it made this loud sound. Sharing? Taking turns dating each other's spouses. Stephanie's idea. Her mom stood up from the table in my house, she said, and her voice was shaking. Stephanie tried to explain, but everyone had already smelled the Cologne and knew what was happening. That night Cassie called me. I know about Tuesday afternoons. I felt sick to my stomach about them. I followed Paul once four months ago to the hotel. She sounded drunk. I saw everything. By week five, everything fell apart. It was Cassie's birthday and I threw her a surprise party, made a video of all her artwork and gave the speech about how talented and kind she was. Paul Forgot it was her birthday completely. I watched Stephanie watch Cassie cry happy tears and hold on to me like she didn't want to let go. That night, Stephanie came home from Paul's and started telling me what they did in graphic detail again. Stop! I don't want to hear it. She got mad. But I'm telling you everything. I didn't ask. Then she demanded to know what Cassie and I did together.

So I packed my things and left, but now she's begging me to come back. Last Sunday at my in law's house for their 30th anniversary dinner, everything seemed perfect. My wife Emma was helping her mom arrange flowers while I watched the game with her dad. My buddy Josh was there, too. He's been like family since college, always invited to everything. The whole extended family was there, maybe 20 people total. Emma's cousins, her weird Uncle Dave who likes vintage spoons. Her grandmother, who still asks when we're having kids even though we've been trying for three years. After dinner, her Aunt Linda starts this thing where everyone shares their sliding door moments. Those what if scenarios that keep you up at night. Everyone's going around the table sharing cute stories. Her cousin Sarah talks about almost moving to Japan to teach English. Uncle Dave mentions nearly buying Bitcoin in 2,010. Her brother Tom jokes about almost joining the military instead of becoming an accountant. Normal, harmless stuff that gets people thinking. Then it's Emma's turn. She's had a few glasses of wine, and she gets this dreamy, distant look in her eyes, like she's somewhere else entirely. Honestly, she says, looking directly at Josh across the table, I sometimes think I should have dated Josh instead of Mark back in college. We just click so naturally, you know, the entire table goes Dead silent. Her dad literally chokes on his coffee and starts coughing violently. Her mom drops her fork with a loud clatter. Her grandmother's mouth falls open. I'm sitting right there like a complete idiot, watching my wife of eight years fantasize about my best friend in front of our entire family. Josh's face goes bright red. He starts stammering something about how that's not appropriate. But Emma just keeps going like she's in some kind of trance. I mean, we have so much more in common than Mark and I. I do. Josh actually listens when I talk about my art projects. He gets my sense of humor. He remembers little things I say. Sometimes I wonder if I settled too quickly. That last part hit like a freight train. Settled? After eight years of marriage, two miscarriages, buying our first house together, and me working overtime to pay for her art supplies, I settled. I excused myself to the bathroom. But really, I just sat in my car for 20 minutes trying to process what had just happened. My hands were shaking. I called my brother Mike, but couldn't even form words to explain. When I came back inside, everyone was pretending nothing happened, making awkward small talk.

Last Tuesday, I was making lunch for my kids when my phone rang. Unknown number, but I picked up anyway. Big mistake, right? This guy with a thick accent starts telling me he's from the IRS and I owe $4,200 in back taxes. As if I don't pay immediately with gift cards, the police will arrest me within an hour. Now, here's the thing. I literally just got my tax refund two weeks ago. My accountant, Beth, handled everything perfectly and I even got money back. So I knew this dude was full of it. But instead of hanging up, something clicked in my brain. My neighbour, Missus Kim, had fallen for this exact scam last month and lost $800. Time for payback. I started crying into the phone, oh, no, I can't go to jail. My kids need me. The scammer ate it up. He told me to go to target and buy iTunes gift cards worth $2,000 as a first payment. I said I needed an hour to get the money together. First, I called my cousin, Jake, who's a cop, told him what was happening and he said to keep the guy on the line as long as possible. Then I started my revenge tour. I called the scammer back an hour later sobbing. I'm at target, but I'm so confused. Which gift cards do I buy? He walked me through it step by step. I pretended to be this helpless Single mom who didn't understand technology. Sorry, can you repeat that? My hands are shaking so bad. For the next 20 minutes, I wandered around target asking him questions. Do I need the physical cards or the digital ones? The cashier is asking for ID is that normal? Sorry, my 4 year old is having a meltdown in the cart. Finally, I told him I had the cards. He was so excited, probably thinking about his commission. I read him the first number. Okay, it starts with 5. Wait, is that a 5?

It started at Thanksgiving when my cousin wouldn't shut up about me being single. She kept asking why I never brought anyone home, making these fake concerned faces at the dinner table. So when she said I must be dating someone special, I just nodded, gave him a name right on the spot. Daniel said he was busy with work. My family ate it up. But then Christmas rolled around, and my mom started asking when she could meet Daniel. My aunt kept texting about setting an extra place at dinner. I was stuck. That's when my roommate Becca suggested her co worker, Daniel, who owed her big time for covering his shifts. She showed me his Instagram. Tall, brown hair, actually decent looking. He agreed to one dinner as a favor. The problem? He didn't just show up and fake smile through dinner. He brought flowers for my mom, asked my dad about his woodworking hobby, and somehow knew my grandmother collected vintage tea cups because I'd mentioned it once when building the fake story. He even laughed at my little brother's terrible jokes about robots. My family was obsessed after that first dinner. My mom kept inviting him back. Easter brunch, my cousin's graduation party, random Sunday dinners. Daniel never said no. He text me beforehand, asking what to bring, if anyone had allergies, stuff like that. He started sending my brother updates about Basketball scores. My dad asked him to help fix our back porch. The worst part was how natural it felt. We drive to my parents house together and he'd ask about my day like we actually dated. He remembered my coffee order, knew I hated mushrooms, grab my jacket when I got cold. During family game night, he'd automatically pick me as his partner. We had inside jokes that weren't even planned. One night, after my aunt's birthday party, we sat in his car outside my apartment in complete silence. Everyone had spent the whole night saying how perfect we looked together, how lucky I was. My grandmother even pulled me aside to say Daniel was a keeper. The whole car ride home, I kept stealing glances at him, wondering what he was thinking. I started rehearsing speeches in my bathroom mirror, practice bringing it up casually over coffee. But every time I opened my mouth, nothing came out. How do you tell someone you caught feelings for a fake relationship? Everything changed at Christmas dinner. My aunt announced she'd been looking at wedding venues for us. Said she found the perfect place for next fall. Daniel laughed it off perfectly. Made some joke about her getting ahead of herself. But later that night, he texted me. We can't keep this up forever, you know? That message hit me like a truck. I realized he was ready to end this whole thing. And I wasn't. Not even close. Instead of Texting back or giving him some weird speech. I

How did we go from daily convos and inside jokes to seen and silence? And the worst part, I still care. I still see stuff and think they'd laugh at this or I wish I could tell them this, but I don't cause now it feel weird. Sad how people become strangers with memories. I can reach out, I can say something, but deep down I know if they wanted to talk to me, they would have. And I'm tired of always being the one holding the glue.

It's circled in thick red ink on every calendar in every relative's house. Growing up, it was just the day. If you asked why, you got a cold look and a quick we don't talk about December 3rd. I assumed it was just a creepy superstition. My cousins and I used to joke that it was the day someone sold their soul or bury gold or something equally ridiculous. But the adults, they didn't laugh. Ever. When I turned 28, I was engaged to the love of my life, Harper. She was funny, brilliant, and absolutely not into weird family rules. I didn't bring up the whole December 3rd thing until we started planning our wedding. Turns out the only date available at our dream venue was. Yep, December 3rd. I hesitated, not because I believed in any of it, but because I could already hear my mom's voice in my head. Over my dead body. Harper looked at me and said, do you actually believe anything will happen? No, I admitted, but my family will freak. So we did what rational adults do. We eloped. Quiet ceremony. Close friends, no one announcements. We figured we'd have a bigger party later and just say it was on a different date. We even posted the Photos on December 4th to avoid triggering anyone.

My brother saved our entire house because he refused to sleep. We had the strictest bedtime rule of any family I knew. Nine PM meant lights out, no exceptions, no matter what. Had projects or homework finish before 9, exams study before 9, gaming with friends? Definitely before 9. It didn't bother me much because I was 7, but it affected my brother a lot. He told me how he felt left out sometimes because his friends constantly texted about late night shows and online game he'd never see. My brother was the only eighth grader who had to be in bed before fourth graders. Growing bodies need 10 hours of sleep. Mom and dad would say nothing good happens after 9 anyway. But my brother tried everything to change their minds. He offered to get straight A's in exchange change for a 10:30 bedtime. He showed them studies about how teens only need five hours of sleep to function well compared to kids and adults, but they still refused. When you're 18, you can destroy your sleep schedule all you want. My brother looked heartbroken. 18 was so far off and by then he'd be too old to enjoy it. That's when my brother became an expert at fake sleeping. He Learned to lie completely still with his eyes shut, breathing so evenly that mom's flashlight checks never caught him. He could hear footsteps on the stairs from two Rooms away and transform from wide awake to dead asleep in two seconds. After the ten PM inspection, he'd wait exactly 20 minutes for our parents to pour their wine and start their TV shows. He made me promise never to tell. In exchange, he'd let me stay up too sometimes with him. It was like our own secret midnight meetings and our parents never really caught on. They ended up bragging to everyone about how well we listen to their rules. But then one day my brother got cornered into a wall and was left.

So I left. I was looking at credit card statements last month when my fiance Bianca was packing for another girl's trip, her fourth this year. We need to talk about these trips. I said. This Miami one will cost at least $3,000. That's 12,000 this year alone. She rolled her eyes. I work hard. I deserve fun. The thing was I covered all our expenses, rent, utilities, groceries, her car payment. Her entire salary was play money. You spend your whole income on trips while I cover everything else. I pointed out my trips are non negotiable. She said, you don't like it, then leave. She said it so casually like our five year relationship meant nothing. Fine. I said I'll leave. She laughed over a girl's trip? Seriously? Over you telling me to leave rather than discuss our finances like adults. Yeah. She grabbed her suitcase from Miami without even saying goodbye. I called my brother. Still have that empty room, started packing immediately. While packing, found receipts from her Vegas trip, bottle service, VIP sections and a 500 dollar receipt from a men's clothing store. Who buys men's clothes on a girl's trip. Next morning, removed her as authorized user on my credit cards. By Saturday, 47 missed calls from her friends in Miami. Her card got declined. Sunday she texted, my cards are maxed. I'm stranded. Use your own cards. I replied, that's financial Abuse. This is me leaving like you suggested. Monday I went to our apartment early, packed all my stuff, took everything I bought, TV, gaming console, coffee maker, even the good shower head. Left her designer clothes and makeup. Left a note as suggested, I've left rents paid through months end. After that, it's your responsibility. Also left, print out showing 47,000 thousand dollars spent on girls trips over three years, almost a house down payment. She exploded by a text, you took the TV. Are you 12? This is theft. Then pivoted to, please let's talk. I'm sorry. Showed up at my office, had security escort her out. Posted on Instagram about toxic men who can't handle independent women. Comments weren't what she expected. Independent? Don't you live in his apartment? Maybe he got tired of funding your lifestyle. She deleted it within an hour. Week later, she emailed, I can't afford the apartment. My cards are maxed. Parents think I'm irresponsible. Please come home. I'll cancel the next.

So my whole family had been using my Amazon Prime account for like three years. My mom, my sister Ashley, my Uncle Rick. Even my grandma somehow figured out how to order stuff. I was paying for it because I actually use Amazon all the time for work stuff and groceries, but they were just leeching off it. The breaking point happened two weeks ago. I check my account and see 17 packages coming to different addresses. 17! My sister ordered a whole workout set she'll never use. My mom got some fancy face cream that cost 60 bucks, and my Uncle Rick ordered a drone he definitely doesn't need. But the worst part was my cousin Blake ordered a gaming chair that cost $400. I called Blake and asked him what the hell he was thinking. He just laughed and said it's not his problem. I gave everyone access. He said if I didn't want people using it, I shouldn't have shared the password. This kid just graduated high school and acts like he runs the world. So I called my mom and told her everyone needed to chip in for prime or get their own accounts. She got all dramatic and said family should help each other out. She reminded me how she used to buy me clothes when I was younger. I told her that was literally her job as a parent and not the same thing at all. Then Ashley calls me crying, saying she can't afford her own prime account because she's saving for a wedding. I reminded her that her wedding is in two years, and she just spent $300 on workout clothes she turned last month. She said I was being petty and that it's only like $10 a month split between everyone. I did the math. If everyone chipped in 10 bucks, that would actually cover prime and give me extra money. But when I suggested this in our family group chat, suddenly everyone had excuses. My mom said she's on a fixed income. Ashley said she's saving for the wedding. Rick said he barely uses it anyway, which is a lie because he ordered protein powder just yesterday. The final straw was when my grandma called me, confused about why her soap order got canceled. Turns out my account got flagged for suspicious activity. Because there were so many different addresses, Amazon temporarily locked my account and I couldn't order my medication.

It's like being right there, sitting with them, but still invisible. You laugh when they laugh, but deep down you know you're laughing at something you weren't even part of. You watch them get closer and closer, and you start questioning yourself, like, what's wrong with me? Why am I never enough to be chosen? It's the kind of hurt that doesn't scream. It just sits heavy in your chest until you feel like breaking. And the worst part is, you can pour your heart out, you can beg them to understand, but nothing changes. They keep being a duo, and you keep being the leftover. That's when it hits you. You deserve better than fighting for scraps of attention. You deserve friends who make you feel like you belong, who don't make you wonder if you're the problem. It's so hard to let go. But sometimes you have to. Because staying in that kind of pain is worse than being alone.

Bro, on the exam it's if Johnny invests his apples at a 7% return while traveling at the speed of light, how many apples does he have left in a black hole? What? Where was that in the notes? And the best part is when they say if anyone has doubts, ask me. So one kid actually raises his hand like um, I don't get No. 3 and instead of helping, the teacher goes full roast mode.

The exam is proof why 2 + 2 = 4 using 18 pages of logic. When it's finally over, they smile and go see? It wasn't that hard. Bro, that wasn't an exam. That was a boss fight.

A 23 year old Ukrainian woman moved to the United States for a better life, only to lose it in the most tragic way on a train in Charlotte. Her name was Irina. She was just heading home after work, wearing her pizza shop T-shirt, AirPods in, minding her own business like everybody else on that train. But sitting right behind her was a man in a red hoodie, restless, agitated. And within minutes, he pulled out a knife and attacked her, completely unprovoked. She never even saw it coming. The man, the Carlos Brown, wasn't some random first time offender. He had a long history of violent crime and mental illness. He'd already served prison time, and he wasn't even supposed to be on that train because he didn't have a ticket. Yet somehow, he was there. And because of that, a young woman who just wanted safety ended up losing her life. Other passengers who witnessed it said they're traumatized. And honestly, who wouldn't be? You're just commuting home, and suddenly something unthinkable happens right in front of you. This story is more than a headline. It's a reminder of how fragile life really is. Rant signing off.

Her little brother would literally follow me around their house, begging me to teach him how to fix engines. Someone who never had a real family, being part of theirs felt like everything I've been missing my whole life. I've been saving every extra dollar from my job at Murphy's Auto Shop for months. The ring wasn't fancy, just a simple band with a small diamond, but it was real and it was all I could afford. I planned everything perfectly. Sophia's dad was turning 60 and they were throwing this big backyard BBQ. All her family would be there, plus her closest friends. She always said family was the most important thing to her. So I figured proposing surrounded by everyone who loved us both would be perfect. The party was going great. Sophia's mom made her famous brisket. Her dad was telling embarrassing stories about Sophia as a kid. And everyone was laughing and having a good time. After they brought out the birthday cake and saying happy birthday, I figured it was the perfect moment. My hands were shaking as I tapped my beer bottle with a fork to get everyone's attention. The whole backyard went dead silent. Sophia Looked confused at first, then her eyes went wide. When I got down on one knee and pulled out the ring box, her mom gasped and started tearing up. Her dad had this huge smile on his face. Her friends were already pulling out their phones to record the moment. I opened the box and said all the things I've been practicing in my head for weeks, how much I loved her, how she changed my life, how I wanted to spend forever making her happy. The words just poured out of me. But Sophia just stood there frozen, not good, frozen like she was overwhelmed with happiness. Bad frozen like she'd seen a ghost. Liam, she finally said, and I could hear the panic in her voice, I love you so much, but I'm not ready for this. I'm so sorry. The silence that followed was the worst sound I'd ever heard, 30 people just staring at us, not knowing what to do or where to look. I stayed on one knee for probably five seconds too long, trying to process what had just happened. Then I slowly stood up, shoved the ring box back in my pocket and nodded. Okay, I said, because what else could I say? Sophia reached for my arm, but I stepped back. I couldn't deal with her trying to comfort me in front of everyone. I mumbled something about needing to go and walked straight to my truck. The drive home was the Longest 20 minutes of my life. I stayed up all night staring at the ceiling, replaying every conversation we'd ever had about the future. We talked about getting married, about kids, about buying a house together. How had I read everything so wrong? Next day I was under the hood of a broken down Chevy trying to lose myself in work when I heard footsteps approaching. I looked up expecting to see my boss, but it was so.

I painted it. I was standing in front of my largest piece at the gallery opening, champagne in hand, when a man in an expensive suit approached and started explaining my own painting to me. He had no idea I was the artist because the placard said Riley Turner, who he clearly assumed was a man since he kept talking about his brilliant technique. This guy, Robert, looked me up and down and said, you seem young to be at an opening like this. Let me guess. Looking for a rich boyfriend, smart girl, lots of wealthy men here. He gestured at my painting like he owned it. See, what Riley is doing here requires years of training to appreciate. You probably just think the colors are pretty. The average woman just sees decoration. I took a sip of champagne and said, interesting perspective, which I guess he took as encouragement. Robert moved closer to the painting, physically stepping in front of me and continued his lecture. A girl like you probably thinks this is just nice to look at, but there's actual intelligence behind it. The artist is obviously a man because women simply don't have this kind of technical mastery. Female painters do flowers and feelings. This has real intellectual depth. It's biological, really. Men are just more capable of this level of abstraction. When I mentioned I was familiar, With the artist's work, Robert laughed and patted my shoulder. Following him on Instagram to look at the pretty pictures doesn't count as being familiar with art, sweetheart. You probably think you're cultured because you went to that Van Gogh light show. Real knowledge comes from decades of study, not whatever you Learned from TikTok. Robert decided to test me, rapid firing questions. Who's basket? What's Kiara Scuro? Name three Renaissance painters besides da Vinci. When I started to answer, he cut me off. Wrong. See, this is why galleries shouldn't have open events. You probably googled some terms before coming here to impress men. But Riley here is working in a tradition you couldn't possibly understand without a proper education. Not community college, sweetie, real universities. He returned to my painting now explaining it louder to draw a crowd. What Riley has achieved here would cost probably 100,000 in education to even attempt. The materials alone cost more than you'd make in a month at whatever retail job you have. He looked at my outfit with disgust. Target clearance rack, right? Someone who shops there couldn't possibly grasp the investment in this piece. Probably spent more on one brush than your entire outfit. When I suggested the artist might be self taught, Robert sneered at me. Is that how you Learned about art? Painting parties? Robert grabbed my wrist to pull me to another angle. His grip too tight. You're too stupid to even stand in the right spot. Riley intended for this to be viewed from exactly here. Your ignorance is actually disrespectful to his work. He kept his hand on my wrist while explaining, though honestly, explaining this to you is like teaching calculus to a toddler. You lack the basic foundation to understand any of it. He noticed me trying to pull away and.

I'm 23 and my family still cuts my food for me at restaurants. Not kidding. My mom will literally reach over and slice my chicken into bite size pieces while I'm eating it. Growing up as the youngest of seven kids by a huge gap didn't help. My siblings are all 10, 15 years older than me. So they've always treated me like their living doll at family dinners. They still ask if I need help tying my shoes or if I remembered to brush my teeth. My sister Amanda still tries to help me order at restaurants, telling in servers she'll have the chicken nuggets without asking what I want. Last month at my cousin Abigail's wedding was the absolute worst. The whole extended family was there, aunts, uncles, grand, grandparents, great aunts, family, friends. The worst, during cocktail hour, my Aunt Janet loudly announced that I couldn't have champagne because babies don't drink alcohol. She handed me a juice box instead. A juice box at a wedding? I'm 23 years old with a medical degree. Then came dinner seating. My Uncle Mark grabbed my arm and said, come on, sweetie, you're sitting at the kids table. I tried to protest, explaining I was an adult, but he was already walking me over to a table full of actual children. Eight year olds coloring on placemats. Ten year olds playing with action figures and me with my college degree. And my job that none of them bothered asking about. The kids kept asking me questions like what grade are you in and do you like our coloring books? I spent the entire dinner helping a six year old nephew cut his chicken while my family laughed from the adult tables, pointing and taking photos like it was cute. My cousin Kelly walked over during appetizers. Ah, look at you helping the little ones, she cooed. Maybe someday you'll be ready for grown up conversations. She patted my head like I was a golden retriever. The breaking point came during cake cutting. When the bride and groom finished their ceremonial first slice, they started serving guests. My Uncle Mark walked over with a plate and a plastic fork. A plastic fork. Let me help you with this, honey, he said, and started cutting my slice into tiny little pieces like I was a toddler who might choke. Uncle Mark, I can careful with the fork, sweetie. He interrupted, taking it from my hands. We don't want any accidents. Remember what happened at Christmas when you tried to use the good silverware? I haven't dropped anything at Christmas. He was just making stuff up. The entire reception was staring at this point. Other guests were whispering and pointing. Some were filming with their phones. I felt my face burning with embarrassment. That's when the bridesmaid of honor walked over. She was this elegant woman in her 40s looking confused. Excuse me. Are you Doctor Nguyen? She asked, staring directly at me. Everyone at nearby tables turned to look. My Aunt Janet burst out laughing like this was the funniest thing she'd ever heard. Oh, honey, that's just our baby cousin, she said condescendingly. She's still figuring out college classes and living in the dorms, playing dress up as a doctor. Aren't you, sweetie? The woman's face went from confused to absolutely shocked. Ma'am, this is Doctor Nguyen. She performed emergency brain surgery on my six year old daughter.

The Disney princess stopped mid autograph, stared at my ankle, then at my six year old daughter, Emma, then back at my ankle. Sir, is that. She started clearly breaking character, which apparently requires something serious at the happiest place on earth. It's not what you think, I said quickly, but Cinderella was already flagging security. Within minutes, I was surrounded by three guards and mouse ear hats trying to look threatening, while tourists took photos of what they assumed was part of the show. Here's the thing. I'm not a criminal. The ankle monitor was court ordered, but not for the reason everyone assumes. My ex wife, Patricia, claimed I was a flight risk during our custody battle. Said I might take Emma to Brazil because I'd renewed my passport. I renewed it for a work conference in Toronto. Judge still ordered the monitor as a precaution until custody was finalized. I've been wearing it for three months, setting off every metal detector in Orange County. Emma didn't understand why Cinderella looked scared. Daddy, why is the princess sad? I knelt down, ankle monitor clicking against the pavement. She's just confused about daddy's special bracelet. Security moved closer. One spoke into his radio. We have a code yellow in fantasy land. I didn't know what that meant, but it sounded bad. Tourists and pulling their kids away from us. One mom loudly whispered, that's why we Check the registry, Karen. The head of security, a surprisingly intimidating man named Raul, escorted us to Disney Jail. Yes, that's a real thing. It's a small office behind Main Street that smells like churros and broken dreams. Emma thought it was a VIP experience. Are we getting special Mickey ears? She asked. Raul pulled up my information on his computer. His expression shifted from suspicious to confused to sympathetic. Like custody battle? He asked quietly. I nodded. He sighed. My brother went through the same thing. Judge made him wear one for six months because his ex said he'd flee to Cuba. He's never even been to Cuba. Raul made some calls. Twenty minutes later, we had a Disney escort. Not because I was dangerous, but because Raul felt bad. No kids should have their Disney trip ruined by adult problems, he said. Our escort, Jerome, was a former NBA player who'd retired to work at Disney because he loved making kids happy. Emma rode on his shoulders the entire day. We, every line, got front row seats to every show. Jerome told everyone I was a special guest, which technically wasn't a lie. The ankle monitor kept setting off the sensors on rides. Space Mountain stopped three times because of me. They had to manually override the system. By the third ride, the operators knew me by name. Ankle monitor dad is back, they'd radio ahead. It became a running joke. One operator said, you know, we've had Weapons, drugs, even a snake once. But you're our first ankle monitor. I chose to take that as an achievement. Plot twist came at dinner. We were at the character meal when goofy sat down at our table. He pointed at my ankle, then did an elaborate MIME of being arrested, going to court, then being innocent. Emma laughed hysterically. Goofy's silly daddy. But then goofy pulled out his phone.

My brother Jake has this girlfriend named Becca who literally cannot stand not being the centre of attention for five minutes. Every family dinner, every holiday, every gathering, she finds a way to make it about her. Last Thanksgiving, she announced she was pregnant right when my dad was about to carve the Turkey. Turns out she wasn't even pregnant. Just wanted to see everyone's reactions. So when I was planning my wedding to my fiance Ryan, I knew I had to do something about the Becca situation. This was going to be my one day. The one day that was supposed to be about me and Ryan starting our life together. I called Jake about three months before the wedding. Hey, so about the wedding I started. I need to ask you something kind of awkward. What's up? He said, and I could hear him eating cereal in the background. I really don't want Becca there. I know that sounds harsh, but she always makes everything about herself, and I just can't deal with that stress. On my wedding day, the line went quiet for, like, 10 seconds, and Jake exploded. Are you serious right now? You're uninviting my girlfriend from your wedding? I'm not uninviting her because she was never invited in the first place. The invitation was just for you. That's the same thing. We've been together for two years. He's basically family. I tried To explain that it wasn't personal, that I just wanted one drama free day. But Jake wasn't having it. He said if Becca couldn't come, then he wouldn't come either. I told him that was his choice, hoping he'd change his mind. He didn't. But here's where it gets crazy. The day of my wedding, I'm getting my makeup done in the bridal suite when my cousin Madison bursts in. Uh, you need to see this, she says, shoving her phone in my face. It's Becca's Instagram story. She's posted, like, 15 videos of herself getting all dressed up, doing her makeup, picking out jewellery. The caption on the last one says, can't wait to celebrate love today. With a bunch of heart emojis and the location tagged as our wedding venue. My heart drops. He's coming anyway. Madison nods. Jake's outside right now, arguing with your dad about it. He says he changed his mind and decided to bring her. I'm standing there in my wedding dress, half my makeup done, and I have to deal with.

I found my work crush share crying in the break room, looking completely stressed. My dad's in the hospital and I need to fly out tonight, but I can't find anyone to watch my kids. My ex won't answer, the babysitter I hired bailed, and I just. I can't afford to miss this flight, but I can't afford anything else either. She leaned against my shoulder, crying even harder. I volunteered without thinking. I'll watch them, I said, heart racing from how close she was to me. Are you serious? It's three kids. Three for at least two weeks. I waved my hand around like a lovesick fool. How hard can it be? The kids showed up at my apartment that night with tons of suitcases. The oldest, around 14, looked at her mom and said, really? Another boyfriend? Cher's face went red. He's just a friend from work. Camilla. The middle one, 10, rolled his eyes. The youngest, seven, wouldn't even look at me, stood in my doorway like they were being sentenced to prison. Cher hug them quickly told them to be good, and left for the airport. I stood there with three kids who clearly hated me and realized I was in way over my head. The first morning, I woke up early to make them pancakes. When the oldest one, Camilla, laughed. She's not here, you know. You can stop trying, she said. Besides, you're not her type. Mom doesn't date guys without kids. We've seen this a dozen times already. It hurt, but it wasn't a lie. Cher's co workers, guys from her gym, men from dating apps. Everyone wanted to play dad until they realized three kids meant actual work. And the kids really didn't make it any easier. From spilling drinks on my laptop to turning the TV up during important zoom meetings, they hated every second with me. Dude, just survive until she gets back, then ask her out. My friend told me that became the plan. Survive two weeks, do whatever to keep the kids happy. Be the hero, finally land a date with share. But like most things, it doesn't always happen the way you want it to. Sometime within the second week, the middle kid, Murph, came home from school trying to hide a black eye. Before I could even ask, Camilla grabbed ice from the freezer and held it against his face. Just pretend you didn't see anything, she told me coldly. I bent down beside them and asked in a kind but stern voice, tell me what happened. Just leave me alone, he said, turning away. I shook my head. I'm not here to lecture you or get get mad at you or do anything without your permission. Not even tell your mom. But I need to know what happened. Murph blinked at me and frowned. Someone called me an orphan because I don't Have a dad! I patted his head and thanked him, walking away as calm as I could, even though all the blood in my body was boiling with anger. Next afternoon, I took a half day at work and showed up at their school in a rented GTR, strikingly white engine, purring like a monster. I rolled down the window and waved, wearing sunglasses and a black polo. Who's got the coolest dad now? I said loudly, as Murph and his friends ran over excitedly. Murph watched his bully's jaw drop and quickly hopped in. He rolled down the window and flipped him off, which was my signal to immediately drive off the middle school campus. Okay, I like the enthusiasm, but let's never tell your mother about this, I said, grinning. I picked up the other two kids and took them to in and out for a quick afternoon snack, then surprised them with a baseball game. Murph ate in a helmet full of nachos, and I managed to snag a foul ball for little Celia. Not bad, old man, Camilla said, watching her siblings enjoy the game. We made sure to take pics with the car and at the stadium, all covered in ketchup and mustard, sent everything to their mom with a caption we wish you were here. After that, things between me and the kids sort of changed. When the youngest, Celia, had a nightmare and called for her mom, I sat beside her bed reading Out fairy tales until she fell asleep. I made the kids meals and lunch box.

I'm thankfully safe using the last bits of data and VPN I have to make this. So let me fully explain what's going on in Indonesia. So the government here is very corrupt and raise taxes by 250%. I believe teachers here are making about $20 a month. So people decided to protest against this as this is wrong and the government and police responded with violence. Police ran over a man with no remorse. I will show some bits of it for clear reasons I won't show the bit where he was run over but the man died and they were also shooting rubber bullets at people. I was looking at what was going on with my aunt and I was hit by a bullet. The bullet hit my leg and it was really painful and I now have a slight limp. But not only that, police started bombing mosques with tear gas, innocent people who just wanted to pray. Now they cut off all internet access and that's why I frantically made my recent video but luckily my aunt had a hot box that switched my internet stuff to be American so I still kind of have access to most stuff but the payment for the box thing is too expensive so I don't know how much I have left. So if I don't post for a while is to save the Data, but I will update soon. Until then, please boost to spread awareness. Even if this video has 0 likes, please just like and comment to boost this video. Bye.

My stomach sank. What bracelet? She pulled out her phone and showed me a receipt. 3,000 dollar custom gold bracelet with your birthstone delivered four months ago. I'd never seen it in my life. My mom suddenly got very interested in her coffee cup. Dad started scrolling through his phone like nothing happened. The air in the restaurant felt thick with tension. Mom, I said slowly, did you sign for a package addressed to me? Her face went red. We thought it was a mistake. Grandma sends so many things. A mistake? Grandma's voice could cut glass. I had it engraved with his name. And track the delivery myself. I watched my parents exchange that look, the same guilty look they'd been giving each other for months whenever grandma brought up gifts or money. I thought I was being paranoid. But now everything was starting to make sense. Show me the tracking information. Dad interrupted, trying to sound authoritative. Grandma scrolled through her phone. Delivered to your front door on March 15th at two forty seven PM signed for by Leora Hensley. She looked directly at my mom. That's you, isn't it, Leora? My mom's hands started shaking. I, I don't remember every package that comes to the house. You don't remember a 3,000 dollar piece of jewelry? Grandma's eyebrows shot up. That's when I noticed my sister's new tennis bracelet sparkling on her wrist. The same design. The same stones, the same everything. My stomach dropped. I'd seen Alara wearing it for weeks, bragging to her friends about how she'd treated herself after getting good grades. Alara's idea of treating herself was usually a five dollar coffee, not luxury jewelry. Alara, I said, staring at her arm. Where did you get that? She yanked her sleeve down faster than I'd ever seen her move. I, um, saved up for it. Alara works part time at a smoothie shop making $12 an hour. She spends most of her paycheck on makeup and clothes. There was no way she had $3,000 saved. How long did you save? I pressed, feeling my anger building. Like a few months, she mumbled, not making eye contact. A few months of smoothie shop money bought you a 3,000 dollar bracelet. Mom jumped in. Alara has been very responsible with her money lately. Really? I turned to my parents because last month she asked me for $20 for gas money. The month before that, she needed $50 for textbooks. Just last week she was complaining about being broke. Dad cleared his throat. Lauren, you're being dramatic. Maybe Alara got a bonus or from a smoothie shop. I cut him off. Alara, what's the most expensive thing you've ever bought with your own money? She fidgeted with her napkin. I don't know, maybe my phone case, which cost like $30. The math wasn't mathing and everyone at the table knew it. Grandma leaned forward her Eyes locked on Alara's bracelet. Show me that bracelet now. I don't wanna take it off, Alara said, her voice getting smaller. It might fall.

If you're here legally, you'll probably be let go and will probably be fired from your job because you were out of contact for multiple days. There was a decision made by the Supreme Court today that says it is okay for the immigration police to surround large groups of people and take all of them to jail. Normally, the Supreme Court has to give some sort of explanation for this type of decision. In this case, it did not give any explanation. Normally, the Supreme Court members that made the decision have to sign their names to the order. In this case, they did not sign their names to the order. Lower courts had placed significant restrictions on Trump's efforts to ramp up immigration arrests, but now the Supreme Court says no restrictions.

Now my he wants my house. When I was 16, my gaming obsessed brother Tyler convinced my parents I was taking up too much space in our cramped three bedroom apartment. He'd been complaining for months that he needed my room for his elaborate gaming setup. My parents sat me down one evening and basically said I had two weeks to find alternative living arrangements. The reasoning? I was almost 17, practically an adult, and Tyler needed space to pursue his passion in gaming and dreaming. They genuinely believed he was going to become the next big Twitch star. I was devastated, but had nowhere to go. My girlfriend Emma's parents noticed I'd been spending more time at their house and eventually asked what was going on. When I explained the situation, her mom immediately said I could stay stay with them as long as I needed, no questions asked. Emma and I got serious fast. Living under the same roof will do that to a relationship. When we turned 19, I proposed with a ring. I'd saved six months for working overtime every weekend. Her parents were thrilled. They basically raised me for two years anyway and considered me their son. At 23, we finally had enough saved for a down payment on a small two bedroom house. Nothing fancy. We spent every weekend renovating, learning YouTube tutorials, making mistakes and fixing them. Meanwhile, Tyler was still living with my parents in his Gaming paradise. He dropped out of community college after one semester, claiming his streaming career was about to take off. College was just holding him back. Three years later, he was still grinding away at maybe five viewers on a good day. Sleeping until two PM, gaming until 4:00am. Ordering Doordash with my parents money. My parents occasionally texted generic holiday messages or shared Facebook posts about family, but otherwise we had zero relationship. Last month my mom showed up at my house completely unannounced. I hadn't seen her.

Charlie Kirk just got shot in the neck. Simple as that. He's a conservative. He's a Christian. You know, all he did was debate people. He never hurt anyone. He always made sure everything was light hearted and fun, talking about LeBron James and Michael Jordan and shit like that. And he, he was never, he, he's not a bad guy. I'm not gonna get into my political views because I'm not trying to lose a platform. But I think truly there is no possible justification for what happened to him. You guys see him in the fucking TikToks or whatever talking to whoever, but you don't know he has a family he goes home to, he has two, he has two daughters that are toddlers. He has a wife. He has a parent. He has parents. Like he has a family. And you guys are willing to take away his life because you disagree with what he says. I'm not trying to stretch it, but he's, he's literally a modern day MLK. Like he's an activist. Okay. I'm like, I'm so dead ass. I'm so serious. This is like an actual horrible situation. He was truly a puppet of God. And, and he did so much good for the world, even though people like couldn't see it. And even if you disagree, there's no reason to take someone's life. Like there was kids, not that audience. There was women, there was men, there was, it's just breathtaking. This world truly needs more Christ. And please keep his family and him in your prayers.

My husband walked up to my 8 months pregnant sister during her baby shower and punched her full force in the stomach. She folded in half and crashed backward into the gift table. While 50 guests screamed, I shoved him backward screaming, what is wrong with you? While my mom called 9 1 1, sobbing about assault on a pregnant woman. My dad and brothers pinned my husband against the wall and I was hitting his chest, calling him a psychopath while my sister lay on the floor holding her belly and crying that something was wrong. Her boyfriend was checking for blood and everyone was filming while my grandmother was having chest pains from the shock. My aunts grabbed their kids and ran while I dropped beside my sister trying to feel the baby kick, but she kept pushing my hands away saying don't touch, it hurts too much. The neighbor who was a midwife tried to come help, but my sister curled into a ball screaming not to touch her stomach. My uncle was on the phone with his lawyer saying we needed to press charges for attempted murder of an unborn child. While my sister's mother in law fainted and had to be laid on the couch, my sister kept her arms wrapped around her stomach so tight nobody could get close, crying that she could feel something was wrong inside. Look at Her stomach where I hit her, my has been yelled while fighting against the men holding him and I wanted to kill him until I saw it, a deep dent in my sister's belly that wasn't popping back out. That's memory foam under her dress, not a baby. And I can prove everything she's been doing. I got to my sister before she could stop me and felt around the dent. My hands went numb pressing against foam edges and Velcro straps where my nephew should have been. She's been buying different sized fake bellies online to fake the progression, stealing ultrasound photos from pregnancy forums and photoshopping her name on them and scamming everyone for $30,000 in medical bills for appointments that never existed because I checked with every OB in the city. I kept pressing on the dented foam while my sister tried to push me away and everyone started grabbing at her stomach, finding more straps and padding underneath. I followed her after she said she had an OB appointment yesterday and she went to a bar and drank for two hours, then bought three more fake bellies at a costume shop downtown. My sister was crying.

There has been a school shooting in Denver. A girl got stabbed on the subway and no one helped her. A decomposing body found in D4V D's car. A man was beheaded at Dallas motel. Charlie Kirk getting shot and killed at a university. And all on top of that, the 9 11 was 24 years ago today. As much as I hate Charlie Kirk and his decisions, no one deserves to get killed. Imagine what his wife and kids are feeling right now. His children can't grow up with their dad. His wife is now a single parent. I genuinely hate Charlie, but I can't imagine how his family is handling this right now. And apparently they witnessed it. The way the blood came out of his neck was genuinely traumatizing. The way his body went limp immediately was horrifying. But anyways, moving on to the D4 V D situation. He's been on tour for like what, a month now? He hasn't been in LA for like a month. And the body hadn't decomposed enough for it to be in that car for so long. The body was in there for three days, and the police haven't even made him a suspect. And plus he had a concert like yesterday, I'm pretty sure. But yeah, moving on to the girl that was stabbed. She was literally minding her business before she got stabbed. And as soon as she got stabbed, everyone was So calm. Like, hello, she needs help. There was literal blood dripping on the floor.

But I'm not even gonna hate, because I am absolutely dragging my host mom to target to get some so I can blend in with the cult members. Anyway, first thing they gave me was my schedule, and then first thing I did was hide in the bathroom, because what the fuck do you mean I'm supposed to actually talk to people? Absolutely not. Homeroom teacher was chill, though. Shout out to Mr. Lincoln for not forcing me to stand up and introduce myself. Fucking legend. Thankfully, my host sister was in most of my classes, so I just stayed with her and her friends. Now, my classes were really easy, like I suspected. So to the people who told me school was gonna Be hard. Yikes. That is, until I had biology fifth period, bro. I did not realize how many science words exist that I don't know in English. They gave me a language helper, like a translator. I felt like a fucking idiot. They also messed up my classes again and put me in French class. What am I supposed to do in there? They said it's gonna take a few weeks before I get my classes switched. But you know what? I actually kind of get it now. I get why you guys hate French, but I don't even think it's the language's fault. I think your teachers just hate their jobs. About lunch. Oh, my god. Lunch was disgusting. Starting to feel like the chicken was not chicken. How are you people not dying from this? Do you just build immunity over the years? Like a vaccine, but edible? Also, why is it so short? 45 minutes. That is not enough. I'm gonna stop here before this turns into a fucking documentary. Tomorrow I'll give you the tea on the people instead of the school itself. Anyways, I'm done yapping, so bye.

I've been dating Yuki for six months. When she finally invited me to Sunday dinner with her family, my hands were sweating because this girl meant everything to me and family approval was her world. Just warning you, she said, gripping the steering wheel. They can be protective and they speak Japanese at home, so don't take it personally if they seem cold. I nodded, my stomach in knots. But she didn't know Japanese was my first language. Half Japanese through my mom, but I inherited every single one of my Irish dad's genes. Pale skin, light eyes, the works. People see me and assume white guy. And honestly, sometimes it's been easier to let them. Tanaka House hit me like a warm hug. Keco's cooking filled the air. Multiple generations chatted everywhere. Yuki's mom greeted me with a polite bow and formal smile. Nice to meet you, she said in careful English. The pleasure is mine. Tanakasan. That's when I caught it. The second I turned to her dad, I heard Keiko whisper to Yuki's aunt Kogai, when I got to, when I did, so you, this foreigner won't last long. Game on. For the next hour, I smiled politely while they served me passive aggression, English to my face, Japanese when they thought I couldn't understand and they were brutal me. Te Kogai, Yuki's grandmother said, passing rice. Look at this. Foreigner, so pale and weak looking. Karare washashitsukaina, her uncle muttered. He can't even hold chopsticks properly. No manners. Tommy enjoying the food, Yuki's cousin asked sweet, then whispered, he probably doesn't know what he's eating. I gritted my teeth but stayed quiet. Be polite. Don't cause a scene, Kiko said, refilling my tea. This person is so rude, doesn't even try to learn our customs, the aunt added. He's probably making fun of Japanese culture. Every comment was a small cut, but I kept my mouth shut. Yuki tried including me, switching languages, looking frustrated as conversations kept drifting to rapid Japanese that shut me out. Then her dad talked to Yuki's brother like I was invisible, he said, this is what happens when daughters go to universities. They bring home gaijin who will never understand us. Yuki WA hontoni bakada, the brother replied. Yuki is truly being stupid dating someone who doesn't speak our language. How can there be real love without communication? My jaw clenched. Canno jabun nojise WA munaishi iro keco added, she's wasting her life on someone who can't even talk to her family. My chest burned. I taken insults about my appearance, my manners, my culture. But calling Yuki stupid for loving someone, that crossed every line. Then.

Oh my gosh. Was your face red? I didn't know what to say. And she just jumped right back into her meal. And after a few minutes, she noticed and she thought I didn't like it.

So I treated her exactly like I treat my other friends. With boundaries. Tara and I had been together for two years, living together, for one. We were talking about future plans, her sister's wedding next summer, where I was supposed to be her plus one. Then on a random Thursday evening, she sat me down for the talk. I love you, but I'm not in love with you anymore. She. I think we should transition to being friends. We get along so well, have the same friend group. We'd make amazing friends. But not amazing partners. Here's what killed me. She said all this while already having packed a bag. Her friend Marissa was picking her up in an hour. She planned this whole thing down to having somewhere to stay, already got an exit strategy. I said, we're adults. We're friends. We can make this work. I sat there processing. Two years living together, talking about kids someday. Now she wants to be buddies? Okay. I said, yeah, let's be friends. She actually smiled, relieved, like I just agreed to her perfect plan where she gets to dump me but keep all the benefits of having me in her life. The next morning, I did exactly what Tara asked. Treated her like a friend. That's when I Learned she had a very different definition of friendship than I did. First text came at 7:00am. Could you drop Off my work laptop? Sure. I'll leave it at the front desk of your office Monday. Can't you bring it by Marissa's? I need it for the weekend. I've got plans. Monday works better. She didn't like that.

My dad showed up at my apartment with flowers for me like I was his girlfriend. And my fiance had to tell him he was my father, not my husband. I always knew my dad was weird about me. When my parents divorced when I was 9, my mom moved on pretty quick, found herself a nice guy named Paul who treated me like a normal stepdaughter. But my dad, he never dated anyone, ever. He'd always say I was his whole world and he didn't need anyone else. At first, it felt special. He'd pick me up from school with my favourite candy. He'd take me shopping and let me get whatever I wanted. He called our Saturday Hangouts daddy daughter dates, which seemed normal enough when I was 10. But things got weird as I got older. When I started wearing makeup in eighth grade, he threw it all away and said I was too beautiful to need that garbage. When I got my first phone, he demanded all my passwords because he needed to protect me from predators. He'd scroll through my texts every night at dinner. High school was worse. He hated all my friends, especially the guys. If I hung out with anyone he didn't approve of, he'd give me the silent treatment for days, just sit at dinner staring at his plate, acting like I didn't exist until I Apologized. The worst was when I told him I was dating Trevor when I was 17. We were driving to target and I casually mentioned I had a boyfriend. He pulled into the parking lot and just started crying, like ugly sobbing. He said I was throwing away everything we had together for some stupid boy who didn't really know me. I felt so guilty. I broke up with Trevor the next week. College gave me some space, but he'd call me three times a day. If I didn't answer, he'd drive the two hours to campus to make sure I was okay. My roommate thought it was sweet at first until she saw him show up at 1:00am because I'd fallen asleep without texting him good night. After graduation, I moved to my own apartment and met Malik at my job. He was calm.

Is Daisy Williams present in school today? My teacher, Missus Harrah, clicked the intercom button. Yes, the principal's voice echoed. Lockdown now. This is not a drill. The way he said it made my blood freeze. Missus Harrah shrieked under the desks. Lights off. Move, move, move. Nobody said anything, but everyone was thinking the same thing. There was a shooter. I couldn't help but think he was after me. A few minutes later, we heard sirens and then screaming. Missus Harrah tried to calm us down and told us it might be a misunderstanding, but her hands were shaking. She kept refreshing the email on her laptop like it was giving her live updates. The screaming got louder and it wasn't just one voice anymore. Multiple people in different parts of the building. Then we heard a loud pop from the hallway, like a metal slamming or something crashing hard. People started crying and whispering that the shooter was right outside and I believed them. Pia grabbed my hand and her palms were soaked with sweat. I could see Mister Kids class across the hall through our door window. Lights already off, no movement, just darkness where 20 kids should have been. I looked at our teacher and for the first time in my life, I saw her cry. She sat with us, hugged the younger kids and told us it would be okay. But after a while, She got up again and walked back to her laptop. Then we heard it, footsteps running past our door. Thud, thud, thud. I couldn't help myself. I had to look. Two paramedics were sprinting down the hall, pushing a wheeled stretcher, the kind you see on medical shows when someone's heart stops away from the door. Daisy, Missus Harrah whispered, voice shaking. She was scared, too. I sat down and immediately texted everyone what I had seen. Even Missus Harrah stood up slowly and crept to the door to check the window before opening it. That's when it flung open. The principal stood there with an actual cop who had his hand resting on his gun. You, Daisy, come with us. Immediately, my worst fear confirmed. The shooter had sent them or maybe they thought I was involved somehow. Missus Harra looked between them and me, confused. Get your things, honey, Missus Harra said. And that scared me more than anything because in three years of chemistry class, she'd never called me honey. Every single person was staring at me as I grabbed my backpack with shaking hands. The hallway was complete chaos. More cops than I'd ever seen in one place. I heard a paramedic shout, we're losing him. Move as he flew past us. My classmates were pressed against the door windows in every room watching me get us.

I pointed it out and he got so flustered, mumbling something about laundry. Then he looked at me totally serious and said, are you gonna cancel the date now? Like a nervous middle schooler, I fell for him right there, socks and all. Two, we were at the arcade and he got way too invested in the claw machine, not for himself, but because he saw a stuffed turtle. He said, look like me when I'm cranky. It took him six tries, 20 bucks and some serious trash talk to the machine, but he got it when he handed it to me. He said, now you can hold me when I'm not around. That turtle's still on my bed. 3, he doesn't know how to cook at all. But one night I was sick and he showed up with instant noodles, gummy bears and a handwritten get well card drawn in blue pen. He spelled fever wrong, but he also drew me as a superhero, complete with a cape and a little speech bubble that said, I got this. I swear I got better instantly. He made me a playlist titled Songs That Remind Me of You and forgot to check the shuffle setting. First song was Shrek 2 soundtrack. I asked if it was a joke. He panicked and said, no, it's romantic. He really loved her. Five, he tied my shoelace because it came undone and said, safety first, princess, like he was a knight or something. I giggled and he turned red. 6, I caught him flexing in the mirror when he thought I wasn't looking. He whispered, she likes strong arms to himself. I had to pretend I didn't hear so he wouldn't die of embarrassment. 7, we walked past a Lego store and he stopped mid sentence, gasped and said, can we please go in just for a minute? Thirty minutes later, he was building a tiny pirate ship and explaining the lore of each mini figure. Eight, he named a raccoon that lives near his apartment. Captain bites and leaves snacks for it. Every time it shows up, he waves like it's a neighbor. First time I saw it, he said, look, he came.

Somebody I know? Mm hmm. A girl named Tina. You went on a date with Tina a little while ago? Yeah. Yeah, I did. Okay, um, well, we do a thing on our show called The Second Date Update, where if someone goes on a. On a date with someone, things don't go exactly as planned. She emailed us about you. About me?

Prematurely. I mean. What do you mean? Okay, is there anything that happened when you guys were making out that you were embarrassed about?

You mean the emergency backup onesie my baby wore after she had a poop explosion? Yes, it was pastel. It was against the rules. She is 7 months old. I'm pretty sure she doesn't know what dress code means. I specifically said dark colors for everyone. Are you suggesting my baby purposely sabotaged your wedding theme? I don't know, but the fact is she was wearing a light color during my moment. It was pink, not white, not sparkling, not covered in Swarovski crystals. Just pink. And she's shaped like a potato. A very noticeable potato. She can't walk, she can't talk, she can't even sit properly. She literally just drools and occasionally screams at ceiling fans. You could have brought a spare dress. I'm pregnant. I was too busy waddling, throwing up, and not passing out to double check a 7 month old's goth outfit rotation. Your husband could have done it. He packed the pink dress. He thought a baby wasn't part of the sacred white colour only threat protocol. Well, he was wrong. This was my day and that was her diaper explosion. We all suffered. You're missing the point. The photos. She was in the frame during my vows wearing pink. She was asleep. Her face was mashed into my chest. The only thing visible in the photo is the top of her fuzzy head and one baby sock. I saw the pink. Guests saw the pink. People will think I allowed pink. People will talk about what? The baby's fashion crimes. Breaking infant disrespectfully fails to read invite. Don't be sarcastic. This was the biggest day of my life, and my baby pooped in honor of it. Sincerely? Repeatedly. You should feel flattered. I just can't believe you'd let this happen. I feel so disrespected. She can't even hold a spoon. But okay, sure. She's a white dress wearing sabatour from the toddler underworld. I'm serious. I might crop her out of every picture. She would. Thank you. She didn't even want to be there. She's a baby. She wanted to eat her own foot and nap in peace. You owe me an apology. I'll send it in glittery pink from her.

The bell rang for 10 minutes before going silent. I broke through the dirt wall. Between us, a girl named Marisol fell into my tunnel, gasping and crying. She was only 15. Her parents buried her early because they'd caught her writing love letters. We spent 18 hours underground together. I shared my supplies, taught her the breathing exercises, kept her calm. When panic set in, we whispered about lives. We'd never get to live if we died down here. When they dug us up, they expected two broken girls. Instead, we crawled out, holding hands, filthy but furious. The crowd gasped. Two girls in one hole. Both alive, both unbroken. My mother's face went white when she saw Marisol. The elders immediately started shouting about tradition being violated, about how we cheated the ritual. My father grabbed my arm, hissing that I'd humiliated our bloodstream. But I wasn't done. In front of the entire village, I told them about the tunnel, about the girl whose bell they ignored. About the real tradition. Letting daughters die to create submissive wife. The elders called an emergency meeting. That night, my parents locked me in my room while they attended. Through my window, I could hear shouting from the community center. My mother came home sobbing, my father silent with. The next morning, they tried to bury me again. My father and three uncles dragged me from bed. My mother packed a second coffin with no water. This time, the Elders declared I needed a true burial, since I'd corrupted the first one. But Marisol had talked to her family, refused to participate. Three other families pulled their daughters from upcoming ceremonies. The photographer who'd been hired to document my burial for our family album caught everything. The forced second attempt, my screaming, my mother's dead eyes as she watched. He sent it to new stations that night. By the time they'd forced me into the second coffin, reporters were already driving to our village. They pulled me out after three hours when the first news van arrived. Tradition died in the flash of camera lights and the questions they couldn't answer about dead daughters. My family disowned me completely. They held a real funeral, buried an empty coffin with my name on it. They tell people I died in the first box. That what came out was a demon wearing my face. My mother burns sage when she sees me in the market. My father spits on the ground. But my sister Paloma won't be buried. Neither will Marisol's cousins or any other girl in our village.

You ever get betrayed so bad it doesn't just hurt, it rewrites you. That was me. My ex best friend Eli stabbed me in the back in a way I still don't fully understand. We've been close since we were kids, shared everything, laughed until our stomachs hurt. I thought we were brothers. Then senior year came around and I found out he'd been using me. Not in the he copied my homework way. No, this was deeper. He took everything I told him in confidence about my anxiety, my insecurities, my family stuff, my parents messy divorce and used it to build clout with a group of people I thought hated me. Turned my personal life into a punchline. I confronted him and he just smirked and said, grow a thicker skin, dude. It's just jokes. That night I decided to become someone else. It started off stupid. I wanted revenge. Nothing deep, just enough to embarrass him. I made a fake profile of a girl and named her J. It started off small, like turning my pictures into a female version, setting up a fake Instagram. My plan was simple, get him to say some pathetic flirty stuff and then leak it to the school. But Eli fell fast, faster than I expected. And the more he fell, the more I leaned in. What was at first meant to be a two Week job quickly turned full time. By week three, I was using a voice changer to call him. He'd call me every night before bed. Obviously I needed some compensation, so he'd cash app me 10 bucks every call. He'd say stuff like I've never felt this comfortable with anyone. He opened up in ways I'd never seen before. The way he talked to her, the way he needed her. And I started to realize something. He never respected me, but this version of me, this soft voiced, smiling, wide eyed girl from a few towns over, he worshipped her. What started as a joke stretched into weeks, then months. I'd spend hours each day crafting conversations, sinking voice filters, sending selfies, managing multiple burner accounts. I created playlists, family stories, fake college plans. I Learned everything about his insecurities, his fear of being alone, of not being good enough, of being forgotten. And I used all of it. A year in, I realized I'd gone too far. This wasn't revenge anymore. This was something else. I wasn't just catfishing him. I was breaking him and myself slowly and quietly. But the worst part was that I didn't stop. That's when the real revenge started. Jade became distant.

Oh, honey, let me tell you about the time my daughter didn't talk to me for two whole weeks because I betrayed her trust over a damn chicken nugget. So my daughter Lila, she's 14, has the attitude of a Beverly Hills housewife and the budget of a toddler. This girl acts like she's the CEO of the household. Tells me things like, mom, please don't embarrass me in front of my friends. Just stand still and blink like, ma'am, you live in my uterus rent free for nine months. Show some respect. Anyway, she decides she's going vegan. Great. I support her. I buy tofu, almond milk, overpriced plant nuggets that taste like regret. The whole shebang. Do I understand it? No, but I'm a supportive queen. But then one night, it's 1:00am, I'm watching reality TV in the dark, and I get hungry. I open the freezer and see those dino shaped chicken nuggets she begged for last year and never ate. So I pop, like, four in the air fryer. I'm minding my business, living my best life, and guess what? I forget to hide the evidence. Next morning, she walks into the kitchen, sniffs the air like a bloodhound, and goes, did you eat meat in this house? I said, uh, maybe. She gasps like, I just committed war crimes. You ate dead animals while I was sleeping? I said, baby girl, they were shaped like dinosaurs. They're barely meat. Calm down. She grabs her reusable water bottle, slams it on the counter, and yells, this is why the planet's dying, Because of people like you who can't control their midnight cravings! I said, okay, Greta Thunberg, relax. She storms off to her room and text me from down the hall, we're not speaking. This is a betrayal. I text back, fine, more dino nuggets for me. She leaves me on read y'all. Two weeks he wouldn't speak to me. Not even when I stubbed my toe and screamed so loud the neighbours checked on me. She just walked past me with her Hydro flask and judgmental aura. But then get this. One day I come home early from work, I walk into the kitchen, and there she is, standing in front of the microwave holding a plate with three dino nuggets. She's caught mid bite. We lock eyes. Time freezes. She goes, they don't count if they're Dinosaur shaped. I said, excuse me? She wipes her mouth like a criminal and goes, don't tell dad. I said, oh, I'm telling everyone. She bribes me with her leftover Starbucks gift card and begs for mercy. I post the photo in our family group chat anyway. Caption our little activist caught mid murder her grandpa.

It started about six months ago. Every argument, every little thing that didn't go her way, slam. Every time I asked her to do dishes, slam. When I told her she couldn't go to some party where I knew they'd be drinking, slam! The sound would shake the whole upstairs. My coffee mug fell off my nightstand twice from the vibrations. My husband Dave, kept telling me to ignore it. He'd say, kids go through phases. She'll grow out of it. Easy for him to say, since he's usually at work when most of the slamming happens. I'm the one working from home, trying to take client calls while slam! Echoes through the house. The breaking point came on a Tuesday. Emma wanted to borrow my car to drive to her friend Jesse's house. I said no because she got a speeding ticket the week before, and we agreed her driving privileges were suspended. She started screaming about how unfair I was, how I never trust her, how all her friends think I'm psycho. Then she stomped upstairs and slam! But this time was different. This time I heard something crack. Went up to check, and there was a split running down the door frame. The wood was actually damaged. That door had been slammed so hard and so many times that it was breaking the house. I stood there staring at that crack, and something just snapped. In me, I marched to the garage, grabbed Dave's screwdriver set, and went back upstairs. Emma was inside her room blasting music, probably expecting me to yell at her through the door like usual. Instead, I started unscrewing the hinges. It took me about 10 minutes. Emma didn't even notice until I was lifting the door off the frame. Then her music stopped real quick. Mom, what are you doing? She called out. Solving a problem, said carrying her door downstairs to the garage. She appeared at the top of the stairs in her pajamas, mouth hanging open. You can't take my door. I need privacy. You lost your privileges when you damaged the house, I told her. Privacy is earned, not guaranteed. The next few days were interesting. Emma tried everything. She hung a bed sheet across the doorway, which I took down. She moved her dresser to block the opening, so I moved it back. While she was at school, she even tried staying at her friend's house. Jess's mom called me asking what was going on. By day four, Emma was sitting on her bed when I got home from the grocery store. No music, no phone. Just sitting there. This is embarrassing. She. What if someone comes over? Then maybe you'll think twice before destroying property. I said I wasn't destroying anything. I was just mad. The door frame says otherwise. That's when she actually looked at the crack she'd made. I could see her face. Change. When she realised she'd actually damaged something. Day seven was when things got real. Emma's boyfriend Tyler came over to work on some school project. I watched from the kitchen as he walked upstairs, expecting to go into her room and

Step 3 Roblox wrecking ball. I made a new game just for him. Private server, custom map. Looked like his childhood bedroom, except the walls bled and every NPC whispered give it back Ethan! Even his Avatar looked like him, but melting. He joined, lasted 13 seconds before logging out. Blocked me, but I had already planted something special. Step 4 real life payload. I emailed his church.

I hated the idea of my 17 year old daughter dating anyone. But when she brought home this boy named Pete, I lost it. He had a motorcycle, tattoos and that smug smile that made me want to run his name through the system. I made it my mission to break them up. I'd randomly show up at places they hung out, flash my badge around and remind Pete that I knew how to make bodies disappear. But this kid never flinched. He just smile and say, have a good day, sir. When he came for dinner the first time, I placed my gun on the table next to my plate. My wife kicked me under the table but I didn't care. Pete just looked at it and said, Nice Glock 19, sir. My uncle's got the same one at his security firm. That's when the real torture began. I started making him come over every weekend to bond. I'd have him help me with the most backbreaking chores I could think of. Reshaping the roof in July, digging out a tree stump by hand, moving every piece of furniture in the house to steam clean the carpets. This kid never complained. He'd show up at 7:00am sharp already wearing work clothes, even brought his own work gloves. When I try to wear him down with endless tasks, he just say what's next? Sir, one Saturday I had him helping me rebuild the deck. I was being extra harsh, making him redo boards that were perfectly fine. Around noon, my daughter brought us water. As she walked away, I caught Pete watching her. But it wasn't the way most teenage boys looked at girls. He had this soft.

At group dinners, she'd hijack any conversation within five minutes. I couldn't stand her, but I put up with it because she and Zach had been friends since college. After my husband and I announced our pregnancy at 12 weeks, things with Kate got really weird. Suddenly, Kate was everywhere we went sporting a small baby bump. She showed up at our favorite brunch spot rubbing her belly. She enrolled in our exact prenatal yoga class. She even switched to our OB practice. Nobody questioned it because these things happen and women get pregnant. At the same time, she posted weekly bump photos on Instagram and everyone congratulated her just like they did me. Three months in, one of our friends mentioned something strange at a girl's night. She said Kate's belly looked bigger the previous Tuesday at Book Club than it did at Saturday's barbecue. When she brought it up, Kate burst into tears about how cruel it was to comment on a pregnant woman's body. She went on about water retention and bloating and how pregnant women deal with enough judgment without their friends piling on. Our friend felt terrible and apologized profusely while the rest of us comforted Kate. After that night, nobody dared mention anything about her appearance again, even, even though I Started noticing her bump size seemed to fluctuate, too. That's when things got uncomfortable.

Then the jokes got stranger, like when she said pregnancy brain made her forget exactly when she conceived. And wasn't it funny how close our due dates were? She started showing up at every single appointment Zach and I had. Always in the waiting room when we arrived. Claiming her appointment was right before or after hours during our maternity photo shoot at the park, she appeared with her own photographer, saying what a coincidence that she'd booked the same spot.

So I treated her exactly like I treat my other friends, with boundaries. Tara and I had been together for two years, living together for one. We were talking about future plans, her sister's wedding next summer where I was supposed to be her plus 1. Then on a random Thursday evening, she sat me down for the talk. I love you, but I'm not in love with you anymore. She said, I think we should transition to being friends, get along so well, have the same friend group. We'd make amazing friends but not amazing partners. Here's what killed me, she said. All this while already having packed a bag. Her friend Marissa was picking her up in an hour. She planned this whole thing down to having somewhere to stay already got an exit strategy. I said, we're adults, we're friends. We can make this work. I sat there processing two years living together, talking about kids someday. Now she wants to be buddies. Okay, I said, yeah, let's be friends. She actually smiled, relieved, like I just agreed to her perfect plan where she gets to dump me but keep all the benefits of having me in her life. The next morning, I did exactly what Tara asked, treated her like a friend. That's when I Learned she had a very different definition of friendship than I did. First text came at 7:00am. Could you drop Off my work laptop. Sure. I'll leave it at the front desk of your office Monday. Can't you bring it by Marissa's? I need it for the weekend. I've got plans. Monday works better. She didn't like that.

I'll go first. My dad always told me, ever since I could remember, sweetheart, never trust a man who butters his toast all the way to the edges. It was so specific, so weird, that it just became a family joke. We never knew where he got it from. He'd just say it with a completely straight face over breakfast. For 20 years. It was just a funny thing my quirky dad said. Then I met Mark. Mark was perfect. I don't mean, oh, he's great perfect. I mean, he seemed like he was built in a lab to be the ideal boyfriend. He remembered the name of my childhood dog after I mentioned it. Once he Learned how to cook my favourite meal from my grandma's recipe. My friends loved him. My mom adored him. We dated for a year, and it was flawless. We decided to move in together, and I felt like the luckiest person alive. The first Saturday we were in our new apartment, I was making coffee and he was making breakfast. I looked over and he was at the counter carefully buttering a piece of toast. He held it with such focus, spreading the butter in smooth, even strokes. And he went all the way to the absolute final millimeter of the crust. Every single edge was perfectly covered. A little alarm. My dad's voice went off in

He's sweating so bad it's dripping on our test papers and he keeps checking his phone every few seconds. I look for our teacher, but she left to make copies 10 minutes ago and never came back. The man doesn't even say his name, just stares at all of us breathing heavily and then asks really loud whose parents work in the downtown offices, you know, the big buildings. Nobody raises their hand because we all know about stranger danger and this guy seems dangerous. He gets mad and his face goes from red to almost purple. He yells, I know some of you have parents there. This is important. Finally, me and four other kids slowly raise our hands because maybe something happened to our parents and he needs to tell us. He points at us and says, you 5, stay after the bell rings. Everyone else, leave as fast as you can. The girl next to me grabs my wrist and whispers, run with me, but my legs won't move. What if my mom needs me and this man is supposed to take me to her? The bell rings and everyone practically runs out like the rooms on fire. The man locks the door behind them with this loud click and my stomach drops like on a roller coaster. He won't even let us near our backpacks where our phones are. The Quiet girl starts crying and he doesn't even care, just keeps checking the window. Then his watch saying 15 minutes. We wait 15 minutes, which makes no sense because our parents usually pick us up in 5 minutes. The classroom phone rings and he rips it from the wall, like actually rips it out and throws it in the trash. And now I'm really scared because why would he do that unless he's kidnapping us? We hear sirens outside, lots of them getting louder. He stands in front of the door, blocking it with his whole body. The football player kid who's bigger than some teachers rushes the door. The man catches him with one hand. It didn't take him any effort to stop the biggest of us. He keeps saying no calls, not yet. Your parents can't know you're here. And those sirens aren't for us. They're connected. I think maybe he did something bad downtown where our parents work. Maybe we're hostages. The room smells like his sweat now, sour and wrong. The principal's voice crackles on the intercom saying all students proceed to evacuation positions immediately. But the man doesn't move from the door. We hear hundreds of feet running in the hallways, doors slamming, teachers yelling. There were more sirens than I've ever heard before. Like every fire truck and ambulance in the city is coming here. The quiet girl throws up on her desk from being so scared. He tosses her his jacket to clean Up. And when he does, I see he has an empty gum holster under his arm, which makes me almost scream, but I cover my mouth. Teachers are banging on our door, yelling to open up. But he yells back, official emergency protocol, these students are accounted for. And keeps mumbling as he checks the time, 12 minutes, 11 minutes, 10 minutes, like he's counting down to something bad. I can hear my phone in my backpack buzzing with texts, probably from my mom, but he won't let me check. Please, I beg him. Is my mom okay? They don't understand, he keeps saying. Sweat dripping off his chin. If you leave now, you'll walk right into it. But he won't tell us what it is. His phone rings. He fumbles it, accidentally hitting speaker. The person on the phone says chemical cloud has passed the school perimeter. Downtown sector is sealed. We all freeze. He's still blocking the door. Why isn't he letting us go? Another voice cuts in. Confirm, guard.

My chemistry teacher, Mr Santiago, had one rule that everyone knew, absolutely no phones during lab experiments, period. He confiscated dozens that semester. So when mine started buzzing non stop during our titration lab, the entire class froze. Everyone watched as Mr Santiago marched across the room, his face set in that familiar owl. Hand it over, Daniel, he said, extending his palm. But when he glanced at my screen, his expression completely changed. His face went white. Dad's in the er. Come now, Mom. 23 missed calls, 12 voicemails. The whole class went dead silent. Mister Santiago stared at the phone, then looked at me with something I'd never seen before, pure understanding. Pack up your stuff right now, he said quietly. But Mister Santiago, you can't leave school during pack your stuff. He grabbed his car keys from his desk drawer, turned to the class, said, read Chapter 12, take notes, I'll be back. Alyssa raised her hand, but what about the lab? Clean up your stations. The lab can wait. We bolted down the empty hallway. In the parking lot, he unlocked his up Honda Civic and we jumped in. The second we hit the main road, he floored it. 60 in a 35, 80 in a 55. My father had a massive heart attack when I was 17, he said, knuckles white on the steering wheel. I was in algebra class, asked to leave three times. He ran a Red light. My teacher said the test was more important than my family. Drama wouldn't let me go. We screeched around a corner. He died while I sat there solving for X. Pulled into the hospital parking lot on two wheels, I ran inside, found my mom sobbing in the waiting room. Dad was stable. Bad fall off a ladder, broken ribs, but alive. How did you get here so fast? Mom asked. I looked back through the glass doors. Mr Santiago was already gone. Monday morning, I walked into chemistry expecting everything to be normal. But Principal Dalton was standing at the front of the classroom, arms crossed. Mr Santiago, he said coldly, my office now. The whole class exchange change glances. We all knew why. 20 minutes later, Mister Santiago returned looking grim. As soon as Principal Dalton left, Alyssa shot up from her seat. Someone snitched, she announced. Dalton knows you left campus. What did you tell him? Ethan asked. Mister Santiago shrugged. The truth that I violated district policy by leaving during class hours. Riley gasped. Are you getting fired? Probably suspended, maybe worse. That's when Alyssa did something incredible. She stood up, cleared her throat and said in a loud voice, Mister Santiago, I need to report a medical emergency. We all stared at her. Friday during lab, half the class got severe food poisoning. You had no choice but to escort us to the nurse's office, remember? Understanding dawned on Ethan's face. Oh, yeah. He said, clutching his stomach dramatically. Worst stomach bug of my life, definitely food poisoning, Riley added. Had to leave immediately. Could barely walk, said Jaden. Life threatening situation, said Madison. One by one, every single student in that class backed up Alyssa's story, even kids who usually hated Mister Santiago, even the ones who'd failed his tests. 28 students, same exact story, straight faces. When Principal Dalton returned an hour later to investigate the incident, he interviewed six random students. Food poisoning, said the first. Emergency situation, said the second. Mister Santiago saved our lives, said the third. Dalton looked increasingly frustrated, so none of you saw Mister Santiago leave campus for any other reason? What other.

My parents were so worried about me dating a skater boy, they couldn't imagine he'd be the reason I'm still alive today. A few nights ago, my parents found out about my skater boyfriend, Greg, when his message popped up on my screen at dinner. I love you, too. Who the heck are you talking to? My mom shouted, glaring at the screen of my phone. You're 14. No dating until you're 30. We were very clear. Dad pulled up Reg's Instagram on his own phone. Skateboarder? Really? This is who you're risking your future for? I tried to reason with them, but they refused to listen and forced me to block him everywhere, right there, over dinner. You'll thank us when you're in college, mom said. While I stopped, my friends tried passing messages between us at school, but my parents found out and threatened to call their parents. Eventually, everyone gave up, except for Greggus. Greggus showed up mysteriously in my valorant lobby. Hey, Mel. It's been a while, he said, his voice breaking. I miss you, Mel. I know we're not supposed to talk, but let's at least play like we used to. We started meeting in the lobbies every day after that, just playing and chatting about normal things. School, old friends, my strict parents. He never once tried to convince me to sneak around or meet up in person. He never complained. About my parents or tried to turn me against them. When I vent about how unfair they were being, he'd actually defend them. Sometimes they're just scared, Once my older sister got mixed up with some bad people in high school. Parents get paranoid. He still cared about me in all the ways that mattered. When I failed my chemistry test because I couldn't focus, he spent three hours teaching me balancing equations over discord. When my grandmother got sick, he stayed up until 3:00am just listening to me cry. You can always reach me here, he promised. I don't care what time it is. Mom almost caught us once when she walked by while discord was open. I clicked my game lobby just in time. Homework break? She asked. I nodded and switched back to my essay, my heart pounding so hard I thought she'd hear it after she left Greg's message. Maybe we should stop. I don't want to get you in trouble. But I couldn't lose him again. He was the only person who I could rely on. And thank god I didn't lose him, because a couple of days later, my friend Sarah and I got caught up in some shady business. It was supposed to be a normal Saturday night sleepover. Her parents went out for their anniversary, leaving us to watch movies and eat junk food. I was on the phone messaging greatest on discord when Sarah's older brother Joshua came home. From college, completely wasted with two other friends, Sarah immediately tensed up. baby sis and baby girl, he winked disgustingly. He and his friends sat beside us on the sofa, placing his arm over my shoulder, constantly whispering things like, I know you're not as innocent as you act, and your parents don't have to know. I pushed his face away and stood up, glaring. Can you stop? Sarah was almost crying, begging me not to make him mad. He gets mean when he's drunk, she whispered. Just ignore him and he'll pass out soon. But when Joshua grabbed my waist and tried to pull me onto his lap, I grabbed Sarah's arm and ran to the bathroom. Quickly locking the door, he started pounding on it, laughing with his friends about how I was playing hard to get and needed to loosen up. Sarah hopped into the tub, hugging her knees to her chest. I patted my pockets, realizing I had left my phone in the living room. Soon the knocks on the door became angrier. Hitting the door harder, jiggling the handle aggressively, Sarah meekly handed me her phone.

I went shopping alone, bought myself the exact dress I'd shown him, got my nails done, and treated myself to dinner at this fancy Italian place downtown. The waiter even brought me free cake when I mentioned it was my birthday. For the next month, every time Danny mentioned his upcoming birthday, I played dumb. When he showed me golf clubs online and said these would be perfect for my birthday, I just said cool and kept folding laundry. When he asked what restaurant we should book for his birthday dinner, I told him I hadn't really thought about it. When he mentioned taking the day off work to celebrate, I said that sounded nice and changed the subject. March 14th arrived. I woke up early, got dressed for work like any normal day, and started making coffee. Danny came downstairs in his favorite shirt, clearly expecting something special. Morning, I said, not looking up from my phone. It's my birthday, he said, waiting for my reaction. I looked up, pretended to think for a second, then snapped my fingers. Oh yeah! Happy birthday, babe. Have a good day at work. His face went through about five different emotions. Confusion, hurt, anger, then this weird panic. That's it? You're not taking the day off? We don't have dinner plans? I shrugged, grabbing my keys. I've been super busy with work stuff lately. Haven't really had time to plan anything. When I got home that night, he was sitting at the kitchen table looking defeated. You really forgot my birthday, he said quietly. I didn't forget, I replied. I just figured if birthdays aren't important enough to remember without reminders, then maybe we shouldn't make such a big deal about them. The realization hit him like a truck. His mouth opened and closed a few times before he finally said, this is about your birthday, isn't it? What about my birthday? I asked innocently. He put his head in his hands. I've been a complete idiot. Yeah, I said, you have been. The next morning I woke up to rose petals leading from our bedroom to the kitchen, where he'd made my favourite breakfast and had a jewellery box sitting next to my coffee. Inside was a necklace that looked exactly like my mom's missing one. I know I can't undo the past three years, he said, but I swear I will never forget again.

The principal called my name over the intercom. Is Daisy Williams present in school today? My teacher, Missus Harra, clicked the intercom button. Yes. The principal's voice echoed, lockdown, now! This is not a drill. The way he said it made my blood freeze. Missus Harra shrieked under the desks. Lights off! Move, move, move! Nobody said anything, but everyone was thinking the same thing. There was a shooter. I couldn't help but think he was after me. A few minutes later, we heard sirens and then screaming. Missus Harra tried to calm us down and told us it might be a misunderstanding, but her hands were shaking. She kept refreshing the email on her laptop like it was giving her live updates. The screaming got louder, and it wasn't just one voice anymore. Multiple people in different parts of the building. Then we heard a loud pop from the hallway, like a metal slamming or something crashing hard. People started crying and whispering that the shooter was right outside. And I believe them. Pia grabbed my hand, and her palms were soaked with sweat. I could see Mister Kids class across the hall through our door window. Lights already off. No movement. Just darkness. Where 20 kids should have been. I looked at our teacher, and for the first time in my life, I saw her cry. She sat with us, hugged the younger kids, and told us it would be okay. But after a while, she Got up again and walked back to her laptop. Then we heard it. Footsteps running past our door. Thud! Thud, thud! I couldn't help myself. I had to look. Two paramedics were sprinting down the hall, pushing a wheeled stretcher. Kind you see on medical shows when someone's heart stops. Get away from the door, Daisy! Missus Harris whispered, voice shaking. She was scared, too. I sat down and immediately texted everyone what I had seen. Even missus Harris stood up slowly and crept to the OR to check the window before opening it. That's when it flung open. The principal stood there with an actual cop who had his hand resting on his gun. You, Daisy, come with us. Immediately my worst fear confirmed. The she had sent them. Or maybe they thought I was involved somehow. Missus Harra looked between them and me, confused. Get your things, honey, missus Harra said. And that scared me more than anything, because in three years of chemistry class, she'd never called me honey. Every single person was staring at me as I grabbed my backpack with shaking hands. The hallway was complete chaos, more cops than I'd ever seen. In one place, I. I heard a paramedic shout, we're losing him! Move! As he flew past us. My classmates were pressed against the door windows in every room, watching me get escorted by police like I was a criminal. They steered me to the main office, but passed reception into the Conference room. The cop finally spoke. Your dad is here? Well, my parents are divorced, and I haven't seen him since I was seven. So now I was really confused. He grabbed me in a hug so tight, I couldn't breathe, and his whole body shook against mine. I'm so sorry, baby. I'm so sorry. My ex marine father, who always encouraged me to be stoic and suppress my feelings, was crying his eyes out. Sorry for what? What's happening? Is there a shooter? Are people dead? I pulled back to look at him, and he held my face in both hands. His hands were freezing. There's no

Jess came over to my place Friday night, and I could tell something was bothering her by the way she kept sighing. You know what Britney told me today? She said, flopping down on my couch, her boyfriend is so mysterious, and she's obsessed with him. Meanwhile, you texted me 12 times about being nervous for your presentation. The way she said it made me feel like I was some kind of burden. I wish you were more mysterious, more of a challenge. I should have known this would end badly when three weeks later, she'd be crying at my door. But that night, I just felt hurt and said, fine, I'll be mysterious. That night. I usually would have texted her good night, but I didn't, and it felt wrong not doing it. She sent me three question marks right away, and I just wrote back, all good, and left it at that. Saturday morning came, and normally I'd text her about my coffee and ask what she was up to, but I kept my phone in my pocket. By noon, she would texting, you okay? And I just sent a thumbs up, which killed me because I actually wanted to talk to her. Monday was the worst because I got the promotion I've been working for, and all I wanted was to call her. And when we went to dinner that night, She asked about my day, and I just said, same old while scrolling through my phone, even though inside I was bursting to tell her. She leaned across the table trying to figure out what was going on with me. You seem different, she said. Good. Different. And the crazy part was she seemed more into me than she had in months. Made me feel powerful, but also completely hollow inside. The second week, she started showing up at my place without calling first and cooking these fancy dinners, basically doing anything to crack me open. I can't figure you out anymore, she said. Wednesday night, and she sounded excited about it. Britney so jealous, she says. I got the mysterious boyfriend. Jackpot! I wanted to tell her how dumb this whole thing was and how much I missed just talking to her normally, but I just shrugged and kept watching TV. my dad called because my mom was in the hospital for minor surgery and he was freaking out. I spent three hours calming him down while Jess sat next to me trying to figure out what was happening. After I hung up, she asked, is everything okay? And I wanted to fall into her arms and tell her everything. Family stuff. I said instead, it's handled. She kissed me harder than she had in months and whispered, you're so strong.

The school called me during a client meeting. Your daughter won't stop crying. We need you here now. My stomach dropped. Maya never cried at school. She was my tough girl who scraped her knee last month and asked for a Spider Man Band Aid while blood ran down her leg. I left my presentation half finished and drove like the world was ending. The secretary's face was pale when I walked in. She pointed down the hall without speaking. That scared me more than the phone call. Maya sat curled in the corner of the nurse's office, arms wrapped around her knees. Her favorite purple dress was torn at the shoulder. The butterfly hair clips I'd put in that morning were gone. When I touched her arm, she jerked away like I was made of electricity. Baby, what happened? Whispered. She wouldn't look at me, just kept staring at the wall with empty eyes. The nurse shifted uncomfortably and told me Maya hadn't said a word since PE class ended. Missus Johnson brought her in like this. I took Maya home. She sat in the back seat, not her usual spot next to me. That night she wouldn't eat her favorite Mac and cheese, wouldn't watch cartoons, just sat on her bed holding her stuffed elephant while helping her into pajamas. I saw them finger shaped bruises on her upper arms, dark purple marks where someone had grabbed her hard. My Hands shook. Maya, who did this? She finally looked at me. Her voice came out so small. Mister Garcia said, if I tell, he'll hurt you. He said, nobody believes little girls anyway. Mister Garcia, the P E. Teacher parents loved because he coached the winning soccer team, the one who high fived kids in the hallway, who'd been teaching for 15 years. I called 9 1 1 that night. The female officer who interviewed Maya was gentle, patient. Maya told her everything, how Mister Garcia took her to the equipment room during class, how he made her play a secret game, how it hurt, how he did it to other girls, too, during their special practice time. The principal called me at 6:00am not to apologize, to scold me. He said I should have come to him first, that calling police was premature, that Mister Garcia was a valued member of their community. I recorded the entire call.

My brother and I used to sneak out all the time. Not for anything wild, just dumb, harmless stuff. Late night 7 11 runs, laying on the trampoline to watch for meteors. One time we snuck out just to see if the new Taco Bell was open 24 hours. We weren't rebels, just bored kids who liked feeling like we were getting away with something. Something. It started when I was 11 and he was 14. He'd tap three times on my wall around midnight. Our signal. I tiptoed past our parents room in my socks, meet and by the laundry door. And we'd sneak out like little burglars in pajamas. He always carried a backpack with snacks, flashlights, and a notebook he pretended was mission logs. I think he just liked pretending we were spies. It became our tradition. Even when we weren't talking much during the day, we'd still sneak out. One time I fell asleep and missed the signal. The next morning, he left a granola bar and sticky note in my sock drawer that said, rookie mistake. You're on thin ice, Agent B. But as we got older, things changed. He got busier with school, started driving, started dating. I assumed we just outgrown it. No more nightly missions, no more late Taco Bell disappointments. I tap on the wall sometimes just to see. But he never knocked back. Then one night, about a year after our last mission, I couldn't sleep. Too much energy. I tapped on the wall, knowing it was pointless, but out of habit I crept to the laundry room anyway, and the back door was already open. I stepped outside. It was cold. Damn. The kind of quiet where even your own footsteps feel too loud. I walked to the side gate, and that's when I saw him sitting in the driveway, hoodie up, facing away from me. His backpack. Backpack was next to him. I almost called out, but something about the way he was sitting stopped me. Shoulders hunched, arms on his knees, like he was holding something back. I moved closer and heard it. Quiet, shaky breathe, then a sniff. He was crying. I crouched down beside the car, not sure if I should say anything, but then I heard him mumble something under his breath. I can't do it anymore. He wiped his face on his sleeve and pulled out his phone. I peeked around the car just enough to see the screen. It was a message thread with someone in it.

My son turned 8 last Saturday and his mom threw him this huge party at her parents house with bouncy castles and a magician. Probably 50 people there. I showed up with my gift wrapped in newspaper because I couldn't afford wrapping paper, and my ex wife's sister actually laughed out loud when she saw it. Her husband pulled me aside and said I should be embarrassed showing my face here when everyone knows I'm three months behind on child support. Asked if I even knew what grade he was in. I wanted to tell him that I actually knew his teacher personally because I've been volunteering at his school every lunch hour. But instead I just stood there and took it because arguing would just make everything worse for my boy. The whole party was basically two hours of my ex wife's family taking turns humiliating me while I tried to stay invisible near the fence. Her mom kept making these loud comments about how some fathers actually provide for their children. Her dad walked past me carrying my son's new bike and said maybe someday I could afford to buy my child something that didn't come from a thrift store. When they brought out the cake and my son wanted me to stand next to him for photos, his grandmother literally stepped in front of me and said they wanted pictures with people who were actually part of His life. I watched my boy's face fall and it took everything in me not to say something, but I knew they'd just use it against me in court. My ex wife's aunt asked me directly in front of everyone if I was still working that pathetic warehouse job or if I've been fired from that too. And when I said I was still there, she said at least my son would learn what not to become. My ex wife stood there telling her cousins that I lived in some disgusting studio apartment and probably spent my child support money on beer, while her sister nodded along and said some people just aren't meant to be fathers and that's okay. That's when a Grace Dan pulled up and this exhausted looking woman got out, carrying a thick folder and walking straight through the party toward me like everyone else was invisible. She looked distressed and said she was sorry, but this couldn't wait another day because the state was threatening to pull the placement if she didn't get the inspection done immediately. My ex wife's mom immediately stepped forward and demanded to know who this woman was and what the hell she was talking about. The woman said she was from Child Protective Services and she needed to inspect my home for the foster placement renewal and verify the twins were still thriving. My ex wife's sister went completely white and whispered what twins? The social worker flipped through her Papers and said she was talk
