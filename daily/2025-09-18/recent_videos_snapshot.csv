So my kids daycare had some family emergency and shut down for the day. They sent this email at like 3 in the morning, which was real helpful when I'm already asleep and have to work the next day. I'm scrambling around trying to find someone to watch my kid because I literally could not miss work that day. Had this huge presentation that would basically make or break my job. So I'm calling everyone I know at like 6:00am. The only person who picks up is my stepbrother's girlfriend, Ashley. She doesn't work, just sits around all day while my stepbrother pays for everything. I mean everything. Her daily Starbucks runs, weekly nail appointments, a whole designer purse collection. been trying to get her to do literally anything productive for years. But whatever, I'm desperate. I call her up, and she's like, oh, sure, I can totally watch him for you. I'm thinking, finally, someone's actually gonna help me out. Then she hits me with it. My family rate is $200 for six hours. I literally had to ask her to repeat that because I thought I heard wrong. $200 for six hours to watch one kid who mostly just plays with his tablet anyway? Are you being serious right now? I asked. She goes on this whole speech about how this is her livelihood and she takes childcare very seriously and that she's already giving me a family Discount. I'm thinking, what livelihood? You haven't worked a day since you moved in with my stepbrother three years ago. But I'm stuck. If I don't show up to work that day, I'm literally getting fired. So I agree to her insane price, and she demands the money up front before I even drop my kid off. I hand over $200 cash, drive to work fuming, and end up working barely four hours after you factor in traffic. So I basically paid 50 bucks an hour for her to sit on her couch and make sure my kid didn't burn the house down. Fast forward two years. Ashley and my stepbrother break up, but somehow she ends up living rent free in his dad's extra house and driving my dad's old car. My stepbrother still pays all her bills because they have a kid together. Now. She finally gets a job at some retail place because he stopped funding her weekly spa days. Then last month, I get this panicked text in our family group chat. Emergency. My babysitter bailed, and I have to work today or I'll get fired. Can anyone watch my daughter, please? I'm desperate. I'm reading this text, and I can't help but smile a little. I text her back super fast, I can totally help you out. I'll watch her. She's so relieved and grateful, sending me heart emojis and everything. Then I hit her with the kicker. My family rate is $200 for the Day, the typing bubbles appear and disappear, like, five times. Then my phone starts blowing up. Are you kidding me right now? That's way too much. I thought we were family. You're being ridiculous. Just screenshot our old conversation from two years ago and send it back to her. This is the exact same rate you charged me. You said it was the family rate, remember? You said you took this very seriously. She completely lost it. Started calling me every name in the book, saying I was petty and vindictive and that she was in a real emergency. I told her that's exactly what I said to her two years ago. The best part? She ended up having to call out of work anyway because nobody else would watch her kid for free on such short notice. And apparently, her manager was not happy about it.

This rich kid at my college paid me $500 to take his final exam. For him not cheat. Literally show up as him. See, Brad was this trust fund baby who partied through freshman year while I worked three jobs just to afford ramen. His dad threatened to cut him off if he failed chemistry. And Brad was looking at a solid F. Problem was, Brad and I looked almost identical. Same height, same messy brown hair. Even wore the same thick rimmed glasses. People mixed us up constantly. Which gave Brad a brilliant idea. He cornered me outside the library one Tuesday, panic in his eyes. You're a science major, right? Just walk in, take the test, walk out. 500 cash. I thought he was insane, but $500 was two months of rent money. My bank account had $47 in it, and my landlord was already leaving threatening notes. So I agreed to the stupidest plan ever. For two weeks, I lived and breathed chemistry. I memorized Brad's textbook, practiced his signature until my hand cramped. Even Learned to write with my left hand, since he was left handed. I studied his social media to copy his mannerisms. The kid barely knew what carbon was, but I was determined to nail this thing. I even got his roommate to help me practice. You need to slouch more, he said. Brad never sits up straight, and he always taps his pen when He's thinking the day of the exam, I showed up 20 minutes early, put up trying to look casual. My hands were shaking as I walked into the lecture hall. 200 students, and I was pretending to be someone else. The professor barely glanced at Brad student ID when I handed it over. Good luck, Bradley, he said without looking up. I found Brad's usual seat in the back corner and sat down. My heart was pounding so loud, I thought everyone could hear it. When they handed out the test, I felt confident. The first 30 questions were exactly what I'd studied. Molecular structures, chemical equations, periodic table stuff. I was flying through it. Then I hit question 47. Describe the quantum mechanical model of electron behavior in metallic bonding under extreme pressure conditions. I stared at the question for five full minutes. This wasn't just advanced chemistry. This was graduate level theoretical stuff. I'd never seen anything like it in Brad's textbook. That's when it hit me. Brad had been skipping so much class, he'd missed entire units. The professor had been covering cutting edge research while Brad was passed out in his dorm. I was complete. We screwed. Panic set in. I looked around the room. Everyone else was writing furiously. Some girl in the front row was already on the back page. I had two choices. Leave half the test blank and guarantee Brad fails, or make something up and hope for partial credit. So I Started inventing chemistry. I wrote about electrons forming pressure cascades and quantum tunnels under extreme conditions. I made up equations that sounded scientific but were complete nonsense. I described metals becoming molecularly fluid and electrons fade. He's shifting into higher dimensions. It was like writing science fiction, but with chemical formulas. When I handed in the test, the professor actually looked up from his papers. He flipped through my answers with raised eyebrows. Interesting approach, Bradley, he said slowly.

The school called me during a client meeting. Your daughter won't stop crying. We need you here now. My stomach dropped. Maya never cried at school. She was my tough girl who scraped her knee last month and asked for a Spider Man Band Aid while blood ran down her leg. I left my presentation half finished and drove like the world was ending. The secretary's face was pale when I walked in. She pointed down the hall without speaking. That scared me more than the phone call. Maya sat curled in the corner of the nurse's office, arms wrapped around her knees. Her favorite purple dress was torn at the shoulder. The butterfly hair clips I'd put in that morning were gone. When I touched her arm, she jerked away like I was made of electricity. Baby, what happened? I whispered. She wouldn't look at me. Just kept staring at the wall with empty eyes. The nurse shifted uncomfortably and told me Maya hadn't said a word since PE class ended. Missus Johnson brought her in like this. I took Maya home. She sat in the back seat, not her usual spot, next to me. That night, she wouldn't eat her favorite Mac and cheese, wouldn't watch cartoons. Just sat on her bed holding her stuffed elephant while helping her into pajamas. I saw them. Finger shaped bruises on her upper arms. Dark purple marks where someone had grabbed her hard. My hands shook. Maya, who did this? She finally looked at me. Her voice came out so small. Mister Garcia said if I tell, he'll hurt you. He said nobody believes little girls anyway. Mister Garcia, the PE teacher parents loved because he coached the winning soccer team. The one who high fived kids in the hallway, who'd been teaching for 15 years. I called 9 1 1 that night. The female officer who interviewed Maya was gentle, patient. Maya told her everything. How Mister Garcia took her to the equipment room during class. How he made her play a secret game. How it hurt. How he did it to other girls, too, during their special practice time. The principal called me at six am. Not to apologize, to scold me. He said I should have come to him first. That calling police was premature. That Mr. Garcia was a valued member of their community. I recorded the entire call.

The Disney princess stopped mid autograph, stared at my ankle, then at my six year old daughter, Emma, then back at my ankle. Sir, is that she started clearly breaking character, which apparently requires something serious at the Happiest place on earth. It's not what you think, I said quickly, but Cinderella was already flagging security. Within minutes, I was surrounded by three guards and mouse ear hats trying to look threatening, while tourists took photos of what they assumed was part of the show. Here's the thing. I'm not a criminal. The ankle monitor was court ordered, but not for the reason everyone assumes. My ex wife, Patricia, claimed I was a flight risk during our custody battle. Said I might take Emma to Brazil because I'd renewed my passport. I renewed it for a work conference in Toronto. Judge still ordered the monitor as a caution until custody was finalized. I've been wearing it for three months, setting off every metal detector in Orange County. Emma didn't understand why Cinderella looked scared. Daddy, why is the princess sad? I knelt down, ankle monitor clicking against the pavement. She's just confused about daddy's special bracelet. Security moved closer. One spoke into his radio, we have a code yellow in fantasy land. I didn't know what that meant, but it sounded bad. Tourists started pulling their kids away from us. One mom loudly whispered, that's why we check The registry, Karen. The head of security, a surprisingly intimidating man named Raul, escorted us to Disney jail. Yes, that's a real thing. It's a small office behind Main Street that smells like churros and broken dreams. Emma thought it was a VIP experience. Are we getting special Mickey ears? She asked. Raul pulled up my information on his computer. His expression shifted from suspicious to confused to sympathetic. City battle? He asked quietly. I nodded. He sighed. My brother went through the same thing. Judge made him wear one for six months because his ex said he'd flee to Cuba. He's never even been to Cuba. Raul made some calls 20 minutes late. Later, we had a Disney escort. Not because I was dangerous, but because Raul felt bad. No kids should have their Disney trip ruined by adult problems, he said. Our escort, Jerome, was a former NBA player who'd retired to work at Disney because he loved making kids happy. Emma rode on his shoulders the entire day. We skipped every line, got front row seats to every show. Jerome told everyone I was a special guest, which technically wasn't a lie. The ankle monitor kept setting off the sensors on rides. Space Mountain stopped three times because of me. They had to manually override the system. By the third ride, the operators knew me by name. Ankle monitor dad is back, they'd radio ahead. It became a running joke. One operator said, you know, we've had Weapons, drugs, even a snake once. But you're our first ankle monitor. I chose to take that as an achievement. Plot twist came at dinner. We were at the character meal when goofy sat down at our table. He pointed at my ankle, then did an elaborate MIME of being arrested, going to court, then being innocent. Emma laughed hysterically. Goofy's silly daddy. But then goofy pulled out his phone.

So I gave him exactly what he asked for. It started when I wore a tank top and shorts to the grocery store on a 90 degree day. You're not leaving the house dressed like a SLT, my dad said. While I was grabbing my car keys, I looked down at my completely normal summer outfit. Cover yourself up because I'm not having my daughter walking around looking like she's for sale, he continued. His face red with anger. I went back upstairs and changed into jeans and a hoodie despite the heat. And he nodded approvingly while saying this was about respect and dignity and protecting my reputation. That night I did some online shopping with his credit card since he cared so much about my clothing choices. Thank you for helping me understand modesty, I said. The next morning wearing a full length denim dress that covered everything except my hands and face. He seemed pleased until we got to his office barbecue where everyone kept asking if I was feeling okay and why I was dressed for winter. She's exploring modest fashion, he explained uncomfortably, while his co workers exchanged concerned looks and I stood there sweating through three layers of fabric. Monday, I wore a beekeeper's suit to school because dad had been very clear about covering up and protecting myself from unwanted attention. The principal called him within an hour asking if Everything was alright at home and whether I was being forced to wear extreme religious garments, it just a phase, my dad told them. But I made sure to explain loudly in the main office that my father said my body was shameful and needed to be completely hidden from men's eyes. The counsellor started taking notes while my dad's face turned purple. Tuesday brought his important client dinner at the country club and I arrived in a full birka. I'd ordered express shipping from Amazon. This is our daughter, my dad said weekly, as his Japanese investors stared in complete confusion. They kept asking questions about our family's religious beliefs and whether this was common in American households while I sat silently eating through my face covering. His biggest client pulled him aside to discuss their concerns about doing business with someone who had such extreme views about women. And I heard my dad desperately trying to explain it was just teenage rebellion. Wednesday, I upgraded to a hazmat suit for his company picnic because he'd mentioned Protection so many times that biological Protection seemed appropriate. His boss's wife cornered him by the potato salad to express her deep concern about what was happening in our home. If you need resources for controlling behavior or religious extremism, we have employee assistance programs, she said, while I stood nearby in my yellow containment suit explaining to anyone who asked that my dad said my skin was too dangerous to be Exposed to the public, Thursday was parent teacher conferences and I wore a Victorian morning dress, complete with a black veil that covered my entire face. My teacher asked my dad Point Blank if he was abusing me or forcing me into a cult while I sat there looking like a Gothic ghost from 1850. She seems to be crying for help, the teacher said sternly, while my dad tried to explain that I was doing this to myself. But she'd already seen my essay about how my father called me a slut for wearing normal clothes. Friday, I went full throttle when I wore a full medieval suit of armour to his promotion announcement dinner because nothing says covered up like actual metal plating. The clanking drew everyone's attention as I walked in and his regional manager immediately asked why his daughter was dressed like she was going into battle. My dad says my body is a weapon that needs to be contained. I announced to the entire restaurant and several people took out their phones to record while my dad tried to disappear into his chair. His promotion was put on hold pending an investigate into his home situation. Saturday morning, the neighbours had organised an intervention after seeing me mow the lawn in a radiation suit all week. We're concerned about your daughter's well being, Mrs. Jacob said, while six other concerned parents stood behind her. They documented everything with photos and time, time stamps, creating what they Called evidence of escalating abuse. My dad kept insisting I was doing this to spite him, but I maintained perfect innocence and said I was just following his rules about modesty and covering my shame full body. By Sunday, his girlfriend had dumped him via text, she couldn't date someone who psychologically tortured his daughter. His boss had suggested he take family leave to deal with his issues and Child Protective Services had opened a case file after receiving 17 different reports from concerned citizens. He sat at the kitchen table with his head in his hands while I stood there in my newest purchase, which was a full deep sea diving suit, complete with brass helmet. Please stop this, he begged. But I reminded him that he said I dressed like a slut and needed to cover up. Fine. Wear whatever you want, he said in defeat. But then his phone rang and his lawyer's name appeared on the screen. My mom had heard about everything from concerned friends and was filing for.

Maya was the kind of teacher who got off on making students miserable. In AP history, he'd lean over your desk during tests, breathing coffee breath down your neck while tapping his pen on your paper, just to throw you off. And when he handed back essays drowned in red ink, he'd always had his favourite line in the real world, this wouldn't fly. I spent all junior year counting down to summer, marking days off my calendar like a prisoner, thinking I'd finally be free of his polyester blazers and power trips. So when I walked into the driver's ed two weeks later and saw him sitting behind the instructor's desk, my stomach dropped like a stone. Where do I turn? I asked during our first lesson, gripping the wheel nervously. You don't turn unless I say to, he barked, making me swerve slightly. Just assume you're going straight until I say otherwise. Though with your steering, straight is a pretty loose term. The two other girls in the backseat exchanged looks through the rearview mirror. When Sophia gripped the wheel too tight, he chuckled. Death grip won't help you drive better, sweetheart. This isn't a strength test. Emily stalled at a stop sign and he slapped his knee, laughing. And this is why I keep my seatbelt extra tight with you girls. Never know when We're gonna stop or if we're gonna stop. By the third lesson, we discovered his pattern. He'd make his nasty jokes for 20 minutes, then use the afternoon drives as nap time while we practiced highway driving. Don't worry about that curb you just kissed, said when I beard slightly. I'm sure it'll recover from the trauma. Unlike my neck. When Sophia asked about parallel parking, he laughed. You can barely handle forward parking and you wanna try parallel? That's adorable. He spent the entire next lesson bragging about his important dinner plans with his wife. If we survive today's lesson, that is three teenage girls driving. I should update my will. One afternoon, Sophia slightly veered and he exploded. Jesus, are you trying to collect mailboxes? Cause you're doing great. He wiped tears from laughing so hard. You know, girls like you three are why insurance rates are so high. And why driving instructors need hazard pay. It's funny because it's true. Then he made his final comparison. My five year old nephew has better control of his big wheel than you girls have of this car. He was still chuckling when he added, just try not to kill us while I. And then he was snoring, head tilted back against the headrest. I looked at Emily and Sophia in the rearview mirror and something passed between us. That's when I realised he told me to never turn unless he said so. The interstate entrance was coming up on The right, and I could see the big green sign marking I ninety five north hanging over the highway like a dare. I tilted my head slightly toward it and Emily caught my glance, following my eyes to the sign before whispering, I didn't hear him say turn, while Sophia nodded slowly and added me neither. I glanced down at the fuel gauge showing a full tank. Back at the sleeping Mister Maya, and as we approached the on ramp and I felt the car naturally wanting to continue straight onto the interstate, I took a deep breath and tightened my grip on the wheel. Well, he did say to follow his instructions exactly. The merge onto the interstate was smooth, and Mister Maya kept snoring while the highway stretched endlessly ahead. 30 minutes passed, then an hour, and his phone started buzzing in the cup holder with increasing frequency. We passed the welcome to New Jersey sign after two hours, making Emily stifle a nervous giggle as his phone lit up.

Marry him anyway, my grandmother told me when I showed her the prenup my fiance's lawyer had drawn up. But first become exactly what they think you are. Everyone else said to run. My friends were horrified. My sister called me pathetic. The prenup basically said if we divorced, I'd get nothing. No alimony, no assets, no claim to anything acquired during marriage. Brian came from old money. His family was convinced I was a gold digger, a nurse marrying a tech CEO for his bank account. The prenup was their idea, protecting their precious son from the calculating poor girl. Sign it, grandma said, then go back to school. With what money? His. She was right. The prenup said nothing about education expenses during marriage, thing about him paying for my life while married. It only protected assets and divorce. So I signed it. His family celebrated. His mother actually said, so glad you understand your place. The day after our wedding, I enrolled in law school. Ryan thought it was cute. My little wife wants to be a lawyer. His friends laughed about how I'd never finish. I finished top of my class, law review, passed the bar, first try. His mother sneered at graduation. Such a waste. You'll be having babies soon. Anyway, I started my MBA next. Ryan paid for everything. We were married, shared finances. The prenup couldn't touch that. His family rolled their eyes at family Dinners while I discussed international business law. Seven years in, I had a law degree, an MBA and had started a consulting firm with the money Ryan gave me for shopping. Built it from nothing to six figures while being the perfect trophy wife at his events. His family still treated me like trash, still made jokes about the prenup protecting them from me. Ryan started believing them, getting cocky, cheating because what was I going to do, leave with nothing? Year 10, I filed for divorce. Ryan laughed. You get nothing. Remember that prenup you signed? Actually, I said I get everything I built. While the prenup protected his pre marriage assets and his income, it said nothing about businesses started during marriage with marital funds. My law degree taught me that. My MBA helped me build it. My consulting firm was worth $2 million. Started with his money? Yes, but legally mine. That's fraud, his mother screamed at mediation. That's marriage. My lawyer, my study partner from law school replied she used marital assets to build her own career. Completely legal. They tried to fight it at $300,000 on lawyers trying to break my business claim. But I documented everything perfectly, every dollar traced, every paper filed correctly. My grandmother's advice that everyone thought was stupid, become exactly what they think you are, then become something they never imagined. I thought I was a gold digger. Fine. I dug through their legal gold mine and found my own treasure. The best part was during the divorce proceedings, Ryan's lawyer tried to argue, I'd planned this all along.

My little sister demanded I teach my study partner how to braid hair because she was convinced we were secretly in love. Emily was eight and had this weird obsession with my chemistry study partner, Conrad. Every Tuesday and Thursday when he'd come over, she'd magically appear with some urgent eight year old business. Can I show you my rock collection? Do you wanna see me do a cartwheel? Did you know I lost a tooth yesterday? Conrad was incredibly patient with her, always stopping whatever we were doing to admire her latest drawing or listen to her explain why unicorns were scientifically possible. I kept apologizing, but he just laugh and say she reminded him of his little cousins back home. He actually seemed to enjoy her interruptions, which made me like him even more. One Thursday, Emily cornered me in the kitchen while Conrad was in the bathroom. You need to teach Conrad how to braid hair, she whispered urgently. Why would I do that, M? Because when you guys get married and have daughters, he'll need to know how to do their hair for school. It's basic dad requirements. I nearly choked on my water. We're not getting married. We're just study partners. She rolled her eyes. He looks at you funny when you're working on equations. Like how dad looks at mom when she's making pancakes. Trust me, I'm very observant about Romance things. The next week, she orchestrated her master plan. Right before Conrad arrived, she accidentally left her favorite doll, Bella, in the living room, hair completely tangled. When Conrad walked in, Emily gasped dramatically, oh, no!

What was your breaking point? Ever since my son Leo was a little kid, he was just awful to other children. At 5 years old, he was kicked out of kindergarten for backing other kids into corners just to watch them cry. When our daughter Mia was born, keeping Leo away from her was a full time job. We had to move her crib into our bedroom and lock the door just to keep her secure. Later, when Mia was old enough to start losing her baby teeth, we did the whole tooth fairy thing. She put a tooth under her pillow and wake up to a few dollars. But every single morning, after showing us the money, she'd tell us the tooth itself was missing. My husband and I never touched them. Around that same time, Leo claimed the old shed in our backyard as his clubhouse and told us to stay out. But I'm his mother. So one day, I went in to see what he was up to. I found all of Mia's missing teeth laid out in a neat little row on his workbench. A cold feeling wash over me. When we confronted him about it, he just lost it. He screamed horrible things at us before locking himself in his room for three straight days. Over the years, we tried therapy, and he was kicked out of several schools. It wasn't until high school that we saw just how risky he was. One afternoon, a girl from his class knocked on our door. She looked terrified. She told me Leo had been following her home from school every day. She said she was scared for her life and didn't know who else to turn to because no one would listen. My stomach sank. I heard the real fear in her voice, and I apologized over and over. I promised I would talk to him, but deep down I knew it wouldn't do any good. Nothing I said ever did. That afternoon, when I mentioned the girl, he exploded. He started flipping chairs and throwing things across the kitchen. I had to run and lock myself in our bedroom to get away from him. The last thing I heard was him screaming, you'll all pay for this! Before he slammed the back door and went to the shed. I stayed in my room until my husband got home. He saw the broken kitchen window and the mess from Leo's fit and got mad. I'll go talk to him, said. Maybe he'll listen to his father. Then he walked out to the shed. A minute later, I heard a scream that I will never forget. I ran outside and found my husband on his knees in the grass, just crying. He looked up at me and whispered, don't go in there, but I had to see. I ran right past him. When I opened the shed door, I saw him.

He looked at me all calm and said I'm just mentally preparing. I've never looked at showers the same way. Two. I found out men treat fridges like treasure hunts. He'll open it five times in a row, stare like something new is going to spawn, side dramatically, and then eat plain cheese straight from the block. I once asked why he keeps checking. He said in case a snack magically appears. Three I didn't know guys hum to themselves during the most random tasks. My boyfriend will be cleaning the sink, humming what sounds like boss battle music, then suddenly switch to singing about how this sponge is my sword. I caught it on video once and he begged me not to post it. 4. They'll wear the same hoodie for a month straight like it's a second skin. When I suggested washing it, he looked genuinely confused and said but it still smells like me, so it's fine. 5. They will absolutely keep random screws or wires in a just in case drawer. I asked why. He said because you never know when you'll need this. It was a bent nail. 6 point 10. They make sound effects for everything. Opening jars, throwing socks in the laundry, even getting up from the couch. Suddenly he's making rocket launch noises. 7. They'll stand in front of the mirror flexing, not realizing you can see them. The second they notice, they pretend they were checking their posture. 8. They'll eat an entire meal over the sink just to save dishes, and apparently that's normal to them. 9. They'll absolutely risk breaking a limb before making two trips from the car. Groceries stacked to their chin, wobbling like a Jenga tower, but proud. 10. They can sit in total silence for an hour staring at the wall, and when you ask what they're thinking about, they say nothing. And somehow they really mean nothing.

I pretended to be my cousin, the substitute teacher for a day and accidentally got my dream job. I was 19, broke as hell and still waiting to hear back from community college. My cousin Tyler was a substitute teacher who sometimes paid me to drive him around since his car was trash. One Tuesday morning he calls me freaking out, dude, I just rear ended someone. I'm supposed to be at Westbrook Middle School in 20 minutes. If I miss another day, they'll cut me from their sublist. I was eating cereal in my pajamas. That sucks, man. Wait, he said, you still have my school ID from when you helped me move those boxes last month? Yeah. Why? I'm serious. Let's go. Pretend to be me. Take attendance. Keep them quiet. It's just study hall. I laughed. You're insane. Please. They won't even check. Most subs just sit there anyway. It's one period. Something about the desperation in his voice got to me, plus I needed money. I threw on Tyler's spare button down shirt that was way too big and drove to the school with his laminated badge. The front desk lady barely looked up. You must be the sub for Miss Peterson's class, room 2, 13. Here's your clipboard. I walked down that hallway trying to look confident while my heart was pounding. The kids were loud but not crazy. I took attendance, reading names off the Roster, when they asked where their teacher was, I said she had a family emergency and today was independent study. Can we work on homework, this girl asked. Absolutely, I said. Having no clue what else to tell them. For an hour, I just walked around pretending to supervise while they did whatever. Some kid asked me about math and I said I'd get back to him. Another wanted to use the bathroom and I let like five kids go because I didn't know the rules. The bell rang and a whole new group of kids walked in. Nobody had told me there were multiple periods. I panicked but tried to play it cool. Same routine, independent study day. The projector wasn't working, so sorry, no video today. I made them read silently and told them I'd be grading papers instead. I just stared at Tyler's lesson plan book trying to figure out what I was supposed to be doing. Third period came, then fourth. I was making it up as I went. When kids got too loud, I'd say stuff like, remember, this affects your participation grade, even though I had no idea how grading worked. During lunch, I hid in an empty classroom and texted Tyler updates, kept saying, you're doing great, just get through the day. Fifth period, this kid asked me about the Revolutionary War assignment. I panicked and said, what do you think the most important battle was? Then I made them debate it while I googled stuff on my phone under the desk. By 6th period, I was actually getting comfortable. These kids weren't that different from my little brother and his friends. I started a trivia game about random stuff, and they were actually into it. Then the assistant principal walked in my.

I cut out all the late night snacking, stopped getting coffee With extra syrup and started walking to the grocery store instead of driving. I wasn't trying to do anything extreme. I just wanted to lose enough weight that Emma couldn't make her little comments anymore. The first month, I lost 12 pounds. Emma noticed right away when we met for brunch and kept asking what I was doing differently. I told her I was just eating better. And she got this weird look on her face like she didn't expect me to actually do anything about it. By month two, I was down 25 pounds and feeling amazing. I bought new jeans that actually fit.

When I was 15, my mom discovered my journal where I'd written about kissing a girl from my class. She didn't knock when she barged into my room that night. Just stood in the doorway, clutching my journal with white knuckles. This ends now, she said, her voice terrifyingly calm. No daughter of mine will be this. She couldn't even say the word lesbian. I tried explaining that I was still figuring things out, that it wasn't a big deal. But mom called dad in, showed him the pages. He looked more disappointed than angry, which somehow hurt worse. They scheduled an emergency appointment with Pastor Williams the next morning. Not a therapist, not someone trained in adolescent development. Their church pastor, who believed homosexuality was a choice. Listen. For three hours, I sat in his office while he explained how I was confused, how Satan was testing me. My parents nodded along to everything he said. Mom kept squeezing my hand when I tried to speak. The following week, they announced I was being sent to my aunt for the summer. For your spiritual health, mom said. What she didn't say was that my aunt ran a church camp specifically designed to fix kids like me. Camp restoration was nothing like the name suggested. No crafts or swimming or campfires. Just daily air sessions and one on one counseling that felt more like interrogations. We Were constantly monitored. No privacy in bathrooms, no unsupervised conversations with other campers. One. One night, a girl named Tara tried to run away. They caught her at the fence and made us all watch as they prayed over her for hours, calling out the demons of rebellion and perversion. Two weeks in, I developed a fever. Not just a slight temperature. I was burning up, delirious. The camp nurse gave me some painkillers and sent me back to group sessions. When I collapsed during prayer, they finally called my parents. Mom and dad drove eight hours to get me in the hospital.

What? Of course not. Why are you asking me this? Because when you went to the bathroom last night, you got a message from settings on the imessage app. Wait, why were you going through my phone? Do not turn this on me. Who is that and what are you guys messaging? It's just some tech support agent helping me with my phone. Relax, babe. It's nothing. Oh, really? Luckily, I knew you would lie to me, so I unlocked your phone and checked your messages with him. And why is your tech support agent sending you willy pics that you hearted? Jake's got a better life than you. Anyway, we're done. Wait. Not only did you cheat on me, it was with Jake, my childhood best friend. I've known him for the past 17 years. How could you do this to me? He's far better and pretty much everything than you anyways. Have fun being lonely. How could you do this to me? Bro? Over a girl? What happened to bros before hoes? So you found out. You want a cookie now? I'll remember that. I need your help to get back at Jake. What happened? He's your best friend. Can't explain right now, but are you in or out? Tight. What do you need me to do? Jake has a business meeting with his boss tomorrow. Take a bunch of leeches and plant them in his boss's suit. Jack always carries his laptop. In a suitcase. So put a jar of leeches in there. And when he takes his computer out to show his boss the work, his boss sees the jar of leeches and fires him. He gets fired next since Sarah probably left him since he lost his job. Now Jake spends a ton of time on discord to cope. Make a e girl account and catfish him. Get to know him and send him frequent selfies of some Instagram model. Now that you got his trust, ask him to send you money to fly you out. He's a SIMP so he'll fall for it. Once he sends it, block him. Donate this money to a racist charity under his name. Take a screenshot of this and upload it to TikTok so that companies see that he's racist. He can't get a job in business anymore. He's got to work in fast food now. And he's probably gonna be a cook since he loves to cook. But it's 100% gonna be McDonald's since that's his favorite fast food. So go to his joint and order a 10 piece Mcnugget through the driveway. Once you get the 10 piece, eat three of them and complain to the manager that you didn't get 10 and he'll get a warning. With this, do this a few more times across two days, but on Doordash with different names. He gets fired and has a bad reference since he can't even work properly in fast food. Now he can't even get a job, so he's homeless. Go up to him with a challenge. Tell him that if he can swallow a spoon of cinnamon in under one minute without water. Add on that if he does this, he gets $10,000. He's gonna take this offer up since he's homeless. Take your phone out and start recording to make it seem like it's a real YouTube video. Once he puts the cinnamon in his mouth, run for your dear life. Avenge me! You can now check part 2 by pressing share. Then more.

At 5 7 and 140 pounds, I wasn't exactly the most intimidating. Drunk guys at bars always picked me when they wanted to look tough in front of women. So when I saw this 6 2 gym bro marching over to where I was chatting with a pretty brunette, I already knew how this would go. He wedged himself between us, his massive frame completely blocking me out. Didn't even look at me, just turned his broad back like I was furniture. Let me get you a real drink, beautiful, he said. Flag down the bartender, not whatever this little guy was boring you with. She glanced around his shoulder at me, clearly uncomfortable. Actually, we were just. Trust me. He cut her off, placing a protective hand on the bar in front of her. Eating a wall. You need someone who can actually take care of you. He ordered her a martini without asking, then finally acknowledged my existence with a dismissive glance. You can go now, buddy. When I didn't move, he shifted his weight, using his size to push me further down the bar. The edge of the counter dug into my ribs. Still, I stayed put, sipping my beer. He'd expected me to scurry away by now. He turned to me fully for the first time, looking me up and down with theatrical disgust, asked If I I was deaf or something. When I calmly said I was just finishing my drink, his hand shot out and swiped my glasses off my face. They clattered across the bar. Everything went blurry. He made jokes about me not being able to see up to his height. Told the girl maybe that's why I hadn't gotten the hint. I stayed still, breathing normally. 10 years of training had taught me the most important lesson real fighters don't fight in bars. Much liability. Too much to lose. My instructor certification, my gym, potential lawsuits, all gone over some drunk idiot. I reached for my glasses with measured movements. He slid them further away with one finger, told me to leave them. I walked around him to retrieve them, keeping everything neutral. When I sat back down with my glasses, he spun around to face the entire bar and announced loudly that we had a creeper situation. His voice boomed over the music as he pointed at me with his beer bottle, claiming I've been bothering this nice lady for an hour. The brunette tried to protest, but he interrupted, putting a possessive hand on her shoulder that made her flinch. Told everyone not to worry, he had it handled. His buddies at a corner table started laughing and shouting. Someone asked if I was in middle school. He grinned and turned to the bartender, suggesting I should be carded again because I looked about twice. The brunette pulled Away from his hand, but he kept talking over her, telling her she didn't have to be polite anymore. Half the bar was watching now, some people whispering, shooting me, suspicious looks. My reputation at this place where I've been a regular for two years, was being destroyed in real time. Then he decided to demonstrate my weakness. He grabbed my wrist, suddenly, holding it up for the bar to see, while comparing it to his 12 year old nephew's arms. I didn't resist, keeping my breathing steady as he squeezed harder, his thumb pressing into the pressure point. He yanked me off the bar stool, effortlessly, spinning me around to show the girl what would happen if real danger showed up, then shoved me back against the bar. Not hard enough to be considered assault, but enough to make his point. The edge dug into my spine. He stood there waiting, telling me to push back, show her I was a real man. I stayed relaxed, hands at my sides, no aggressive stance, nothing that could justify what he wanted to do. His face darkened at my non reaction, called me pathetic. He turned to the girl, explaining this was why she needed someone like him around, painted scenarios of what could happen with me just standing there, doing nothing if he was actually dangerous. The brunette stood up, said she was leaving. He grabbed her wrist, immediately, insisting he'd walk her to her car because the streets weren't Safe. Her voice was firm, but I could hear the fear underneath. When she told him to let go, he tightened his grip slightly, still smiling, saying he was just trying to help. She tried to pull away, but he held firm, told her to relax. He was just being a gentleman. His grip tightened enough to make her gasp. She was getting genuinely scared now, panic in her voice as she pushed against his chest with her free hand. That's when something shifted in his eyes. The drunk bravado turned into something ugly.

My mother is the most baby obsessed psycho I've ever met. Starting when I was 8 years old, she made me and my sister Daniela wear these pregnancy simulation suits for hours every single day. 20 pounds of sand strapped to our stomachs while we practice breathing exercises and watch birthing videos. If we complained about back pain, she'd add more weight and tell us, real mothers don't whine. She even made us practice breastfeeding with these baby little dolls that would cry if you didn't hold them right. While I spent every session plotting my escape, Daniela embraced it as if it was her one true purpose. She'd waddle around the house with perfect posture, rubbing in her fake belly and talking to it out loud. By the time she turned 16, she was begging mom to let her be a practice surrogate for her infertile work friends. And when she turned 18, Mom threw her a massive party, not for graduating high school, but for signing her first surrogacy contract. Everyone was calling her a blessing and an angel, while I sat in the corner feeling like I was at a livestock auction. Within three years, Daniella had carried three babies for three different couples. Each time she came home from the hospital, mom would parade her around town like she'd won a Nobel Prize. Look at my generous daughter giving the gift of life. Meanwhile, I was getting a biomedical degree. Volunteering at women's shelters and learning about bodily autonomy. But none of that mattered. Such a waste of a perfectly good uterus. Mom would tell anyone who'd listen. Her sister has blessed three families, while this one hordes her fertility for herself. The most terrifying part was watching Daniela deteriorate after her fourth pregnancy. At 22, she could barely walk without pain, her hips were destroyed, she had constant infections, and her hair was falling out in chunks. When I tried to talk to her about it, she grabbed my hands with tears in her eyes. Maria, this is what I was made for. My body is a vessel for miracles. Why can't you understand that? That's when I knew she was gone. So I played along just enough to keep mom off my back. Told her I was considering pregnancy, wore looser clothes to family events, even googled fertility clinics in front of her, all while secretly taking the LSAT and applying to law schools across the country. Lol. I specialized in reproductive rights and medical ethics, spending years helping women escape forced pregnancy situations. By 28, I was finally making a difference. So when mom invited me to Daniela's Celebration dinner, I figured it was just another pregnancy announcement. Boy, was I wrong. Turns out it was an effing intervention. Sweetie, you're not getting any younger, mom announced while Daniela sat beside her belly swollen with pregnancy. No. 5. So I've taken the liberty of starting your fertility Treatments. Before I could respond, she pulled out a syringe filled with hormones. Just a little boost to get those eggs flowing. I jumped back, but Daniela grabbed my arms from behind. Please, Maria, just try it. I've already found the perfect couple for your first baby. I screamed and fought, but mom was already coming at me with the needle. That's when I noticed the other syringes on the table. They've been planning this. Mom punched the needle into my thigh. I felt the cold liquid burn through my muscle. Within minutes, my vision blurred, and my ovaries felt like they were on fire. Through the haze, I heard mom on the phone. Yes. Started the protocol. She'll be ready for harvest in two weeks. That's when I realized this wasn't just about family pressure anymore. This was trafficking. I woke up in the ICU with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome so severe, they nearly had to remove everything. My mom stood towering over me. We only brought you here because we wanted to save your womb, was the first thing she said. I pressed the red button for the nurse. We took one look at my mom and escorted her out to perform private examinations. As soon as we were alone, I felt even worse because she wrapped her arms around me and asked if I was okay. I broke down crying because the whole thing.

So I've been feeling like the backup friend for months. It started when I got really sick with the flu last winter. I'm talking fever, can't get out of bed sick. I texted our group chat asking if someone could bring me soup or medicine from the store. Radio silence for 3 hours. And finally Emma responds with, Oof, feel better. And that's it. But two days later, when Brad wanted people to come help him move his couch, four of them showed up immediately. I started paying attention after that. When I'd suggest hanging out, I'd get excuses. When anyone else suggested something, suddenly everyone was free. During conversations, they talk over me or just ignore what I said completely.

He was at some house party with people from our group, including Jess, whose car had mysteriously started working. That's when I decided to test them. I crafted this message about how my mom was in the hospital after a car accident and I was scared and needed someone to drive me there because I was too shaken up to drive. I sent it to our group chat at seven PM on a Thursday. First response came from Emma an hour later. Oh, no, hope she's okay. Keep us updated. No offer to help. Tyler hearted the message. That's it. Just hearted it like it was a funny meme or something. Just texted me privately saying she would help but her boyfriend had the car. Brad said he was at work until late. Two others never even responded. Six people I'd called my best friends for four years and when I needed them most, they all had excuses. But here's where it gets interesting. I have this coworker named Alex who I'd only hung out with a few times outside work. He barely knew me beyond small talk about weekend plans. I decided to text him the same message just to see what would happen. This guy dropped everything, called me immediately, said he was leaving his girlfriend's apartment right then to pick me up, showed up at my door 20 minutes later with snacks and a phone charger, asking which hospital and if I needed anything else. I felt so bad I almost came clean right there. Instead, I told him my mom was okay, that it was just a Scare and false alarm. He was genuinely relieved and said he was glad to help anytime. Meanwhile, my so called best friends were still posting TikToks and Snapchat stories like nothing happened. The next day in our group chat, everyone asked how my mom was doing. I said she was fine. Thanks for all the support. The sarcasm went right over their heads. Emma even had the nerve to say that's what friends are for with a heart emoji. I started pulling back after that, stopped initiating conversations, stop suggesting plans. Guess what happened? Nothing. They literally didn't notice I was gone. Three weeks passed before anyone texted me directly and it was only because Tyler needed someone to cover his shift at the pizza place where we both worked. Last weekend was the breaking point. I saw on Instagram they all went to this escape room place we talked about going to for months, the same place I'd suggested multiple times and got shut down. There they were, all six of them posting stories with captions like squad goals and best friends forever. So I made my decision. I started a new group chat called Real Friends Update with just Alex and two other people who'd actually shown they cared. I posted about moving on from fake friendships and finding people who actually value you.

At 5 7 and 140 pounds, I wasn't exactly the most intimidating drunk. Guys at bars always picked me when they wanted to look tough in front of women. So when I saw this 6 2 gym bro marching over to where I was chatting with a pretty brunette, I already knew how this would go. He wedged himself between us, his massive frame completely blocking me out. Didn't even look at me, just turned his broad back like I was furniture. Let me get you a real drink, beautiful, he said. Flag down the bartender, not whatever this little guy was boring you with. She glanced around his shoulder at me, clearly uncomfortable. Actually, we were just, trust me. He cut her off, placing a protective hand on the bar in front of her, creating a wall. You need someone who can actually take care of you. He ordered her a martini without asking, then finally acknowledged my existence with a dismissive glance. You can go now, buddy. When I didn't move, he shifted his weight, using his size to push me further down the bar. The edge of the counter dug into my ribs. Still, I stayed put, sipping my beer. He'd expected me to scurry away by now. He turned to me fully for the first time, looking me up and down with theatrical disgust, asked If I, I was deaf or something. When I calmly said I was just finishing my drink, his hand shot out and swiped my glasses off my face. They clattered across the bar. Everything went blurry. He made jokes about me not being able to see up to his height, told the girl maybe that's why I hadn't gotten the hint. I stayed still, breathing normally. 10 years of training had taught me the most important lesson, real fighters don't fight in bars. Too much liability, too much to lose my instructor certification, my gym, potential lawsuits, all gone over some drunk idiot. I reached for my glasses with measured movements, slid them further away with one finger, told me to leave them. I walked around him to retrieve them, keeping everything neutral. When I sat back down with my glasses, he spun around to face the entire bar and announced loudly that we had a creeper situation. His voice boomed over the music as he pointed at me with his beer bottle, claiming I've been bothering this nice lady for an hour. The brunette tried to protest, but he interrupted, putting a possessive hand on her shoulder that made her flinch, told everyone not to worry, he had it handled. His buddies at a corner table started laughing and shouting. Someone asked if I was in middle school, grinned and turned to the bartender, suggesting I should be carded again because I looked about 12. The brunette pulled away. From his hand, but he kept talking over her, telling her she didn't have to be polite anymore. Half the bar was watching now. Some people whispering, shooting me suspicious looks. My reputation at this place where I've been a regular for two years was being destroyed in real time. Then he decided to demonstrate my weakness. He grabbed my wrist, suddenly holding it up for the bar to see while comparing it to his 12 year old nephew's arms. I didn't resist, keeping my breathing steady as he squeezed harder, his thumb pressing into the pressure point. He yanked me off the bar stool, effortlessly spinning me around to show the girl what would happen if real danger showed up. Then shoved me back against the bar. Not hard enough to be considered assault, but enough to make his point. The edge dug into my spine. He stood there waiting, telling me to push back, show her I was a real man. I stayed relaxed, hands at my sides, no aggressive stance, nothing that could justify what he wanted to do. His face darkened at my non reaction, called me pathetic. He turned to the girl, explaining this was why she needed someone like him around, painted scenarios of what could happen with me just standing there doing nothing if he was actually dangerous. The brunette stood up, said she was leaving. He grabbed her wrist immediately insisting he'd walk her to her car because the streets weren't safe. Her voice was firm, but I could hear the fear underneath. When she told him to let go, he tightened his grip slightly, still smiling, saying he was just trying to help. She tried to pull away, but he held firm, told her to relax. He was just being a gentleman. His grip tightened enough to make her gasp. She was getting genuinely scared now. Panic in her voice as she pushed against his chest with her free hand. That's when something shifted in his eyes. The drunk bravado turned into something ugly.

Y'all were always talking, laughing at dumb stuff, venting, being weird together, making the most unhinged inside jokes that nobody else would get. And now they're just gone. Not even gone like we grew apart, but, like, replaced. Like they found a new group and suddenly forgot you existed. And they swear they still care. But the I'm going to sleep early is getting old. Especially when I see you online, in games, in calls with your new little friend group. Like, bro, I'm not stupid. I see the green dot. I see the whole friend list active. Don't lie to me and say it's nothing. You just stopped choosing me. And what hurts more is feeling like I'm just a backup now.

Last summer I got a text welcoming me to basketball dads 2023. Someone named Greg added me saying practice was Tuesdays at 6 and I needed to bring orange slices next week. I don't have kids, I'm not even that into sports, but I had just moved to a new city where I knew absolutely no one and something about being included felt nice so I just replied. Got it, thanks! Chat was surprisingly active. These dads were serious about their 8 year olds basketball league. They discussed zone defense strategies, complained about referee calls, and debated the merits of different sports drinks. I Learned that Coach Tim was too soft on the kids, that Brandon's dad never volunteered for anything, but always criticized that Kevin's son had real potential if he'd just focus more. When it came time for my orange slices, I panicked. Couldn't show up at a random children's basketball practice, so I texted that my car broke down but I'd Venmo someone for the snacks. Dave immediately replied no worries man, we got you. Car troubles are the worst. I sent $15 to Dave and felt strangely good about it. These guys were nice. Weeks passed, became invested in the team's progress. They lost to the Eagles by two points and I found myself genuinely disappointed. I celebrated when little Marcus finally made a basket after trying all season. Greg texted everyone about an end of Season Celebration at his house. All dads expect to attend. I considered coming clean, but by then I've been in the chat for two months. It would be weird to admit I wasn't actually part of their community, so I ghosted, ignored the invitation and subsequent messages asking if I was coming. The chat gradually slowed as the season ended. I figured that was it until three months later when my phone buzzed. Basketball Dads 2,023 has been renamed Soccer Dads fall 2,023 Greg alright, dad adds new season, new sport. Practice starts next Thursday. Dave my Tyler has never played soccer before. Any tips? Mike just buy good shin guards. Remember when Danny got bruised last year? They were back, and somehow so was I. This time I participated more, offering encouragement after games and soccer advice. I quickly researched on YouTube. The group needed a substitute. I nearly had a heart attack. Luckily, Brandon's dad finally volunteered for something. The team scheduled photo day and Greg sent a message. Need to confirm which kid belongs to 5 1 6 5 5 5 5 8 2 4 1 for the roster. That was my number. I froze. After eight months of being a phantom soccer dad, I had no choice but to confess. Guys, I need to tell you something. I don't actually have a kid on the team.

Suddenly, she demanded a divorce, saying, you're useless to me now. I replied, don't regret this later, lol. The funeral was Tuesday. By Friday, she was already shopping for a mansion in Beverly Hills. I don't need you anymore, she said, tossing divorce papers on our kitchen table next to my unemployment check. I'm finally free from dead weight. I just smiled and signed them without reading. She thought I was an idiot who'd given up. But here's what she didn't know. I've been having secret conversations with her father for months before or he died. He'd called me one evening, voice shaking with disappointment. Son, I need to tell you something about Kimberly. She's been pressuring me to change my will. She wants me to cut out her brother and sister completely. Says they don't deserve anything because they abandoned me. That wasn't true. Her siblings lived across the country but called him daily. Kimberly barely visited unless she needed money. There's more, he continued. I caught her going through my financial documents last week. She was photographing my bank statements and investment portfolios. When I confronted her, she said she was just helping me organize. That's when he told me his plan. The will Kimberly knew about it was fake. He'd shown it to her on purpose to test her character. The real will was locked in a different lawyer's safe. Two weeks after the funeral, we're at What she thinks is the final divorce meeting. She struts in wearing a five thousand dollar Chanel dress and diamond earrings. That cost more than my car. She's already bragging about her new Porsche in the mansion she put deposit on. This is so exciting, she tells the lawyer. I can finally live the life I deserve. No more supporting a jobless husband who brings nothing to the table. The inheritance lawyer walks in with a thick leather folder. I recognize him immediately. It's Martin Lee, her father's real attorney, not the junior associate who'd been handling the official proceedings. Missus, Benjamin, son. I'm afraid there's been a significant misunderstanding, he says calmly. Her smile falters slightly. What kind of misunderstanding? The will was clear. I inherited everything. He opens the folder and slides a document across the mahogany table. This is your father's actual will, executed just three months before his death. The document you've been referencing was, let's call it a preliminary draft. She grabs the papers, her manicured nails clicking against the desk. What are you talking about? This can't be right. Martin points to the highlighted section. Your father was quite specific. He left the entire estate to your husband, Benjamin here with explicit instructions that you receive nothing if you initiated divorce proceedings within two years of his death. The color drains from her face. That's impossible. He wouldn't do that to me, actually, Martin continues. He included a personal letter explaining his decision. Would You like me to read it? She nods weakly. Her earlier confidence.

What was your breaking point? Ever since my son Leo was a little kid, he was just awful to other children. At 5 years old, he was kicked out of kindergarten for backing other kids into corners just to watch them cry. When our daughter Mia was born, keeping Leo away from her was a full time job. We had to move her crib into our bedroom and lock the door just to keep her secure. Later, when Mia was old enough to start losing her baby teeth, we did the whole tooth fairy thing. She put a tooth under her pillow and wake up to a few dollars. But every single morning, after showing us the money, she'd tell us the tooth itself was missing. My husband and I never touched them. Around that same time, Leo claimed the old shed in our backyard as his clubhouse and told us to stay out. But I'm his mother. So one day, I went in to see what he was up to. I found all of Mia's missing teeth laid out in a neat little row on his workbench. Cold feeling wash over me. When we confronted him about it, he just lost it. He screamed horrible things at us before locking himself in his room for three straight days. Over the years, we tried therapy, and he was kicked out of several schools. It wasn't until high school that we saw just how risky he was. One afternoon, A girl from his class knocked on our door. She looked terrified. She told me Leo had been following her home from school every day. She said she was scared for her life and didn't know who else to turn to because no one would listen. My stomach sank. I heard the real fear in her voice, and I apologized over and over. I promised I would talk to him, but deep down I knew it wouldn't do any good. Nothing I said ever did. That afternoon, when I mentioned the girl, he exploded. He started flipping chairs and throwing things across the kitchen. I had to run and lock myself in our bedroom to get away from him. The last thing I heard was him screaming, you'll all pay for this! Before he slammed the back door and went to the shed. I stayed in my room until my husband got home. He saw the broken kitchen window and the mess from Leo's fit and got mad. I'll go talk to him, said. Maybe he'll listen to his father. Then he walked out to the shed. A minute later, I heard a scream that I will never forget. I ran outside and found my husband on his knees in the grass, just crying. He looked up at me and whispered, don't go in there, but I had to see. I ran right past him. When I opened the shed door, I saw him.

My brother Jake has this girlfriend named Becca who literally cannot stand not being the center of attention for five minutes. Every family dinner, every holiday, every gathering, she finds a way to make it about her. Last Thanksgiving, she announced she was pregnant right when my dad was about to carve the Turkey. Turns out she wasn't even pregnant. Just wanted to see everyone's reactions. So when I was planning my wedding to my fiance Ryan, I knew I had to do something about the Becca situation. This was going to be my one day. The one day that was supposed to be about me and Ryan starting our life together. I called Jake about three months before the wedding. Hey, so about the wedding I started. I need to ask you something kind of awkward. What's up? He said, and I could hear him eating cereal in the background. I really don't want Becca there. I know that sounds harsh, but she always makes everything about herself, and I just can't deal with that stress. On my wedding day, the line went quiet for, like, 10 seconds, and Jake exploded. Are you serious right now? You're uninviting my girlfriend from your wedding? I'm not uninviting her because she was never invited in the first place. The invitation was just for you. That's the same thing. We've been together for two years. She's basically family. I tried To explain that it wasn't personal, that I just wanted one drama free day. But Jake wasn't having it. He said if Becca couldn't come, then he wouldn't come either. I told him that was his choice. Think he changed his mind? He didn't. But here's where it gets crazy. The day of my wedding, I'm getting my makeup done in the bridal suite when my cousin Madison bursts in. Uh, you need to see this, he says, shoving her phone in my face. It's Becca's Instagram story. She's posted, like, 15 videos of herself getting all dressed up, doing her makeup, picking out jewelry. The caption on the last one says, can't wait to celebrate love today. With a bunch of heart emojis and the location tagged as our wedding venue. My heart drops. He's coming anyway. Madison nods. Jake's outside right now, arguing with your dad about it. He says he changed his mind and decided to bring her. I'm standing there in my wedding dress, half my makeup done, and I have to deal with.

Apparently, his parents were struggling with hospital bills, so the school was having a fundraiser to help his parents pay for it, made signs and had to collect donations from other parents that week. And at the end, she had collected almost $5,000. She was only nine, so I was really proud of her. That morning. I didn't have time to drive her to school, so I trusted her to bring the money to her teacher. I told everyone how caring she was. But when I turned my phone on at the end of the day, I saw numerous missed calls from her school. When I called back, they were asking why I wasn't there to drop off the money they raised. I told her my daughter brought it, but they had no idea what I was talking about. They started accusing her of stealing it. And I honestly couldn't believe they'd do that. I yelled at her over the phone, but she Still told me to check. I checked her room and found the money under her bed. I literally couldn't believe she'd do that and instantly went to ask her about it. When I did, she told me she just felt like keeping it. I wasn't even mad. I just knew I failed as a father.

On my first day, I had to learn all the happy dances you do when a kid comes in, and after an hour of that, I was completely on my own. My manager left me there by myself, so I was really nervous. But I noticed a couple come in, and the woman was very pregnant. They didn't have a kid with them, but I still helped them pick out a bear along with a fancy heart that had a heartbeat. They still didn't look happy at all, so I tried to cheer her up and made the woman do the happy dance before I stuffed the bear for them. I could see they were both still really upset and not knowing what to do, I made the mistake of asking her if she was okay. She just looks up at me and told me they were there to make a bear for her baby to be buried with, because they had just found out their baby's heart wasn't beating anymore. I immediately stopped trying to make her dance and could barely keep it together as I made the bear for her. It took everything I had to keep a smile as I helped them pay But as soon as they left, I ran to the back and completely bawled my eyes out. My manager came back to the store a minute later, saw the huge line, and then found me crying in the back. I tried to explain what happened, but he just told me to get out because I was fired.

So when she had to stop at another store, I told her I wanted to just stay in the car. She left the windows rolled down. And as I was sitting there, I suddenly got a genius idea. I decided to get her back for saying oh. So I climbed out the window and hid in a bush close to the car. I sat there waiting for her to come back, thinking her reaction would be hilarious when she saw I wasn't there. She came back out, and when she looked inside the car, she dropped everything she was holding. A few things broke, and she started searching the whole car while calling my name. She kept calling out for me, and I could hear how panicked she was. I was trying not to let her hear me laughing. She ran back into the store, and a few minutes later, the police showed up. Now multiple officers were calling out my name, asking people if they had seen me. Apparently, one guy said he saw me get into another car, but I have no idea what he was talking about. After a few more minutes, I was getting ready to jump out and surprise my Mom. And when I did, I saw her on the ground. There was an ambulance with her now, and they were giving her CPR. The police grabbed and questioned me, and my mom had to go to the hospital. Now, I knew I had messed up bad. Her heart completely stopped twice in the ambulance, but she survived. And she still doesn't know it was a prank.

When I was 23, I was severely depressed and no longer wanted to live. But every morning I would go to the same donut shop and the couple working there could tell something was wrong. They said hi to me every morning and asked how I was and even gave me food to take with, with me. They'd always do anything they could to make me smile. And every time they told me they'd see me tomorrow. It wasn't much, but I'm convinced this was the reason I was able to keep going. Eventually, however, his wife suddenly disappeared. I didn't want to be rude and question it, but I couldn't help but notice he was tired and wasn't smiling as much. Eventually, I heard from someone that his wife had suffered a brain aneurysm and she was in the hospital. Everybody loved them. So this news quickly spread and some tried to raise money to help them out. The man declined, however, and just kept working long hours to keep his shop going. Since he wasn't going to accept any donations, the community all decided they were going to do the only thing we could. So every morning before the sun even came up, hundreds of people lined up outside their shop and all bought out all of their doughnuts as quick as they could so he could finish early and go spend time at the hospital with his wife. They did this for weeks until she finally came back and had made a full recovery.

A few students decided to play a senior prank on the principal by writing on his car. And it made him so mad he decided to cancel the entire prom for the year. Everyone was pissed. So at the homecoming game the week after, we were chanting to bring it back. Eventually at the end, some kid with a banana suit jumped over the bleachers and ran across the field. Everyone screamed as he was being chased by coaches and teachers, and even the players loved it. Eventually, they tackled him hard and he ended up breaking his arm and had to go to the hospital. They had to cancel the game and the staff were so mad they suspended him for the rest of the year. He was probably gonna get expelled, but the students loved him so much, they decided they were gonna do something about it. That day, free Banana Man was born and everyone started chanting it in the halls. Few guys sold t shirts that said it and they wrote it all over the walls. At our school, there were bananas everywhere. And this made our principal so mad, he banned the phrase entirely. However, he didn't just stop there. He decided to go as far as to ban the actual fruit itself and even the entire color yellow. You literally weren't allowed to wear yellow to school. And if you were caught eating A banana, you were sent home for the day. This rule made the entire student body so furious they pretty much declared a war on the administration. Hundreds of students were getting sent home because they decided to bring bananas and wear yellow. And when they tell them to take their yellow shirts off, they'd walk around shirtless to class. I even saw a guy come to school in all yellow, and when they made him take it off, he tried to go to class only in his underwear, which was also yellow. It got so crazy that one kid who literally needed to eat bananas for the potassium couldn't for the week and ended up passing out in the middle of class. He went to the hospital and his parents threatened to sue the school. The very next day, we watched our principal walk out for the last time and the banana guy returned wearing his costume.

What did you do in 9th grade? I got the teacher everybody wanted for biology. Except one morning our entire class could hear her outside the room getting chewed out by our assistant principal for being late on grading. We also knew she had lost her sister the week before, so she was having a really rough time. A few minutes into teaching, she started explaining something about our final exam and the guys next to me were passing notes. They usually did it every time she turned around, but this time she saw them. She usually wouldn't have cared, but she thought it was something about her. So she walked over and asked to see it. Kid shook his head without saying anything. So she basically reached into his pocket to grab the note. She started reading it in front of the class and said, I left it in the garbage bin in room W12. It's all there with the. And stopped herself before reading the rest out loud. She looked down at the boy, clearly having read something bad and didn't know what to say. Her face was pale and not knowing what to do. She grabbed them both and literally yanked them out of the room. We all sat there confused for a half hour wondering what that note said. There were police at our school and they asked our whole route to come to the office. They questioned everybody about It, but nobody knew anything. And by the time they let us go, they had sent everybody home. We later found out that the note said there was a key to the office in that garbage bin along with a loaded gun. Both of them denied writing it and said they didn't know who it was for. So they decided to fire our teacher for creating a school wide panic and expelled our entire row.

When my daughter was 5, she begged me to put up Christmas lights for an entire day. She was literally crying because I was leaving for a work trip the next day and she told me Santa wouldn't come if our house wasn't decorated. It was really icy and snowing that day, but my wife told me to just do it. So I told her fine. I got the ladder and climbed up and my daughter passed me the lights and the colors she wanted. Right before we were almost finished, the slipped out from underneath me. I fell and hit my head on the concrete hard and remember the sound of her screaming. I didn't wake up until I was in the hospital later that day and felt the worst pain in my neck and back. I tried to feel for the bandages on my head, but strangely I didn't feel anything. I was really confused but barely managed to sit up and noticed I couldn't move my legs. I looked up and saw a nurse walk in the room and she looked really surprised. Five more people came in and all started asking me questions. I was really worried because I still couldn't move my feet no matter how hard I tried. I didn't know what was going on until an hour later when my wife finally got there. I was so happy. To see and didn't think anything about her. In tears, I asked who the girl she was with was because she was also crying. And when she walked closer, I made the most shocking realization of my life. This 13 year old was my daughter. And they broke the news. I was in a coma for almost nine years. I realized I had missed her entire childhood. I was paralyzed. My wife had remarried. But what hurt the most was when I went home to our house and I looked up at our roof. I broke down because those lights were still up.

She had cameras in every room of the house and asked me to call her every half hour just to make sure her daughter was okay. She told me I wasn't allowed to do anything except watch her. And when she finally left, I basically just sat there for three hours doing nothing until she came home. She came back and basically ran into the room to make sure the girl was okay and I assured her everything was fine. I had long hair at the time and had put it up at this point. And should probably now mention I have severe hearing loss. I have to wear hearing aids, which can usually be easily mistaken for headphones. Then as I was standing up to say bye to the girl, her mom noticed them in my ears. She thought I was wearing headphones the whole time and wasn't paying attention to the little girl. This made her furious and a second later, I felt her grab my head. All I remember was feeling the worst pain I've ever felt in my ear. I turned around to see her holding my hearing aid and realized what she did. She thought I was listening to music. She ripped my hearing aid. Out of my ear, thinking it was a headphone. And since they connect directly to my eardrum, she completely ripped that out, too. The pain was so intense I passed out and woke up in the hospital to my mom crying. She was livid. And even though they begged us not to, we sued her. I will never hear out of my ear again, but I'll never have to work again either.

Their church pastor, who believed homosexuality was a choice. Listen. For three hours, I sat in his office while he explained how I was confused, how Satan was testing me. My parents nodded along to everything he said. Mom kept squeezing my hand when I tried to speak. The following week, they announced I was being sent to my aunt for the summer. For your spiritual health, mom said. What she didn't say was that my aunt ran a church camp specifically designed to fix kids like me. Camp restoration was nothing like the name suggested. No crafts or swimming or campfires. Just daily air sessions and one on one counseling that felt more like interrogations. We Were constantly monitored. No privacy in bathrooms, no unsupervised conversations with other campers. One. One night, a girl named Tara tried to run away. They caught her at the fence and made us all watch as they prayed over her for hours, calling out the demons of rebellion and perversion. Two weeks in, I developed a fever. Not just a slight temperature. I was burning up, delirious. The camp nurse gave me some painkillers and sent me back to group sessions. When I collapsed during prayer, they finally called my parents.

All my friends were there and they wanted to meet Laura and I thought it was gonna be a fun night, but it was not. Okay, what, okay, what happened? You're leaving us on pins and needles here.

Um, one of my good girlfriends, not, uh, an ex, but just, uh, you know, a platonic girlfriend, you know, she, well, first of all, Laura was really in her phone throughout this entire house party. You know, when you can tell someone's really into their phone, like they're really on their phone. Yeah, that was her like the whole night when you're meeting people. Yeah, exactly. Is that the reason though, is like she Could have been nervous, right? No, it's because of what she was doing on her phone. Because one of my friends was kind of, you know, sometimes we do it, glancing over her shoulder and looking at what she was doing. And she was.

When I was 15, my mom discovered my journal where I'd written about kissing a girl from my class. She didn't knock when she barged into my room that night, just stood in the doorway clutching my journal with white knuckles. This ends now, she said, her voice terrifyingly calm. No daughter of mine will be this. She couldn't even say the word lesbian. I tried explaining that I was still figuring things out, that it wasn't a big deal. But mom called dad in, showed him the pages. He looked more disappointed than angry, which somehow hurt worse. They scheduled an emergency appointment with Pastor Williams the next morning. Not a therapist, not someone trained in adolescent development, their church pastor who believed homosexuality was a choice. For three hours, I sat in his office while he explained how I was confused, how Satan was testing me. My parents nodded along to everything he said. Mom kept squeezing my hand when I tried to speak. The following week, they announced I was being sent to my aunt for the summer. For your spiritual health, mom said. What she didn't say was that my aunt ran a church camp specifically designed to fix kids like me. Camp Restoration was nothing like the name suggested. No crafts or swimming or campfires, just daily air sessions and one on one counseling that felt more like interrogations. We were Constantly monitored, no privacy in bathrooms, no unsupervised conversations with other campers. One, one night, a girl named Tara tried to run away. They caught her at the fence and made us all watch as they prayed over her for hours, calling out the demons of rebellion and perversion. Two weeks in, I developed a fever. Not just a slight temperature. I was burning up, delirious. The camp nurse gave me some painkillers and sent me back to group sessions. When I collapsed during prayer, they finally called my parents. Mom and dad drove eight hours to get me in the hospital.

Just to annoy them. My parents were incredibly strict about screen time when I was growing up. One hour a day, no exceptions, no negotiating. My mom would literally set a kitchen timer when I logged on. When that thing rang, I had 30 seconds to shut everything down or I'd lose screen privileges for a week. Didn't matter if I was saving a game, watching a movie or in the middle of a school assignment. Time was time. So at 14, I found a loophole. The rule said very specifically, one hour of screen time. That was the phrase. No qualifiers, no details, just screen time. So I decided to maliciously comply in the most annoying, obnoxious way I could think of. I started using my one hour in the most unproductive, mind numbing and absolutely ridiculous ways possible. I'd boot up the computer, then spend 20 full minutes just staring at the loading screen of a game I never actually played. Or I'd open Microsoft Word and type complete gibberish random strings of letters like d, F, F, J, class, Jeff, ol Kashi while making over the top sounds of excitement. Wow, this is so fun, I'd say dramatically. Best screen time ever. Sometimes I'd open up paint, draw one pixel and then sit back and admire it like it was the Mona Lisa. My mom got confused at first. She peeked in during one of these Sessions and asked if something was wrong with the game. Nope, I replied cheerfully, just enjoying my screen time. It only got weirder from there. I watched the Windows defragmentation tool. I mean, watched it like it was a nature documentary. Oh look, block 42 just moved. I'd narrate in fake excitement. The breaking point came one afternoon when my dad walked into the kitchen and found me sitting cross legged in front of the microwave. I wasn't cooking anything meaningful, just heating up a mug of water, timer set for 15 minutes. And I was staring at the digital display completely zoned in like I was watching the series finale of my favorite show. My dad blinked. What are you doing using my screen time? I said innocently, this is a screen, right? I didn't even blink, just kept watching the numbers tick down. 1342, 1341. That was the beginning of the end. I kept pushing it, sat in front of the washing machine while it.

So I've been feeling like the backup friend for months. It started when I got really sick with the flu last winter. I'm talking fever, can't get out of bed sick. I texted our group chat asking if someone could bring me soup or medicine from the store. Radio silence for 3 hours. Then finally, Emma responds with, Oof, feel better. And that's it. But two days later, when Brad wanted people to come help him move his couch, four of them showed up immediately. I started paying attention after that. When I'd suggest hanging out, I'd get excuses. When anyone else suggested something, suddenly everyone was free. During conversations, they talk over me or just ignore what I said completely. At restaurants, they'd split the Bill evenly, even though I always ordered the cheapest thing because I was broke from college. The final straw was my birthday last month. I planned this whole thing at Dave and Buster's and invites two weeks early. The day of, I'm sitting there alone at a table for seven. One by one, the cancellations rolled in. Emma had a family thing. Tyler forgot he had to work, just said her car wouldn't start. But here's the kicker. I saw Tyler's Instagram story later that night. He was at some house party with people from our group, including Jess, whose car had mysteriously started working. That's when I decided to test them. I crafted this message about how my mom was in the hospital after a car accident and I was scared and needed someone to drive me there because I was too shaken up to drive. I sent it to our group chat at seven PM on a Thursday. First response came from Emma an hour later. Oh, no, hope she's okay. Keep us updated. No offer to help. Tyler hearted the message. That's it. Just hearted it like it was a funny meme or something. Just texted me privately saying she would help but her boyfriend had the car. Brad said he was at work until late. Two others never even responded. Six people I'd called my best friends for four years and when I needed them most, they all had excuses. But here's where it gets interesting. I have this coworker named Alex who I'd only hung out with a few times outside work. He barely knew me beyond small talk about weekend plans. I decided to text him the same message just to see what would happen. This guy dropped everything, called me immediately, said he was leaving his girlfriend's apartment right then to pick me up, showed up at my door 20 minutes later with snacks and a phone charger, asking which hospital and if I needed anything else. I felt so bad I almost came clean right there. Instead, I told him my mom was okay, that it was just a Scare and false alarm. He was genuinely relieved and said he was glad to help anytime. Meanwhile, my so called best friends were still posting TikToks and Snapchat stories like nothing happened. The next day in our group chat, everyone asked how my mom was doing. I said she was fine. Thanks for all the support. The sarcasm went right over their heads. Emma even had the nerve to say that's what friends are for with a heart emoji. I started pulling back after that, stopped initiating conversations, stop suggesting plans. Guess what happened? Nothing. They literally didn't notice I was gone. Three weeks passed before anyone texted me directly and it was only because Tyler needed someone to cover his shift at the pizza place where we both worked. Last weekend was the breaking point. I saw on Instagram they all went to this escape room place we talked about going to for months, the same place I'd suggested multiple times and got shut down. There they were, all six of them posting stories with captions like squad goals and best friends forever. So I made my decision. I started a new group chat called Real Friends Update with just Alex and two other people who'd actually shown they cared. I posted about moving on from fake friendships and finding people who actually value you.

I looked at her confused. What trip? I didn't receive anything. My grandmother's face darkened as she turned to my parents. The fifteen thousand dollar graduation trip to Europe I sent for Diego three months ago. The silence was deafening. My mom started fidgeting with her new designer purse, the one that mysteriously appeared last month along with matching shoes. My dad's gold chain suddenly felt heavier around his neck. And I noticed his expensive watch for the first time. We. We thought it would be better if my mom stamp her newly done nails, tapping nervously on the table. If what? Grandma's voice cut like ice. If you stole from your own son. That's when it all clicked. The sudden shopping sprees every weekend. My sister's new iPhone, iPad and MacBook. Family vacation to Cancun that I wasn't invited to. A kitchen renovation. Dad's new motorcycle sitting in our driveway. They'd stolen my graduation gift and spent it on themselves like it was Christmas morning. My sister Estania, who never worked a day in her life, was wearing earrings that cost more than my monthly gas station salary. Diamond studs that sparkled under the restaurant lights. She and even look up from her plate, too busy admiring her fresh manicure. You gave them everything their entire lives, I said quietly, my voice shaking with years of suppressed anger. And they took the One thing meant for me. The one thing I actually earned. Grandma stood up, her chair scraping against the floor loud enough to make nearby diners turn. 20 years I've watched you favor Estania over Diego like he's invisible. I sent that money specifically for him. With a letter explaining every detail of the trip I planned. My mom's face went white as paper. We never got a letter, I swear. Because you threw it away after cashing the check that had his name on it. The restaurant felt silent, despite other diners around us. Even the waiters seemed to sense the drama unfolding at our table. I couldn't hold back anymore. This explains everything. Why you suddenly had money for mom's Botox appointment and weekly spa days. Why dad bought that Harley Davidson he's been wanting for years. Why Estonia got her nose job and started posting Instagram photos from five star hotels every single week. My grandmother's eyes widened with each revelation. Nose job? Instagram photos? Show me. I pulled out my phone and showed her Estonia's recent posts. Bullside shots at luxury resorts in Miami. Designer shopping halls from Rodeo Drive. First class plane seats with champagne glasses. Expensive restaurant meals that cost more than I made in a week. All time stamped from the past three months. Right after my graduation, I've been working 70 hour weeks at the gas station just to afford my rent and groceries. I continued my voice, getting stronger, eating ramen Noodles for dinner. While watching them feast like royalty, I thought maybe you'd forgotten about my graduation. Or maybe you were disappointed in me. But this whole time, they were living off money meant for me. Grandma scrolled through the photos, her face getting redder with each. This hotel cost $800 a night. I know because I stayed there last year. And this restaurant, their appetizers start at $50. My dad tried to interrupt, loosening his collar nervously. Mom, if you'd just let us explain in the situation. Explain what, Nelson? How you forged my grandson's signature on bank documents? How you intercepted mail addressed specifically to him? How you've been lying to my face for months while spending his money? She reached into her purse and pulled out a thick envelope with legal documents. I brought copies of everything. The bank transfer with Diego's name, the hotel reservations in his name, the flight confirmations, the detailed itinerary. I spent weeks planning for his graduate

This morning, my phone exploded with 32 missed calls. It happened at Connor's birthday party. Lauren stood up during dinner and announced to our entire friend group, I've been seeing someone else. I need a real man, not a kindergarten teacher who makes 30 K a year. Everyone went silent. Then Connor actually started clapping. Finally. We've all been saying, you deserve better. The whole table nodded like they'd rehearsed this. I just smiled, put down my fork, and walked out. No drama, no begging. What? They didn't know. I've been teaching kids during the day, but spending nights getting my pilot's license. My broke teacher savings account actually had 180 K from cryptocurrency investments I'd made 3 years ago. But here's the real kicker. My uncle had been battling cancer for months. He owned a small aviation company that did scenic tours and flight training. Two days before Connor's party, he'd asked me to take over the business when he retired. The company was worth 1.2 million, debt free. I've been keeping it quiet while I finished my commercial pilot certification. Lauren knew about my uncle's business, but thought it was just some tiny operation with a couple old planes. She had no idea about the government contracts, the corporate partnerships, or the fact that we were expanding into helicopter tours next year. The night she humiliated me, I called my Uncle and said yes to everything. We started the paperwork immediately. I'd also been secretly applying to international schools. Teaching abroad had always been my dream, but Lauren constantly shut it down, saying it was unrealistic and running away from responsibility. The next week, I put in my transfer request to teach at an international school in Dubai. Posted one photo on Instagram. Me in the cockpit of a small plane with the caption new adventures. Lauren's new real man. Turns out he was married with two kids. His wife found their texts and posted everything on Facebook, tagging Lauren's workplace. She got fired from her marketing job for the drama. The guy's wife also sent screenshots to Lauren's parents, were mortified their daughter was involved with a married man. Meanwhile, my Dubai teaching position came with an 80 five k salary, free housing, and I started a weekend flight instruction business. But the real money came from taking over my uncle's company. Within two months, I'd expanded to corporate charters and landed a contract with a luxury resort chain worth 400 k annually. Connor started following my Instagram again after seeing photos of me flying over Dubai skyline. Even posted a comment, dude had no idea you were doing all this. Tanya from our friend group sent a DM. We all feel terrible about that night. Too late for fake friendship. And even faker.

When the doctor told me surgery or death, and my boyfriend drew told me to start digging my own grave. However, he'd soon come to regret it. I was sitting in the office after finally going in for the stomach pain I've been ignoring for months. This could have been prevented if caught earlier, he said, looking at my chart. When was your last checkup? Four years ago. I couldn't afford it. I have insurance, but I needed every penny for rent, bills, my boyfriend's art studio. The doctor frowned, tapping on a clipboard. I see. Well, the surgery will cost about $5,000 with your coverage. 5,000? I felt the air get knocked out from my lungs. Maybe next time, doctor. I can still handle it. He gave a worried look before signing the release papers. But three steps from the hospital door, I felt a sharp pain zapped through me. I dropped to my knees on the asphalt and coughed up blood. The security guard radioed for help, and they rushed me back on a stretcher. You're bleeding internally. If we don't operate soon, this could rupture. I frowned and gave them Drew's contact. Think he'd understand? Just this once? The nurse stayed with me while they prepped more paperwork. So you handle all the bills? She asked with a disgusted expression, after I'd explained our situation. Well, when drew makes it big, it'll All come back like an investment. The nurse couldn't help but roll her eyes at my answer. And how long has he been not making it big? Six years. And how many of these artworks has he sold? Nothing yet, but he's close to a breakthrough. His mentor says he has talent, but I think this time I might have overdone it. I work 60 hours a week, two jobs. I haven't bought new clothes in three years. I'd love to go to a salon one last time before, you know, I pass away, I said bleakly, laughing at my own terrible situation. You need to take care of yourself too, honey. She touched my hand gently. What does your partner contribute exactly? I opened my mouth and closed it. He contributes. He's following his passion. I'd like to show him my passion. My passionate fists, she mumbled to herself and smiled. All right, you rest up. She left the room, still clearly upset at my story, but it felt nice having someone worry about me for once. Drew arrived two hours later, looking annoyed. This is really bad timing. I have a studio session with my mentor. The doctor explained the situation again. The urgency, the cost. Drew's face lit up. Actually, this is perfect timing. What? I asked, shocked at his happy tone. We have exactly 5,000 saved, right? Well, my mentor knows a gallery owner, and I can finally book my first show. I stared at him. From the hospital bed. But that money is for my surgery. Yeah, but we could get a loan for that, right? This is my one shot, drew. I'm dying. He looked at me with a raised eyebrow and an expression that screamed, so what? I snapped. No, I said calmly. What do you mean, no? The heart monitor slowly started rising. Six years, drew. I've paid for your life for six years. And now when I plan on choosing myself for once, you tell me not to. But it's not just a gallery. It's my dream. I tried to fight back my tears, but couldn't hold them. Your dream over my life. All this time, I've just been some sponsor to your dream. An open bank account. As working 60 hours is easy. It's not. I'm tired. So tired, drew. I said I'd pay it all back. He yelled. I laughed. When? Well, when? My art gallery. If you had to choose now, what would it be? My surgery or your gallery? Drew stood there with his mouth gaping open, acting as if it was a difficult question. I can't believe you're making me choose. That's, um, gaslighting. Choose. Drew paced back and forth nervously. This isn't fair. My mentor said this gallery could really change everything for me. Uh, for us. I said, choose. I'll come check on you after my show. He took my wallet from my back and walked out. I sobbed.

Three years ago, when I first met my husband, Greg's mother, Mallory, she made her famous tuna casserole with crushed potato chips and mayonnaise that had definitely seen better days. The smell alone made my stomach turn. But she stood there watching me take that first bite with such hopeful eyes. I couldn't crush her heart like that. So I smiled, forced it down, and said it was delicious. That single moment of kindness became my prison. Now, three years into our marriage, edge, Mallory brings food over twice a week, always in those same vintage Tupperware containers she's had since the 70s. When she brings her surprise meatloaf that tastes like cardboard soaked in ketchup, I order meatloaf from the diner and carefully transfer it to her containers. I'm spending $200 a month just to maintain the charade. Things started unraveling two weeks ago when Mallory announced she was entering a cooking competition at the community center and wanted me to be her sous chef and taste tester. She's been coming over more frequently, sometimes unannounced, bringing practice dishes. Greg's been acting strange about it, too. Overly enthusiastic, constantly asking if I'm excited about spending more. I'm with his mother, watching me eat with this weird intensity. His eyes literally track every bite from fork to mouth, and he keeps asking, isn't it amazing? Don't you wish you could have this every day? My stomach Turns every time. Yesterday, he came home early and almost caught me transferring Thai food into Mallory's green bean casserole dish. I had to pretend I was just freshening up the presentation. My hands were shaking so badly, I nearly dropped the whole thing. He stood there for a full minute, just staring at me with a strange smile before saying, you really do love her cooking, don't you? But here's what's really odd. Greg's been having hushed phone conversations that end abruptly when I enter the room. Last week, I heard him say something about measuring the guest room and February move in date. When I asked about it, he said he was helping a coworker with furniture dimensions. He's also been weirdly insistent about us decluttering the spare bedroom, saying we need to make space. It's for new possibilities. Yesterday I found him in there with a tape measure and a notebook sketching what looked like furniture placement. When I walked in, he slammed the notebook shut and practically shoved me out, saying it was a surprise and I'd ruin everything if I kept snooping. Mallory's been dropping hints, too, asking about local doctors, the nearest grocery stores, whether our street gets loud quickly in winter. But if I ever tried to ask more questions, he'd shut me down instantly. Then one day, I woke up with food poisoning from this sketchy replacement Chinese food I had the day before and ran to the bathroom through the window. I saw Greg in the backyard on the phone, and his voice carry clearly in the morning. Quiet. Mom, I know you're excited about surprising her, but maybe we should tell her before my blood went cold. Tell me about what? He continued. I know I said February, but if you win this competition, it would be the perfect Celebration to announce your moving in. She loves your cooking so much. She'll be thrilled to have you here full time. Wait, moving in was my mother in law moving in, and my husband was just letting it happen? I stayed frozen, listening to him reassure his mother that I would definitely want her living with us, that I'm always saying how much I miss her between visits. The competition is tomorrow, and Mallory texted that she's bring

My coworker slides me $200 cash during lunch and whispers, I need you to be my boyfriend tomorrow. Just for four hours. It's my cousin's wedding. I almost choked on my sandwich. She's never talked to me about anything beyond spreadsheets and deadline complaints. Now she's offering me money to fake date her? She explains fast. Look, my whole family keeps asking why I'm still single. My mom calls every Sunday to remind me I'm 32 with no prospects. I just need someone normal to shut them up. Plus, you have that one good suit. The wedding's tomorrow at 2 p m. She promises another 200 after. You just have to hold my hand, laugh at my dad's jokes, and don't get too drunk. Easy money. Four hours of free food and pretending to like someone I already think is pretty cool. The cash would cover my car payment. Sure, why not? She looks relieved, like she was expecting me to say no, thank you. Seriously, you're saving my life here. Saturday morning, she picks me up in a BMW I didn't know she had. She's nervous, talking fast about the rules. We've been dating three months, met at work. That part's true. You love hiking. Because my mom will love that you went to State University. Don't mention your ex. Actually, don't mention any ex at all. She's gripping the steering wheel so tight, her knuckles Are white. Something's bothering her beyond normal. Fake date nerves. The venue is fancy. Way fancier than I expected. Valet parking, ice sculptures, a string quartet playing by the entrance. This isn't some backyard wedding. This is money. She grabs my hand really tight as we walk in, her palms sweating. Just stick close to me, okay? Some people here are complicated. We enter the cocktail area, and my chest tightens. I recognize faces in the crowd. This one guy by the bar is one of my ex's best friends, who always hosted those poker nights. This other guy is talking to someone near the fountain. He's my ex's friend from college who's always tagged with her in beach photos. Made me jealous every time. Then this girl walks by in a bridesmaid dress. She was my ex's roommate senior year. The one who told her I wasn't good enough. My stomach drops. These aren't random people. This is my ex's entire friend circle. Circle? Every person who watched our relationship explode. Hey, whose wedding is this exactly? I ask. She pulls me forward. My cousin Taylor's. Come on. Ceremony starting. Taylor. My ex's name is Taylor. We sit down in the fourth row. I'm scanning in the crowd, recognizing more faces. People who unfriended me after the breakup. I'm sweating through my good suit. Then the music starts. The wedding march. Everyone stands. The bride walks out. It's her. My ex. When I found in our bed with someone Else, two years ago. The one I was going to propose to. She's wearing the kind of dress she used to show me in magazines. My coworker squeezes my hand. You okay? You look pale. I can't speak. Can't move, can't breathe. Taylor looks beautiful, happy, glowing in a way she never did with me. The grooms, tall, everything. I'm not. After the ceremony, we're at cocktail hour. I'm Downing champagne like water, trying to stay calm. My coworker stays glued to my side, introducing me to aunts and uncles. This is my boyfriend. Three months now. He's wonderful playing the part, but dying inside. Then Taylor appears with the groom. Oh, my god, is that you? My coworker jumps in fast. Babe, you know the bride? Taylor's face cycles through emotions. Shock, confusion, something else. We. We dated years ago. Small world, my coworker says. Way too cheerful. We should get drinks sometime.

During a dinner celebrating us signing a lease on a brand new home, my wife dropped the bomb that she was quitting her job. I want to be a trad wife, she said out of the blue. I thought it was a joke until she pulled up her Instagram, where she had already made an extensive post about how amazing of a husband I was for agreeing to work two jobs to pay for the mortgage. The next morning, Katie quit her nursing job with no notice. By the end of the week, she'd gone full traditional. Wouldn't drive, wouldn't work, wouldn't make financial decisions. She also wouldn't answer the door for deliveries, claiming that was a man's job. So my expensive work equipment got stolen off our porch. she refused to sign for my certified mail from the IRS about a tax because traditional wives don't handle business matters. I got fined $8,000 for missing the deadline. Then my brother got into a severe car accident 40 minutes away. Single dad. His kids were at school and needed to be picked up. In two hours, he was unconscious and I was stuck in a mandatory meeting at work that I'd be fired for leaving. Katie, please, just this once, pick up the kids from school and drive them to the hospital. Traditional wives don't drive, she said, arranging flowers she picked from our garden. It's not feminine. They're 8 and 10 years old. They'll be standing outside school alone. Maybe their mother should have thought about that before divorcing your brother. My brother's kids waited outside their school until child services pick them up. The investigation lasted months. He nearly lost custody because of child abandonment while he was literally in a coma. I remember begging her to stop. She could be traditional and still use her frontal lobe, but nope, because two weeks later, our house caught fire. She was in the kitchen and left the stove on by accident. Extinguisher was literally in the corner next to her. But instead of grabbing it, she ran outside and called me. Traditional wives don't handle emergencies. That's the man's job. By the time firefighters arrived, half the kitchen was destroyed. 20,000 in damages. Insurance investigated why she didn't attempt to put out a containable fire, and our premiums tripled. That was when I finally snapped. You want traditional? Fine. She gleamed with excitement until I opened our banking app. I'm closing your access to our joint account. Her head snapped up. What? Traditional wives don't have their own bank accounts. They get allowances. My grandfather gave my grandmother $10 a week in 1960. Adjusted for inflation, that's $100 a month. That's insane. That's traditional. That evening, she was planning a Friday night out with the girls. Apparently, that's traditional. I'll need an Uber to downtown. Probably $30 each way. Traditional wives don't go to Bars without their husbands? That's inappropriate. It's just drinks with friends. My grandmother never went anywhere without my grandfather after six PM. Very traditional. She ended up canceling. Her father's 70th birthday was the next week, and her whole family had planned a surprise party for months. But when Saturday came, I had to work. I can't take you. I said, so you can't go. She had no car and missed it. Her father cried when he realized she wasn't coming. Her mother called her selfish. When Katie's grandmother was dying in hospice, Katie came to me crying, please, I need money for an Uber. Just this once. She's asking for me. Traditional wives don't handle money. I reminded her you said modern women's financial independence destroyed marriages. Remember your Instagram post? Her grandmother died a 30 minute drive away while Katie sat at home. Then her brother's wedding invitation arrived. Destination wedding in Mexico. Katie begged for her

I came into the emergency room clutching my abdomen. In the same hospital I once worked as chief of surgery. After two hours, I finally got to see Doctor Harm, who barely glanced up at me and sighed like I'd interrupted something by being here. Let me guess, he said before I could speak. You're 90 years old, ate dinner too late, and now you're panicking. On a scale of one to 10, how bad is your imaginary emergency? When I said eight, he actually laughed. Right. Everyone says eight. Real pain doesn't let you walk in here in your pajamas looking so put together. My pajamas were soaked with sweat from the pain. When did you last have your period? He asked with a smirk. When I said I was postmenopausal, he nodded like he'd solved everything. There you go. Hormones. They make women your age think every little cramp is a heart attack or appendicitis. You tried yoga? Maybe losing some weight? He typed something without examining me. I see a lot of hysterical women your age. Retirement gives you too much time to obsess over every little ache. I tried to explain that I knew my body, but he interrupted, ma'am, I have actual emergencies to deal with. Young man next door got stabbed. That's real medicine. Your psychosomatic belly ache can be handled by your GP on Monday. He started to leave, but I grabbed the rails of The bed, please. Something's wrong. I can feel it. He pried my fingers off one by one. This is drug seeking behavior. Are you here for pain pills? Because that's not happening. A nurse came in and harm told her loudly. Just anxiety. Probably wants attention. Her husband probably doesn't listen to her anymore, so she comes here for someone to talk to. He didn't know. My husband died two years ago in this very hospital. Don't waste resources on blood work. Give her some antacids and discharge papers. The nurse looked uncertain, but he snapped. Did I stutter, or do you want to be a doctor now, too? When I asked for a different doctor, he got nastier. You want a doctor shop? Classic drug seeking. I'm noting this in your file. He pulled up my chart on the computer. Oh, look, you've been here before. Frequent flyer. Lonely old women love the attention from young doctors. It's pathetic, but common. He didn't scroll down far enough to see my employment history at this hospital. The pain was getting worse and I doubled over, which made him roll his eyes dramatically. The performance isn't necessary. I've seen better acting from kindergarteners. He called another resident over. Watch this. Classic case of Munchausen's in the elderly. They Google symptoms and then pretend to have them. The president looked uncomfortable but stayed quiet. She probably lives alone. Kids don't visit, so she creates drama. I started describing my symptoms in medical Terms, hoping it would help. The pain is intermittent, positional with guarding in the upper quadrant. He cut me off. Oh, great. You watch Grey's anatomy and think you're a doctor now? Let me guess, you diagnose yourself on Webmd. He turned to the nurse. She's using medical words she doesn't understand. Probably reads medical forums all day. These board housewives always think they have whatever disease is trending on Facebook. When I stood up to leave and find another hospital, I collapsed from the pain. Instead of helping, he stood over me and said, this manipulation won't work. Get up. You're taking a bed from someone who actually needs it. He didn't help me up, just watched as I struggled. In my professional opinion, you need a psychiatrist, not an ER. Maybe some friends, hobby, anything besides wasting our time. He grabbed my arm roughly to pull me up, and I cried out, stop the theatrics! I'm documenting this as a psych case. You'll be lucky if insurance covers this visit when I'm done. He started dictating to his phone. Patient presents with fabricated symptoms, drug seeking behavior and hysteria typical of menopausal women seeking attention. He looked at me with disgust. Women like

My cousin Brianna sent out the most insane wedding invitation I've ever seen. Under the dress code, in bold letters, it said, no female guests. This includes family members, plus ones, and children. Male attendees only. I thought it was a typo until she called me personally. I know it seems harsh, she said, but I need my wedding day to be about me. Other women always steal attention. This is my solution. I tried reasoning with her. Brianna, your own mother can't come to your wedding. She'll understand. Besides, she always cries and makes everything about her emotions. Real reason came out after 20 minutes of talking. Brianna was convinced that her fiance, Jerome, would leave her for someone prettier. She'd caught him liking other women's photos online and decided the only solution was to eliminate all competition from her big day. The family was in uproar. Her mother sobbed for days. Her three sisters were devastated. Even Jerome's mother was banned. But Brianna wouldn't budge. She hired all male vendors. Male photographer, male caterers, male florist. She even found a male makeup artist to do her hair and makeup. Two weeks before the wedding, I got a call from Jerome's best man, Terrell. This is insane. He's. Jerome's trying to support her, but his mom is threatening to disown him. Can't you talk sense into her? I tried one more time. Brianna just said, either support my Decision or don't come to the reception. Yes, she was allowing women at the reception, just not the ceremony, because that made sense in her world. The day of the wedding arrived. I wasn't there, obviously, but Terrell live streamed it for the banned women in a group chat. The venue looked beautiful, but eerily empty. Thirty men sat awkwardly in a space meant for 200. No one knew where to look or what to say. Then came the professional. Brianna had no bridesmaids, so she walked alone. The music started, the doors opened, and in walked nobody. The music played for a full minute while everyone stared at the empty doorway. Jerome started sweating. The efficient looked confused. Terrell ran to check. He found Brianna in the bridal suite, locked in the bathroom, having a complete meltdown. Her male makeup artist had given her what she called drag queen makeup. Her hair was teased into a massive Buffon. She looked like she was competing in a pageant from 1987 without any women around to help fix it. She'd been trying to redo everything herself and made it worse. But that wasn't why she was really crying. Through the door. She admitted the truth. I've been so focused on keeping women away that I forgot this meant I'd have nobody to share this with. No mother daughter moment, no sisters helping with my dress. I'm completely alone on the most important day of my life. Jerome went to talk To her, we could hear him through Terrell's phone. Baby, this. It's crazy. You banned my mother? Your mother? What are we doing? I just didn't want you looking at other women, she sobbed. I'm looking at other women every day because you made this wedding into a circus! Everyone's talking about the bride who banned women, not the bride I'm marrying. You created the exact attention you were trying to avoid. She finally came out an hour later, makeup streaked, hair deflated. They did a quick ceremony with just the officiant, Jerome Terrell, and Brianna's father, who looked like he wanted to disappear here. The reception was even worse. All the band women showed up, but the atmosphere was ice cold. Brianna tried to act like nothing happened, but everyone knew. Her mother sat in the corner crying. Her sisters left after 15 minutes.

We've been together two years. Last month, his college girlfriend Madison died from cancer at just 26. They'd broken up five years ago, but stayed friends on social media. I'd always felt a little weird about their friendship, but I trusted him completely. He was absolutely devastated when she passed. Took a week off work, barely ate anything. Just lay in bed scrolling through old photos of them together. I tried being supportive, making his favorite meals, bringing him tea, giving him space when he needed it. Then he started talking about her constantly. Madison always made the best lasagna from scratch with her grandmother's recipe. Madison would have absolutely loved this movie. She had such incredible taste in everything. Madison understood my twisted sense of humor better than anyone ever has or probably ever will. At first I thought it was completely normal grief. People reminisce about lost friends all the time, right? I figured he'd work through it naturally, but it escalated really quickly. He began comparing literally everything I did to Madison. When I cooked dinner, he'd mention how Madison's version was somehow better. When I laughed at his jokes, he'd say Madison's laugh was more genuine and musical. When I wore certain outfits, he comment that Madison had better style sense. It got really weird when he asked me to dye my hair blonde like Madison's had been. Said it would help him feel closer to those happy memories during this in readily difficult time in his life. I refused Point Blank. He got genuinely upset, accused me of being selfish and unsupportive during his grief. Said a truly loving girlfriend would understand what he was going through and try to help him heal properly. That hurt deeply, but I tried to stay patient. Everyone grieves differently, and I didn't want to be the terrible girlfriend who couldn't handle her boyfriend mourning a friend. Last week, I found him at two a m. Sitting at our kitchen table, writing intensely in a leather journal I'd never seen before, page after page about Madison. How she was his true soulmate and the only woman who truly understood his deepest soul. He wrote things like, I made the biggest mistake of my life letting her go, and I settled for someone lesser because I was terrified of real, assuming love. I was reading over his shoulder in the dark hallway when he finally noticed me standing there. He slammed the journal shut and got incredibly defensive. Said it was private therapy and I was serious, seriously violating his personal boundaries. The absolute final straw was yesterday evening. We're at dinner with his parents at their favorite Italian restaurant, when his mom casually mentions that Madison had sent her a lasagna recipe years ago. He immediately tears up and says, I'll never love anyone the way I loved her. She was absolutely Perfect in every single way imaginable. His dad looked completely horrified. His mom tried desperately changing the subject to the web.

And now that I'm rich, he demands that I give him our house and support him for the rest of his life. I was 15 when my parents died. No family ended up on the streets until a government program gave me housing and half minimum wage until 18. When that ended, I couldn't get work because I had no address. Finally got a job at a diner making almost nothing. That's where I met Cody, my now husband. He was a regular customer and we talked for hours. Six months later, I moved in with him. His dad hated me from day one. Called me worthless, said I'd drag his son down. I paid their rent, bills, groceries. Saved every penny for our future. Didn't matter. Daily insults, constant judgment. Street rat. He'd call me at dinner. My son deserves better than some homeless girl. Cody would defend me, but his dad would just laugh. She's using you, son. Mark my words. I worked doubles at the diner while Cody did construction. Every night I'd come home exhausted to more criticism. Still smell like grease. His dad would sneer, this is what failure looks like. The worst part? I genuinely tried to win him over. Cooked his favorite meals, cleaned the house spotless. Even bought him birthday gifts with money I could barely spare. Nothing worked. One Christmas. I saved for months to buy him a nice watch. He opened it, looked gusted, and said, I don't need charity from a charity case. Then he threw it in the trash right in front of me. Cody's friends would come over, and his dad would introduce me as the homeless girl Cody's wasting his time with. I'd sit there humiliated while everyone looked at me with pity. One night, we came home from a date, and he wouldn't let us in. Said he'd sold our clothes and stolen our savings. I won't support two losers who'll never succeed. We slept in my car that night. Cody cried. First time I'd ever seen him break down. I'm sorry, he kept saying. I should have stood up to him sooner. Got a tiny room near the diner. Cody found work. The room was so small, we had to take turns getting dressed. Ate a ramen for months, but we were finally free. We took a loan, opened our own small restaurant. After hours, Cody would cook while I waited tables. We'd work our day jobs, then run to our place until midnight. The first year was brutal. Barely breaking even, working 16 hour days, sleeping four hours a night. His dad would drive by sometimes just to laugh at us through the window. But slowly, customers started coming back. Word spread. Local food blogger gave us five stars. Lines started forming outside. We hired our first employee, a kid from The streets like me. Then another. Cody insisted we pay above minimum wage. Everyone deserves a real chance, he'd say. Years passed. That one restaurant became five, then 10. We built an empire. Cody proposed in our flagship restaurant. You turn my life around, he said. Let's make it official. His dad wasn't invited to the wedding. We had two kids, Sophia and Frederick. Cody turned into the most incredible father. I want to be everything my dad wasn't, he'd say while reading them bedtime stories. Our company went public three years ago. We're worth about 50 million now. Bought a mansion in the hills with a pool the kids love. Cody's mom visits sometimes. Divorced his dad years ago and finally admits he was always horrible.

But I went along with it and watched her and her lawyer embarrass themselves in front of the judge. We split custody fifty fifty when we divorced 3 years ago. Same salaries, same time with our 5 year old daughter, so no child support needed. That was the deal we both signed off on. But my ex got greedy. She quit her job to find herself enrolled in some online marketing course, then dropped out after two months when it got hard. Suddenly she's blowing up my phone demanding $200 monthly because I control my finances better than her. I laughed it off until her lawyer contacted me. Fine. I thought, let's play this game. Here's what she didn't know. I'm meticulous with records. Every receipt, every bank statement, every expense tracked to the penny. And color coded bed sheets. It's literally how I survived our messy divorce. Her lawyer filed the case without requesting my actual income. They just guessed based on my old job from two years ago and guessed wrong. They estimated I made 30% more than reality and had half my actual expenses. Basic mistake number one. Meanwhile, I'm gathering evidence like I'm building a criminal case. Stubs, rent receipts, grocery bills, medical co pays, our daughter's dance class fees, everything organized by date and category. As we approached court, my lawyer called with an update. Her attorney figured out She'd been lying about her financial situation and wanted to settle immediately. She doesn't want to go to court anymore, he said, barely containing his laughter. But my ex refused the settlement. She was convinced she'd win because judges always side with the mom. Court day arrives. Sitting there in my best suit, folder full of evidence, watching her strut in like she owns the place. The judge reviews both our financial statements side by side. I watch his expression change from neutral to confused to visibly annoyed. Plot twist after calculating everything properly, she actually had more disposable income than me. Way more. Her unemployment benefits, plus child tax credits, plus help from her new boyfriend, plus the side gig she forgot to mention. It all added up. The judge looked directly at her. Ma'am, you're asking him to pay support when you have $400 more per month than available income? Her lawyer literally face palmed and started shuffling papers like he was looking for an escape route. But it gets exponentially better. She'd submitted completely falsified bank statements as supporting evidence, claiming she only had $75 in total savings. The judge caught the deception immediately. Dates didn't match the statement periods, dollar amounts were clearly altered with correction fluid. The bank routing numbers were from a completely different financial institution. Ma'am, are you fully aware that knowingly submitting false evidence to this court constitutes perjury, which is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison? The Judge asked, his voice absolutely ice cold. My ex Heather went completely pale and start

So I got the perfect revenge. She crashed our cabin weekend claiming her Airbnb fell through. I knew it was BS the moment she showed up with a perfectly packed bag and a smug smile. My boyfriend Joseph felt bad for her and invited her to stay without even asking me. For three days straight, she kept creating these elaborate situations to make me look like the worst girlfriend ever. Like when she helped make dinner on Friday night. She volunteered to preheat the oven while I prepped ingredients. Everything seemed normal until I put our carefully marinated steaks in and they came out completely charred. She acted shocked when Joseph got mad at me for ruining our expensive dinner. Later, I noticed she'd secretly cranked the oven to 500 degrees. Saturday morning, she suggested we go hiking to this amazing waterfall she'd been to for. She gave me detailed directions to the trailhead while she rode with Joseph. Turns out she sent me to the wrong trail entirely. I spent two hours lost in the woods with no cell service while they bonded over waiting for me. When I finally found them at the actual trailhead, Joseph was visibly annoyed I'd kept them waiting. She just shrugged and said, oh, I guess I mixed up the directions. My bad. The manipulation got worse as the weekend went on. She kept doing this thing where she'd bring up inside jokes and memories from before I existed, making me. I feel like an outsider in my own relationship. Remember when we did this? And remember when we did that? Always with this little smile directed at me. She'd also accidentally brush against Joseph, constantly grab his arm when laughing, and find excuses to lean over him. During Saturday afternoon, we decided to go swimming in the lake. She conveniently forgot to pack a swimsuit and asked to borrow one of mine. The one she picked was my smallest bikini, and she made sure to comment loudly about how loose it was on her while adjusting it right in front of Joseph. Then she suggested we play volleyball in the water and kept accidentally bumping into me, making me lose my balance. The breaking point was Saturday night, we were all sitting by the fire when she pretended to be drunk and started crying about how much she missed the old days before I came along and changed everything. She was literally sobbing into Joseph's shoulder about how their friend group was never the same, how she felt like she was losing her best friend, and how things used to be so much. My boyfriend was actually comforting her, rubbing her back, and telling her nothing had changed between them. That's when I noticed something crucial. All weekend, she'd been taking tons of photos with Joseph's phone and hers, documenting every Moment. But I realized she was only capturing me when I looked terrible. Messy hair from hiking, unflattering angle while eating, caught mid chew, or when I was frustrated and arguing. Meanwhile, every single photo of her was perfectly posed and filtered. So while she was in the bathroom touching up her makeup for the 10th time that day, I grabbed her phone. She'd left it unlocked on the counter next to the sink. I scrolled through her camera roll and found the absolute worst photo she'd taken all weekend of herself. Double chin, eyes half closed, food stuck in her teeth, hair a complete disaster. It was from when she was laughing too hard at one of Joseph's jokes and snorting. I posted it to her Instagram story.

I need to be practical about my future. After she pulled out a prenup that could leave me with nothing. Allison and I had been together three years, engaged for six months, with our wedding planned for four months away. I'm a software engineer making $120,000. She works in marketing making $75,000. We. We're supposed to close on our first house in two weeks. I was contributing thirty five thousand dollars of the fifty thousand dollar down payment. Last Sunday she invited me to dinner at her parents upscale home. Her mom had prepared an elaborate spread and her dad, Greg was being unusually friendly, asking about my work and laughing at my jokes. Normally he treated me politely, but distantly. I thought they were finally accepting me as family. Halfway through dinner, Allison suddenly got this serious, rehearsed look. Sean, I think we should sign a prenuptial agreement before the wedding, she said, pulling out a Manila folder and sliding it across the table. My stuff like dropped. This whole dinner had been a setup. Her parents were nodding along. The prenup demanded complete financial separation. Separate bank accounts, separate credit cards, separate everything. But the real estate clause was the worst part. The house we were buying together would be titled solely in Allison's name. If we divorced, I'd walk away with nothing. Regardless of contributions to mortgage payments or improvement. I'd be paying Allison to live in a house She owned. When I asked why she suddenly wanted this, her mom jumped in. It's just smart financial planning, Sean. Surely someone in your field understands protecting assets. Her dad added, nothing personal, just business. This is how people like us protect what we've built. But when we started house shopping, Allison put for both our names on everything, saying it would show we were truly committed as partners. Now suddenly, she wanted legal separation of everything. I said I needed time to review it with a lawyer. The silence was deafening. A lawyer? Allison's voice pitched higher. I thought you'd be more mature about this. Monday morning, my lawyer, James, reviewed the document. His reaction was immediate. Sean, this is one of the most one sided documents I've ever seen. Don't sign this. He explained I'd pay half the mortgage, taxes, and maintenance on an asset entirely hers if we divorced. This reads like someone already planning for divorce while expecting you to subsidize her life until that happens. So I made two decision. I wouldn't sign the prenup, and I was withdrawing from the house purchase. I called our realtor and removed my name. Since Allison couldn't qualify for the mortgage alone without my contribution, this killed the deal. I also moved my $50,000 from our joint savings back to my personal account. When Allison discovered this, she called screaming, accusing me of sabotaging our relationship. Her family launched desperate attempts to pressure me. Her mother showed up, At my workplace, crying, her father offered to personally guarantee I

I replied, he changed mine, too. She didn't know he was my divorce lawyer. Celine had been acting weird for months. It started small. Suddenly caring about her appearance again, buying new clothes she couldn't afford on her teacher's salary. Then came the secret phone calls, where she'd step outside or lock herself in the bathroom. When I'd ask who called, she get defensive and say it was just her sister. The mysterious meetings were next. Working late at school again, she text. But when I drove by the parking lot at eight PM, her car wasn't there. She'd come home smelling like expensive Cologne and wine, claiming she'd grab dinner with colleagues. I'm not stupid. I knew something was happening. But after eight years together, I figured I owed it to us to try counseling first. That's when I started secretly meeting with Elias Thorn, the best divorce attorney in town. We've been planning my exit strategy for three months. Protecting my business, our joint accounts, the house I bought before we got to together. When she asked to talk last Friday, sitting at our kitchen table with this nervous energy, I knew what was coming. I'm leaving you, she said. And for the first time in months, she looked genuinely happy. I met someone incredible. A successful lawyer who actually understands me. She went on and on about how amazing he was, how intelligent, how sophisticated, how different. From me. He's handling this huge divorce case right now, making tons of money. He took me to that new French place downtown last week. You know, the one with the $200 steaks you said was too expensive. I just sat there, letting her paint this picture of her new life. She was practically glowing as she described their relationship. How he understood her need for finer things, how he made her feel valued and desired. He's taking me to Napa this weekend, she continued, her eyes bright with excitement. Says he's going to change my life forever. We're staying at some resort that costs more per night than you make in a week. The dig was unnecessary, but typical Celine. She'd always resented that I ran a small construction business instead of wearing suits and working in an office. I kept my voice calm and asked, that's nice. What's his name? Elias Thorn. She seemed like she was announcing she'd won the lottery. He's brilliant. Drives an Audi RS six, has this gorgeous office downtown. Everything I've always wanted. My stomach dropped, but I kept my face completely neutral. Elias Thorn wasn't just any lawyer. He was my divorce attorney. The one I've been secretly meeting with every Thursday for three months. The one who knew every detail about our finances, our relationship problems, our joint asset. Sounds great. I managed. When are you leaving? Tonight. He's picking me up at 7. I already packed a bag. She gestured. Toward her suitcase by the door, like she couldn't wait to escape. After she went upstairs to shower and get ready, I sat in my truck and called Elias. Straight to voicemail. I texted, emergency. Need to talk before Monday. Two hours later, while Celine was doing her makeup, he called back.

I watched my mom slowly dying over Facetime for months because I couldn't make enough money to go see her. She wanted to pay for my plane ticket, but I knew she wouldn't be able to afford her treatment if she did. So I begged her not to. I promised I'd come see her soon and started constantly picking up shifts at the restaurant I worked at. But one night, her doctor phoned me telling me he wasn't sure if she had much longer. It started coughing up blood but didn't want me to know so I wouldn't worry. It was then that I realized I wouldn't be able to save enough to go see her in time. I stayed up crying that entire night but still had to go to work the next day. Halfway through my shift, I saw Leonardo DiCaprio come in with who I think was his mom. I could tell he didn't want to be bothered because he had a hat, sunglasses and unshaven. I still knew it was him and just pretended that I didn't realize who he was. This was right after Titanic, so I was completely freaking out inside. I didn't tell anyone and treated him like any other customer as best as I could. However, at the end of the meal, I couldn't resist. Before I brought him the check, I wrote, your movies are awesome, I hope. You like the food on his receipt. When he got up to leave, I could see him looking around and smiled when he saw me. I thought this was the coolest thing ever. And when I went to go clean their table, I saw he wrote back, thank you so much for not blowing my cover and left a 500 dollar tip. At the time, this was so much money, I thought it was an accident. I was about to go run outside to give it back, but he was already gone. I remember feeling like I literally couldn't breathe and just tried to act normal. As soon as my shift ended that day, I booked the next flight out to see my mom. I phoned to tell her I was coming and I literally ran through the hospital to her room. I got there in time to spend her last 20 minutes with her. Because of him, I got to hug my mom one last time as she passed.

My sister announces she has stage 3 lymphoma at family dinner and mom immediately starts crying while dad opens his wallet. Everyone's posting prayers on Facebook. Within minutes, I asked to see medical paperwork and get screamed at for being jealous. Jealous cancer. She launches this 50,000 dollar gofundme for experimental treatment insurance won't cover. And money starts pouring in from strangers, 500 here, thousand there. She's posting daily in grey hoodies with sad selfies and inspirational quotes about fighting. So I noticed she's eating sushi at lunch. Raw fish. You can't eat that on chemo. It'll literally kill you with your immune system gone. I point this out and my family calls me heartless. My, my sister makes this crying TikTok. Even my own sister doesn't support me. I get death threats in my DMS, actual death threats. My cousin texts, you're disgusting. She's dying and you're jealous. Then my sister posts this, quote, you know what hurts more than cancer? Having a sister who wants me dead. My stomach drops. She's turned everyone against me for asking one question, one question about paperwork. My mom won't even look at me at Sunday dinner. My dad says I should apologize for causing stress during her treatment. Treatment, right? Anyway, I start taking screenshots of everything. Tuesday, she posts at chemo all day, but she's tagged at a wine tasting two hours away. That same afternoon. I Screenshot both with time stamps. Then I find her Amazon account still logged in on the family computer. Order history shows real plastic bald cap. Forty seven dollars and ninety nine cents delivered last month. I screenshot the receipt. My hands are shaking. No one will believe me. They'll say I photoshopped it. But I keep going. I check the hospital visitor parking website, the one that validates tickets and it says her license plate never appears in the entire 3 months of her supposed treatment. I call the hospital building department and record the entire call. Legal in my state. They said they had no patient under her name. The woman on the phone sounds confused when I ask again. Meanwhile, my sister posts about chemo brain making her forget things. But that same night she wins a game of trivia at the local bar. She receives a 20 five dollar gift card to Red Lobster. I'm starting to feel crazy. Maybe I'm wrong. But then I see her doing perfect cartwheels in the backyard in the morning. She's training for a 5K. How? However, she'll bring up cancer fatigue anytime the family needs something done. Then her go fund me hits $38,000. I find her Venmo and see she's literally buying designer bags, not medicine. Every purchase was dated after her diagnosis. So I create a folder on my phone, 147 pieces of evidence. Each screenshot feels like an extra layer of armour in my fight to reveal The truth, I became a detective not because I wanted to, because nobody else would. However, my sister announces she's getting a bravery award at my aunt's charity gala. I tried to tell her this gala is for real pediatric cancer patients, kids who are actually dying. She scoffed at me and said she was a real patient, that she deserved this award for everything she had been going through. That's when I decided this ends tomorrow. On gala night, there are 200 guests, including real cancer survivors and sick children. My sister's on the stage in a silk head wrap giving a speech. Cancer taught me that angels walk among us. I noticed the bald cap edge peeking out. When she goes in to hug the mayor, he hands her the award plaque and she starts fake crying, dabbing carefully under her eyes. I walk on stage with my phone. Before we celebrate, can everyone look at the screen? I connect to the projector prearranged with the AV tech up top who lost his mom to actual cancer. The Amazon bald cap receipt appears. My sister's name and address on the big screen for all to see. Gasps. And there's the wine tasting screenshots, her Venmo purchases with gofundme money. Someone drops a champagne glass. My sister's frozen, stammering. This is, you don't understand. I walk up to her. Let's show them what's really under there. I pull off the head wrap, then peel the bald cap off. Perfect. Blonde hair tumbles down. A child in the front row starts crying. Her mother stands up. You stole from dying children. My aunt grabs the microphone. Security escort her out. My sister runs with the cap still dangling from her hand. Turns out the only thing terminal was her credibility.

So in my junior year, I had this horrible cavity that was killing me, but I couldn't get to the dentist for another week. The pain was unbearable. So I started carrying this little bottle of clove oil my mom gave me. If you've never used it, clove oil numbs your gums when you have tooth pain. Anyway, I'm sitting in English class, and this wave of pain hits me. So I pull out my little dropper bottle and put some on my finger, then rub it on my gum. My friend Marcos leans over and whispers, dude, are you taking drugs in class? I explain it's just clove oil for my tooth, and he asks, try it. Because his wisdom teeth were coming in, I let him have a drop, and within minutes, he's like, whoa, this stuff is amazing. By lunch, Marcos had told, like, five people about my magic potion, and they all wanted to try it. The next day, three different people showed up with their own little dropper bottles. One girl had peppermint oil, claiming it helped her focus. Another guy brought lavender oil, saying it calmed his test anxiety. By Wednesday, our chemistry teacher, Missus Patterson, noticed half the class pulling out tiny bottles before the quiz. She stopped the class and asked what was going on. When we explained, instead of shutting it down, she got excited and started talking about aromatherapy and Essential oils Thursday morning the morning announcements included a warning not to share oils because of potential allergies. This obviously made everyone want them more. Friday the hallways smelled like a weird combination of eucalyptus tea tree and something called Thieves Blend that apparently fights germs. The following Monday, some senior girls started wearing those little glass vial necklaces filled with different colored oils. By Wednesday, those necklaces were everywhere. The drama kids started wearing multiple vials color coded to their emotional needs for the day. Red for energy, blue for calm, purple for creativity. The football team got in on it, claiming peppermint oil improved their reaction time. They started rubbing it on their temples before practice. Our principal finally had to call an assembly about proper essential oil etiquette, which is possibly the weirdest assembly topic in school history. Actually made rules like no applying oils during class and no diffusers in lockers because someone had rigged one up with a small fan. The yearbook committee created a two page spread called the year of Essential Enlightenment with photos of students and their favorite oils. They interviewed me as the trend originator and I tried explaining I just had a toothache, but that part never made the final edit. The school nurse eventually started a scent free zone in her office for kids with allergies or sensitivities. The funniest part was parents started complaining about having to buy these expensive oils because their kids insist did they needed Them. The local health food store actually created a student starter kit with five tiny bottles for $25. My dentist finally fixed my cavity, but I kept carrying my clove oil as a weird good luck charm. Even teachers got into it. Our math teacher claimed lemon oil helped her grade papers faster, all because I had a toothache and couldn't get to the dentist. Sometimes the dumbest trends start from the most random necessity. Four years later and my younger sister says kids still bring oils to school, though now they claim it's for focus and emotional support, rather than admitting they're just following a trend that started because of my bad dental hygiene.

I looked at her confused. What trip? I didn't receive anything. My grandmother's face darkened as she turned to my parents. The fifteen thousand dollar graduation trip to Europe I sent for Diego three months ago. The silence was deafening. My mom started fidgeting with her new designer purse, the one that mysteriously appeared last month along with matching shoes. My dad's gold chain suddenly felt heavier around his neck. And I noticed his expensive watch for the first time. We. We thought it would be better if my mom stamp her newly done nails, tapping nervously on the table. If what? Grandma's voice cut like ice. If you stole from your own son. That's when it all clicked. The sudden shopping sprees every weekend. My sister's new iPhone, iPad and MacBook. Family vacation to Cancun that I wasn't invited to. A kitchen renovation. Dad's new motorcycle sitting in our driveway. They'd stolen my graduation gift and spent it on themselves like it was Christmas morning. My sister Estania, who never worked a day in her life, was wearing earrings that cost more than my monthly gas station salary. Diamond studs that sparkled under the restaurant lights. She and even look up from her plate, too busy admiring her fresh manicure. You gave them everything their entire lives, I said quietly, my voice shaking with years of suppressed anger. And they took the One thing meant for me. The one thing I actually earned. Grandma stood up, her chair scraping against the floor loud enough to make nearby diners turn. 20 years I've watched you favor Estania over Diego like he's invisible. I sent that money specifically for him. With a letter explaining every detail of the trip I planned. My mom's face went white as paper. We never got a letter, I swear. Because you threw it away after cashing the check that had his name on it. The restaurant felt silent, despite other diners around us. Even the waiters seemed to sense the drama unfolding at our table. I couldn't hold back anymore. This explains everything. Why you suddenly had money for mom's Botox appointment and weekly spa days. Why dad bought that Harley Davidson he's been wanting for years. Why Estania got her nose job and started posting Instagram photos from five star hotels every single week. My grandmother's eyes widened with each revelation. Nose job? Instagram photos? Show me. I pulled out my phone and showed her Estania's recent posts. Bullside shots at luxury resorts in Miami. Designer shopping halls from Rodeo Drive. First class plane seats with champagne glasses. Expensive restaurant meals that cost more than I made in a week. All time stamped from the past three months. Right after my graduation, I've been working 70 hour weeks at the gas station just to afford my rent and groceries. I continued my voice, getting stronger, eating ramen Noodles for dinner. While watching them feast like royalty, I thought maybe you'd forgotten about my graduation. Or maybe you were disappointed in me. But this whole time, they were living off money meant for me. Grandma scrolled through the photos, her face getting redder with each. This hotel cost $800 a night. I know because I stayed there last year. And this restaurant, their appetizers start at $50. My dad tried to interrupt, loosening his collar nervously. Mom, if you'd just let us explain the situation. Explain what, Nelson? How you forged my grandson's signature on bank documents? How you intercepted mail addressed specifically to him? How you've been lying to my face for months while spending his money? She reached into her purse and pulled out a thick envelope with legal documents. I brought copies of everything. Bank transfer with Diego's name, the hotel reservations in his name, the flight confirmations, the detailed itinerary. I spent weeks planning for his graduation gift. My mom started crying. But not the sorry kind of crying. The angry, caught kind, where she knew her game was over. You always liked him more than Estonia anyway, ever since they were kids. Because he works for everything he has. Grandma slammed the envelope on the table, making the wine glasses shake. While you've raised a spoiled princess who thinks the world owes her everything just for existing. Estonia finally spoke, her voice shaky and small. I didn't know it was Diego's money. I Swear! I thought it was just family money. Bullshit, I said, surprising myself with how calm and controlled I sounded. You knew exactly what you were doing when you posted those photos and tagged them. Living my best life while I was pulling double shifts and sleeping four hours a night. Other diners were definitely staring now, but I didn't care anymore. Years of being invisible in my own family was finally coming to an end. Grandma opened her purse and pulled out her phone with steady hands. I'm calling my lawyer tomorrow morning. Every penny gets repaid within 30 days, or I'm pressing charges for theft and fraud. My parents started begging, their voices overlapping and desperate. Please. But he was already walking away toward the exit. As she hugged me goodbye in the parking lot, she whispered, pack your bags. Tonight you're coming to live with me and finishing that master's degree you wanted. I'm also buying you that Europe trip again. And this time, you're actually going. The next morning, they found out grandma had already frozen their access to all her accounts. The repo man showed up for Dad's motorcycle by noon, and the bank called about their overdue credit card payments by evening.

This house is going up for sale. Everyone cheered and raised their glasses. I stepped outside and made one phone call. Ten minutes later, the screaming started. See, two years ago, when dad had his heart attack, I discovered something. They were three months behind on mortgage payment. The bank was for closing next week. My family had no idea. Dad was too proud to tell anyone. So I used my entire divorce settlement, $180,000, to buy the house at auction. I created an LLC called Clearwater Holdings and let them keep living there without telling them. I figured I'd transfer it back once they got stable again. Now my brother Marcus thinks he can just sell it and split the money. He's already called two realtors. The irony wasn't lost on me. For two years, I've been quietly paying property taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs. Every time something broke, I'd anonymously arrange for repairs. The new roof last spring. That was me. The HVAC system that mysteriously got warranty coverage. Also me. Marcus had been living rent free in a house I owned, while constantly reminding everyone how successful he was compared to his loser sister. When I walked back inside, he was drawing renovation plans on napkins with his wife Jennifer. We could add a wine cellar, he was saying, gesturing wildly with his beer. And a home theater, Jennifer added, her eyes practically glowing with dollar signs. Mom was nodding enthusiastically. Oh, and we could finally get that kitchen island I've always wanted. Dad sat quietly in his chair, looking uncomfortable but not saying anything. He'd always hated confrontation. My teenage nephew, Tyler was on his phone, probably already shopping for the car Marcus had promised him from his inheritance share. Actually, I said calmly, walking back to the dining room table, I need to tell you something important. Marcus didn't even look up from his sketching. If you're gonna beg us to let you stay, save it, he laughed. Decisions made. Jenny already found us a realtor friend who can get us top dollar. Really? I said, sitting down across from him. That's interesting, because I just got off the phone with my attorney. Mom rolled her eyes dramatically. Alex, Honey, you can't afford an attorney. Stop being so dramatic about this. James Morrison from Morrison and Associates, I continued, ignoring her comment. He specializes in real estate law. Dad finally looked up with interest. Why were you talking to a real estate attorney, sweetheart? Because I wanted to understand what happens when someone tries to sell a house they don't legally own. The room went completely silent. Even Tyler looked up from his phone. Marcus's pen stopped moving. What are you talking about? Mom and dad own this house. They've lived here for 30 years. They lived here for 30 years, I corrected calmly. But they haven't owned it for the past 14 months. Dad's Face had gone completely pale. Alex, what are you saying? I pulled out my phone and opened the email James had sent me. According to the county property records, this house is owned by Clearwater Holdings, LLC. It was purchased at foreclosure auction 14 months ago for $165,000. Marcus stood up so fast, his chair nearly fell over. That's impossible. There's no way. The original owners, Robert and Margaret

So you remember, you're not part of this family. While dad laughed hysterically. I'm 29. Always been the odd one out in the Peterson family. Different hair, different build, different everything. They joke about the mailman constantly. So when Sarah handed me that DNA kit with a smirk in time to prove what we all know, I wasn't even surprised. Dad was cracking up, mom nodding like she'd been waiting years for this moment. Fine, I said, but let's make it interesting. How about we all take DNA tests? You know, for science. The room went quiet. Sarah laughed nervously. Why would we need to? Because I already took one six months ago, I said, pulling out my phone. And according to 23 and me, I have a half sister named Jessica who's been looking for her biological family. I showed them Jessica's profile. Same last name as Mom's Maiden name. Same distinctive birthmark mom has on her wrist. Jessica was born nine months after Mom's business trip to Chicago in 1995. Remember that trip, mom? The one where you couldn't be reached for three days? Mom's face went white. Dad stopped laughing immediately. Oh, it gets better. I continued scrolling through my phone. Jessica wasn't the only surprise. I have three half siblings from Mom's various work conferences. I showed them photos. This is Michael from Denver, born in 1998. Ring any bells about that marketing seminar you Attended alone. Sarah grabbed the phone. That's not possible. And here's little Emma from Portland, born in 2,001. Funny how she has the same rare eye condition as Mom. Dad's face was turning red, but not from laughter anymore. Linda, what the hell is this? Best part? I pulled out a thick envelope from my jacket. I've been in contact with all three of them for months. They all want to meet their biological mother. In fact, they're driving here right now. Mom stood up shakily. You didn't. I did. Jessica should be here in about an hour. Michael's flying in from Denver tonight. Emma's parents are bringing her tomorrow morning for Christmas brunch. I looked at Sarah, who was still holding the DNA kit. So tell me again about not being part of this family. Because it looks like you're about to have a lot more family than you bargained for. Dad was staring at mom like he'd never seen her before. 26 years, Linda. 26 years of marriage, and you've been lying about three children. Actually, I said, checking my messages. Make that four. Just got a DNA match notification this morning. Apparently, there's a David from Miami who's also looking for answers. The doorbell rang. Through the window, I could see a young woman with mom's exact nose and chin standing on our porch holding a wrapped present. That'll be Jessica, I said, walking toward the door. I told her we were having a family reunion. Sarah, Finally found her voice. You plan this whole thing? You gave me six months to prepare. After I took that DNA test, I shrug. Did you really think I'd just sit on information this explosive? I opened the door. Jessica, come in. Meet your biological family. Jessica walked in looking exactly like mom did in old photos. Hi, everyone! I'm so excited to finally meet you all. The silence was deafening. Dad was gripping his chair so hard, his knuckles were white. Mom looked like she might faint.

I grew up an army brat. Moving every couple of years was just part of life. By the time I hit high school, I'd already attended more schools than I could count. But somehow I'd managed to stay in one place from eighth grade all the way to junior year. That was the longest stretch of stability I'd ever had. My senior year, though, I knew I'd be moving across the ocean. I was used to leaving friends behind, but honestly, I was looking forward to the change. At the time, I was in the high school band. For my first two years, we had this amazing director and a teacher who was supportive, encouraging, and tough when it mattered. Everyone loved her. But she left, and her replacement was the complete opposite. He was mean, short tempered, and ruled with an iron fist. Nobody liked him, but we all just tolerated it. One afternoon near the end of junior year, I had a dentist appointment. Totally routine, just fixing a cavity before my family's big move. The appointment happened to overlap with band class. I did the responsible thing. I told the director I'd be out. Checked out of school, went to the dentist, and that was that. Or so I thought. The next morning, my bandmate swarmed me. Hey, did you hear what Mister B said yesterday? I hadn't, so they filled me in. Apparently, while I was gone, he launched into a tirade about selfish students who weren't dedicated enough to prioritize. Band went on and on about how people who missed class for trivial things like a medical appointment were ruining the group. 80 kids sat there while he waved his arms and raised his voice, and every single one of them knew exactly who he was talking about. Me. Now, I wasn't a troublemaker. I had a 3.9 GPA. I yes, sir and no, ma'am to adults. I followed rules, but I also had a strong sense of justice. And this. This was unfair. So I marched right up to him and said, I hear you don't want people who schedule appointments during class. Effective immediately, I'm no longer in your band. I'll find another class to finish out the year. His face went beat red, veins bulged. He started shouting that he was the one in charge, that I couldn't leave his class without his permission. But this. It wasn't class time. I didn't have to stand there, so I just walked out. I went to one of my favorite teachers, Coach N, who also taught art history during that same period. I explained the situation, and without hesitation, he said I was welcome to join his class. All I needed was the principal's approval. So I went to the office, explained everything, and the principal said, we need a meeting with my parents and Mister B before making it Official fine by me. That afternoon, though, I was told I had to go back to band until the meeting happened. That's when the malicious compliance kicked in. If Mister B insisted I stay, I'd stay. But on my terms. I walked into band class, sat down in my front row seat. I was first chair oboe. Folded my hands in my lap. I didn't take out my instrument. I didn't touch my music. For 90 minutes, I just sat there silently staring at him. Day two, same thing. No instrument, no music. Just me silently refusing to play. He thought he could break me by threatening my grade. But I already made peace with it. When the meeting finally happened, Mister B tried to push the idea that I needed to stay. He even said smugly, if I don't let you out of my class, you'll fail the principal

My mom had two rules that she drilled into me since I was 8 years old. Never mention dad to anyone. Never use our real last name. Your dad was a bad man, an evil man. If he finds you, he'll hurt us both, she'd tell me. It confused me because he always seemed friendly. But now, because of him, we were constantly on the run, moving to a new school every year, using a new name, wearing a new personality to match. When I was a bit older, mom explained in detail how dad was in prison for armed robbery, had a family with ties to the cartel, how mom testified against them and was now stuck in witness Protection. It destroyed my social life and made me really hate him. That is, until the real truth came out. I secretly made a fake Instagram account at the school library just to see what normal kids lives look like. While I was scrolling through photos of old friends and classmates, got a message from an account with no picture. Is your mom's name Angeline? My heart stopped. I almost deleted everything right there. But something made me respond. Who are you? I'm your dad. Prove it, I said confidently. When the stranger actually sent me evidence, I felt the entire room spin. According to Mom, Dad was in prison. But this person claiming to be Him managed to send photos I'd never seen before. Me as a baby in his arms. My birth certificate with a completely different last name. Private investigator reports showing he'd been searching for us for eight years. And not a single arrest record. I kept it a secret from mom. Came home acting normal, only to spend time at the library computers again the next day chatting with him. We started having weekly video calls, explaining things little by little. Your mom took you? The day I discovered she'd emptied my business accounts. Told me one afternoon $400,000 meant for employee payroll. She had a gambling problem I've been trying to help her with. When I found out about the theft and started calling the police, she picked you up from school and disappeared. Somehow I believed him. It made more sense than anything mom had been telling me for years. Why didn't you have her arrested? I asked. If I did, she said she'd take you down with her. And that scared me. Dad started tearing up on camera, but all I could think of was what now? One day after school, mom smiled and introduced me to a man with tattoos. This does the kid? He asked in a raspy voice. Yes. Say hi to your Uncle Tony. He's visiting all the way from Vegas. I stared at him, frozen. Something about the sharp suit, Cuban cigar and brass knuckles made my body too weak to say hello. Now go do your homework upstairs. Mom sent me away. I sat upstairs peeking at them from an angle on the stairs where they couldn't see me. I watched them set up cards, pour drinks, laughing. Angeline, I still can't believe you pulled off that 400,000 score from your husband. Tony said mom giggled. Easiest money I ever stole. He was too trusting. That was legendary. Cleaned out his whole construction business, then vanished with the kid. Brilliant. Well, I Learned from the best. Besides, I knew he couldn't do anything. Not if he wanted to.

My parents banned me from learning the local language because they said it would dilute my cultural purity. We moved here when I was 18 months old for dad's job, and 17 years later we were still here, living in an expat bubble where nobody had to interact with locals. My parents sent me to the International Academy, where everything was taught in our language by imported teachers who cost more than most locals made in five years. They genuinely believed learning the local language would erase my heritage and turn me into someone they couldn't recognize, pointing to other expat kids who'd gone native as cautionary tales. I lived in a country where I couldn't talk to 90% of the people. Every interaction outside our bubble required a translator or embarrassing hand gestures that made me look like an idiot tourist. I watched local kids my age hanging out in coffee shops and playing soccer in the park, but I couldn't join them because I literally couldn't communicate beyond pointing and smiling. My parents said this was good because local kids would be a bad influence, teaching me their backward ways and making me forget my superior education. They didn't understand that I had no connection to a homeland I couldn't even remember while being locked out of the only country I'd ever known. When I turned 14, I started secretly learning the language using a phone I bought with birthday Money and hid in my school locker. Every lunch break, I'd sit in the furthest bathroom stall with headphones, work, looking through language apps and watching local shows with subtitles. After two years, I was nearly fluent, but had to pretend I couldn't understand anything around my parents. The hardest part was stopping myself from reacting when people talked about us in public, assuming we couldn't understand their comments about rich foreigners who thought they were too good to integrate. Sometimes locals would say horrible things about my mom's clothes or my dad's attitude while we stood right there, and I had to keep my face complete, completely blank. My whole double life worked perfectly until that Saturday at the imported goods store my parents loved because all the staff spoke our language. We were shopping for Mom's birthday party when a man burst through the entrance waving something metallic that caught the fluorescent lights. He was shouting instructions that made everyone drop to the floor immediately except for us and two other foreign families who just stood there confused. A man's face was covered with a Bandana and his eyes were wild as he pointed his weapon at the cowering cashiers and kept yelling the same phrases over and over. My parents were complete frozen because they had no idea what was happening beyond the obvious threat. Dad actually started walking toward the exit, which made the man spin around and scream directly at him while jabbing the weapon. In his direction. Dad just kept walking because he didn't understand the man was telling him to get on the ground or he'd make an example out of him. And started counting down from five in the local language, his finger moving toward what was clearly a trigger. And my parents just stood there like confused tourists, waiting for someone to translate, get on the ground right now, because he's about to shoot dad! I screamed at my parents in our language while dropping to my knees. The shock on their faces wasn't from the death threat, but from hearing me translate perfectly. Mom's mouth fell open as I rapidly explained that the man wanted everyone's phones in a pile, women's jewelry in a bag, and nobody to look at his face.

You ever meet someone so arrogant that you just know they're gonna hurt themselves? Well, that's exactly what happened when I met this clueless woman at a dog park. I ended up watching her own dog bite her literal arm after she ignored my warnings. I've been a veterinarian for 12 years in Denver, Colorado. That morning, I taken my golden retriever, Max, to Cheeseman Park. The place was packed. Probably 40 dogs running around, kids on the playground nearby, and people doing yoga on the grass. Max was doing his usual thing. Sing every blade of grass like it held the secrets of the universe. That's when I noticed this Jack Russell terrier near the water fountain. Something was clearly off about him. The dog was stumbling slightly. Not the playful tumble of a happy dog, but that distinctive neurological wobble I'd seen too many times in my clinic. Then I saw the foam. Not just a normal dog drool, but thick white foam collecting at the corners of his mouth. The real tell was his eyes, dilated pupils, despite the bright morning sun and this vacant, unfocused stare. When another dog approached to play, the Jack Russell snapped at it. My stomach dropped. They were textbook rabies symptoms, and everyone at the park could potentially be in danger. The owner, this woman in designer workout clothes and pristine white sneakers, was simply scrolling through her phone, completely oblivious. I approached Her carefully keeping Max behind me. Excuse me, is that your Jack Russell? She looked up. Smile proudly. Yes, that's Winston. Isn't he precious? I kept my voice calm, professional. Ma'am, I'm a veterinarian and I'm concerned about your dog. He's showing symptoms that could indicate rabies. We need to get him contained and to an emergency vet immediately. Her face transformed instantly from proud mom to outraged defender. Excuse me, what did you say about my baby? Did you just call him dangerous? I tried again, pulling out my veterinary license from my wallet. Look, I'm a veterinarian. Your dog has neurological symptom, excessive salivation and aggression. When was his last rabies vaccination? She actually laughed. Oh, my god, you're one of those people. Winston is perfectly healthy. He's just excited to be at the park. The phone was getting worse, dripping onto the ground now. Ma'am, please, this is serious. Rabies is fatal. If she cut me off. Voice rising to a shriek that made everyone turn. Oh, please. You're just jealous because my dog is purebred and yours is just some mutt. I know your type. Bitter, judgmental women who can't stand seeing others happy. Now she was making a scene, waving her arms. This crazy woman is harassing me about my dog. She's probably not even a real vet. Other dog owners were starting to stare, some pulling their dogs closer. I showed my license to anyone who'd look. Please, someone help me convince her that Dog is sick. But he kept going louder now. Get away from us! You're ruining our morning. Winston is perfectly fine. Aren't you, baby? She bent down toward the dog, and I saw him tense up. That pre bite body language I knew too well. Don't touch him, I warned. She flip me off. Go away, you psycho! Find someone else to bother with your fake expertise. I walked away, but my years of experience wouldn't just let me leave. Instead, I sat on a bench about 30 feet away, where I could watch them while animal control on my cell. The dispatcher said they'd send someone, but it might take 20 minutes. I kept Max close, my eyes locked on Winston. The woman went back to her phone, occasionally baby talking to her dog, completely unaware he was now growling at shadows. I started recording on my phone, partly for evidence, partly because I knew what was coming. Other dogs instinctively gave Winston a wide birth. Animals know when something's wrong, even

The speed that you're traveling, by the time you actually hit the water, it will be the same as if you were hitting concrete. This is called surface tension. Purpose tension is the reason why Olympic swimming pools have little sprinklers shooting into the water. It rattles up the water a little bit, allowing the divers to enter the water like this instead of like this. And I don't know about you, but regardless of how much I know about surface tension, it still seems like if my parachute malfunctions, I should still aim for the water. But no. Surface tension. Science, blah blah blah. However, regardless of how annoying surface tension is, without it, our lives would be miserable. How so? Let me explain. Imagine you're walking through your apartment with a glass of water. You trip and fall and spill the glass of water on the floor, creating a puddle. Surface tension is the reason why the puddle of water is only this big and not this big covering every surface area of ground on your apartment floor. Literally without surface tension, if you spilled a glass of water on the floor, it would travel all over the floor about two microns deep. Meaning every time you spilled water, it would literally be impossible to clean all of it up.

I responded, bros before hoes, but moms before all. And everyone cracked up. Jason didn't smile, though. His face drained of color like I just confessed to murder. He grabbed all his stuff and moved 3 rows up the school bus without a word. Jason, what's wrong? I was just kidding. I called after him, but he wouldn't turn around. That's when I heard it stay. See, my girlfriend's best friend was crying her eyes out in the back row. When I turned to look, her friend whispered urgently in her ear and she glanced at me before crying harder. Okay, hey, that was definitely weird. I started to wonder whether my joke was really that offensive. That's when my phone buzzed. Three missed calls from dad, but there was no signal. And at the red light, I caught the bus driver wiping his eyes in the rearview mirror. In my three years of knowing him, the most emotion he'd shown was mild annoyance when kids left trash on the seats. A cold feeling crept into my stomach. I got up to go talk to Jason, but Missus Unfitzharris blocked the aisle. Sit down. We're moving. I just need to sit down. I'd never heard her voice like that. I sat. But the second we got to the destination, I cornered Jason. Dude, what is going On he backed away. Nothing. I just, I need space, bro. I was just kidding. I, I don't know if I'd pick my mom or my girlfriend. Why did you have to tell everyone what I said? Sid appeared out of nowhere and pulled me aside. Our team captain who never said more than pass the ball to me, grabbed my shoulders. Bro, if you need to talk about anything, I'm here. About what? I was almost shouting now. He just squeezed my shoulder and walked away. That cold feeling in my stomach was spreading. During the water break, Ryan shuffled over. This kid didn't even know my name. Yo. The blonde Kaylee from volleyball thinks you're cute. She's single now, too. The words hit like a punch. Dude, what the hell? I flashed him my lock screen. I have a girlfriend. His face went white. Just trying to help you move forward, man. Move forward. From what? I practically ran away. I tried calling my girlfriend Isabella on the public landline right then straight to voicemail. I must have called 15 times. I was losing my mind. Everyone felt so bad for me that no one even forced me back on the field to play. As soon as lunch hit, I grabbed Jason more aggressively this time. Tell me what's happening now. I can't. He was typing frantically in his notes app. You can't or you won't. His girlfriend Ava read over his shoulder then slapped him hard. How Could you not tell him, you coward? She stormed off. Jason, did something happen to Isabella? He wouldn't look at me, just kept typing. That's when Stacy walked by. She saw me and her face twisted with rage. You never deserved a girl like Usabella. I always told her she deserved better. Her friend clamped a hand over her mouth and dragged her away. My head was spinning. I stumbled to the vending machines where the coaches were arguing. He has a right to know now, Miss. As a Griffin hissed. There's no point. The decision has already been made. Mrs. Fitzharris shot back. Somebody tell me what's happening, I shouted. They scattered like roaches. It wasn't until the bus ride back that Jason spoke to me again. By that.

I discovered my wife was cheating when the kids mentioned Uncle Steve have been helping Mommy feel better at night. The betrayal hurt worse than anything I'd ever felt, but I knew staying would destroy me, so I filed for divorce. During the proceedings, I practically begged her to be reasonable about custody, look me in the eyes and said I would never keep your children from you. For six months, she actually kept her word and we fell into this decent routine where we'd exchange the kids every Friday without any drama. She'd even text me little updates about their school days and we managed to sit together at their soccer games like normal divorced parents. But then I pulled up for my regular Friday pickup and there was a for sale sign in the yard and the house was completely empty. I actually fell to my knees on their lawn because I knew she'd done it. She'd actually taken my kids. I called her phone over and over, but it just rang. When I gave up, I noticed the notification for a voicemail that came at 6:00am. Her voice was casual, saying we've relocated to Seattle for Steve's job and the kids are already enrolled in school. Like she was telling me about changing their soccer practice time. I sat in that driveway for an hour dissociating because she'd been planning on moving 3,000 miles away. For months while looking me in the eye every Friday, The next morning a process server handed me court papers claiming I was an absent father who prioritized work over my children. And I realized she'd also been documenting my business trips, kept calling and texting, begging to just hear my kids voices. It actually took 3 days for me to get through to her. She answered and instead of explaining anything, she offered monthly video calls like she was being generous. I accepted and she passed the phone to my 8 year old. He cried instantly. Why can't we see you this weekend? My ex immediately answered, daddy's too busy with work. Then hung up on me. My calls wouldn't go through after that and she texted that I had just used up my call for the month. I was so pissed and refused to let her get away with this. So the next week I liquidated my entire 4 o one k to pay a lawyer who told me I was fighting an uphill battle, but at least we could try. I quit my traveling job that I'd worked so hard for and the local position making 40% less. All this was to show the court I was prioritizing my children. Every other weekend I maxed out credit cards to fly to Seattle and my kids would run to me in the airport like I was returning from war. We spent weekends in cramped hotel rooms making blanket Forts and eating McDonald's because that's all I could afford. But they didn't care because we were together. Those weekends were perfect until Sunday drop offs when my ex would make sure to say things in front of me like, daddy doesn't live here. This is just vacation. Remember that your dad is Steve now. I just smile through it while documenting every text where she denied me extra time. After two years of never missing a single visit, the judge finally granted me a week each summer. And when my kids got older, they started asking why mom lied so much about me. I was glad they didn't fall for her lies, especially because she couldn't even acknowledge how hard she made all of this. But her karma came a year later. My phone rang at midnight and when I heard her crying, I almost hung up because I didn't want to deal with her drama.

I refused. And the next day before I left, I found them tearing up my lottery ticket, laughing because I'm envious. But I laughed my head off because that ticket was fake. See, I saw this coming from a mile away. My sister Ruby has always been the golden child and my parents have always made me give her everything. When I got my first job at 16, they made me give Ruby half my paycheck to teach me about sharing. When grandma left me her ring, they gave it to Ruby because she'll get more use out of it. Every birthday, every achievement, every moment of my life, Ruby had to get equal or more. So when I won, I knew they'd pull this exact stunt. The moment I told them, I could see the wheels turning in their heads. Dad immediately launched into his speech about family responsibility while Ruby sat there with that smug smile she gets when she's about to take something that's mine. That night, after they delivered their ultimatum, I heard them whispering in the kitchen, she'll cave, Ruby said confidently. She always does. Mom agreed, saying, I'd never actually leave because I'm too dependent on family. They had no idea they were dealing with someone who'd finally had enough. I spent all night creating a perfect day. Fake ticket. I Work in graphic design, so I knew exactly how to make it look authentic. Same paper, texture, same fonts, everything. The only difference, completely different numbers. That definitely hadn't won anything. I made sure it looked slightly worn, like I've been carrying it around since the drawing. Meanwhile, the real ticket was safely locked in my bank's safety deposit box, already verified and ready for claim. The next morning, I acted devastated. I came to breakfast looking like I've been crying all night. Fine, I said quietly. I'll pack and leave today. I made sure to accidentally leave the fake ticket in my wallet on the kitchen counter. When I went upstairs to pack, the bait was set. Sure enough, 20 minutes later, I heard screaming from downstairs. Amelia, get down here now. Dad's voice was shaking with rage. I walked down to find all three of them huddled around my wallet. The torn pieces of the fake ticket scattered across the counter like confetti. How does it feel now? Ruby laughed, holding up a piece of the the ticket. No lottery money for you. Maybe next time you'll think about what family means. Mom was nodding approvingly. This is what happens when you choose greed over family. Amelia, Dad crossed his arms. Hopefully this teaches you a lesson about sharing. I just stood there a moment, taking it all in. Then I started laughing, quietly at first, then louder. You're absolutely right, I said, still chuckling. That ticket was Completely worthless. Their triumphant expression started to alter. Something in my tone wasn't matching their expectations. I pulled out my phone and opened my banking app, making sure the screen was facing them. 1, 847 30, 329, 18, deposited yesterday at three forty seven PM the silence that followed was deafening. Ruby's mouth literally fell open. Mom grabbed the counter to study herself. Dad just stared at my phone screen like it was showing him a ghost. The real ticket was never in my wallet, I continued calmly. It's been in my bank safety deposit box since the day after I won. That piece of garbage you just tore up, I made it last night specifically for you to find. Ruby's face went from pale to bright red. You, you tricked us. You tricked yourselves. I replied. I just gave you enough rope to hang yourselves with. And boy, did you ever. Amelia, wait, mom started her voice suddenly much. We can work this out. We were just trying to teach you. Teach me what? I interrupted that my own family would destroy what they thought was my future out of spite. Message received loud and clear. Dad tried his authoritative voice. Now hold on just a minute. We're still your parents and, and you just prove that means absolutely nothing to you when money is involved. Ruby was getting desperate. Now, Amelia, come on. We're family. Families fight, but they work things out, right? I mean, we can share The money now, can't we? 50 50, just like we originally talked about. I grabbed my keys from the counter. You're right, Ruby. That ticket you destroyed was worthless, just like this family apparently is. As I I headed for the door, I heard Ruby screaming behind me. You can't just leave. We're your family. You owe us, Amelia. But I was already in my car, driving away to my new life, a life where I'd never again have to pretend that blood relation means more than basic human decency. Ruby's still calling and texting every day, begging for another chance, and I don't answer. Some lessons are permanent. The best part, I'm happier now than I've ever been. Turns out, when you remove toxic people from your life, even winning the lottery feels like the smaller victory.

I was lucky enough to have my daughter in my class when she got to ninth grade, but also had another kid who would constantly bug her. He was always trying to flirt with the girls in my class, which ended with them slapping him on numerous different occasions. I sent him to the office so many times that he had to sit in the front, but one day he practically begged me to sit in the back. I don't know why, but I said yes. We were in the middle of an assignment, and our entire class was silent when at one point, I could hear whispering coming from the back. I looked up, and all I saw was him showing another student what, at first glance, looked like a handgun. It honestly took me a second to process what I had just seen. I didn't have a clear enough view to be sure, and I just sat there trying to stay calm. I knew I had to get a better look, so I stood up to go help one of my students. Now I was sure it wasn't a toy. It was real. I remember my sweat literally dripping off my face and tried my hardest not to pass out. My hands were shaking like crazy while I dialed 9 1 1 on my phone, but it was too quiet to say Anything. Couldn't just walk out of the room. I had to keep my students safe and knew I had to get my daughter out of there. I texted our assistant principal in all caps exactly what I had just seen, and waited minutes for a response. Eventually, I knew I couldn't wait, so I called that same girl over to my desk. I wrote her a note that said, ask me to use the bathroom. Go get the assistant principal, get him to check his phone and leave. The school immediately tried to keep a calm look on my face, but she could see something was horribly wrong. She left without saying anything, and I tried to act like everything was normal. Five excruciating minutes later, he knocked on the door. He walked inside and started chatting with a few students, acting as if nothing was wrong. I think they started to catch on something was going on, too, and eventually, he asked the boy to come out into the hall with him. He stood up, and those few seconds as he walked by my daughter to the door were the most terrifying of my life. As soon as he stepped out, he was tackled to the ground. Apparently, he was planning to use it on another student that lunch. And since then, I homeschool my daughter.

So my sister has been having kids since she was basically a teenager. She got pregnant at 18, married her boyfriend because both sets of parents pushed it. And now at 29, she's got five kids, 11, 6, 3, 2 and 1. And now she's pregnant again. Close with our parents, so we have family dinners a lot. And every single time she starts in on the same routine, how her life sucks, how her body is ruined, how she can't get surgery, how she never has money, never gets time for herself, how no one will watch her kids. It's constant. Her husband works all the time and can't stand her, so she just dumps it all on us. And honestly, her kids are wild. Sitting through those dinners feels like surviving a war zone. What pisses me off is that none of this was forced on her. Our parents gave us the talk at 16, gave us birth control, told us to focus on school and careers before starting families. She wanted a baby at 18. She kept choosing to have kid after kid. She had options. She ignored all of them. So Christmas rolls around and sure enough, she's sitting there with her pity party going on and on about how I don't understand because I've got a degree, a good job, a boyfriend, no kids, can afford to go to the gym. I get to live life. While she's trapped and I just snapped. I told her to shut the fuck up. I told her she's in this mess because she's a moron who made terrible choices and nobody feels sorry for her. My brother started laughing. My parents stayed quiet, which says a lot because behind her back, they complain about her all the time too. And she lost it. Now she's crying on Facebook, making sad TikToks about how society hates mothers and where's her village? And even my family doesn't care about me. But the truth is she built this life herself and I'm done.

She returned 6 years later to find I'd divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years, Max. Don't change the locks. He left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation. To our eight year olds, that first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home, and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decisions. No more walking on eggshells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curveball in our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year two brought unexpected changes. Without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I'd been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd forgotten how To enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually, she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her bonus mom. Their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes, and tucked them in at night. Year five was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and. And being the mom who stayed, there wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year six, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward. After Three years of zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from the living room. Through the window, we watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she owned the place.

Some bridges need burning. My sister demanded I sleep with her husband to give them a baby because she was infertile. Rachel had always been the golden child, who once faked a cancer scare to steal attention at my wedding and later sued her bridesmaid for getting pregnant before her big day. She got dad's business connections and mom's jewellery collection while I scraped by with community college loans, then married rich and spent her days posting filtered photos or telling my seven year old daughter she was too fat for dance class. When I miscarried last year, she posted about it on Facebook before I could tell anyone, adding prayer hands, emojis and everything happens for reason while collecting sympathy likes. But now, after five years of her trying to conceive a baby, family suddenly meant everything to her. Her obsession with natural conception had cost them hundreds of thousands of dollars on fertility crystals and moon ceremonies. She refused IVF, calling it artificial poison, and wouldn't consider adoption because she needed to know her child's genetics. During Sunday dinner, she stared at my kids with tears streaming down her face, gripping her husband's hand until her knuckles turned white. That's when mom leaned over and whispered, you know, you have such beautiful children, and you and Rachel share the same DNA. And then two weeks later, the spa day invitation. That should have been my first warning, but I thought maybe she wanted To reconnect. Instead, I walked into her living room to find mom already there, both of them wearing matching silk robes and expectant. We have the perfect solution, Rachel announced, gesturing for me to sit between them. You're going to sleep with Dave and give us a baby naturally, the way nature intended. She said it like she was asking to borrow a cup of sugar, while mom nodded along like this was discussing vacation plan. I couldn't believe I was actually considering it. And Rachel didn't spare a second in sending me ovulation tracking apps and insisting I take fertility tests at her private clinic. She wore me down with daily phone calls and surprise visits, always with mom as backup. But then I found myself sitting in her marble bathroom letting her inject me with hormones. She had me taking supplements that made my skin crawl and my emotions swing wildly. My husband slammed doors and accused me of being insane for even considering it. I moved to his parents house. Well, I just kept hoping she come to her senses. Everything changed the day I was holding laundry and heard her on the phone with her best friend laughing about something. Dave asked for an open marriage last year, she said. My hands froze on a tiny pink shirt. This kills two birds. He gets his variety.

Three years ago, my coworker and I got married in Vegas for a work visa. The plan was brilliant. I needed to stay in the country. He needed my health insurance for his daughter's surgery. Quick courthouse wedding, two years of fooling immigration, then a quiet divorce. We high fived after signing the papers like we just pulled off a heist. We had. The first year was pure performance art. We memorized each other's birthdays, allergies, childhood pets. I Learned he takes his coffee with three sugars. He Learned I sleep on the left side. Immigration interviewed us twice. We passed by knowing things real couples probably didn't. We'd studied each other like a test. His daughter Emma called me daddy's friend even though I was at every soccer game. We had rules. No dating others for two years. Too risky. Separate bedrooms when no one was watching. Joint bank account for show. Separate finances for real. We wore our rings to work and family events. Took them off at home. Mine lived on my keychain, his in his gym bag.

Emma started calling me by my name instead of daddy's friend. When she got sick. I drove them to the E R. At 3 a m. Without him asking. Stayed for seven hours. That Wasn't for immigration. We joke about our divorce party we throw in. Six months, made a Pinterest Board of freedom cakes. His mom kept asking when we'd give her grandchildren.

Daddy? My teenage daughter started getting mysterious phone calls every afternoon. And I thought it was just normal teenager stuff. But then I noticed the pattern. Every day at 3:30 p m, her phone would ring with an unknown number. She'd immediately stop whatever she was doing and answer. On the first ring, her whole demeanor would change instantly. Voice dropping to a whisper, shoulders hunching forward, quickly walking to her room. When I. I asked who was calling, she'd just say, nobody important and close her door. Her behaviour started changing in other ways, too. She stopped hanging out after school. No more drama club meetings. No more study groups at the library. She'd rush home every single day, anxiously checking her phone every few minutes until that call came through. My husband thought I was being paranoid. She's 15. Girls have secrets. This is completely normal behaviour. But my mom instincts were screaming that something was seriously wrong. I started paying closer attention to these calls. She'd be on them for hours. Sometimes I could hear her through the door, speaking so quietly I couldn't make out words. But the tone was strange. Gentle, patient. Almost like she was comforting someone. No giggling like when she talked to friends. No complaining like when she talked to us. Just this soft, careful voice I'd never heard her use before. One afternoon, I was folding laundry outside her room when I heard her say something that made me freeze. I love you too, dad. See you tomorrow. Same time. My blood ran cold instantly. Her father was literally downstairs watching TV. Who was she calling? Dad? I knocked on her door immediately. She opened it, phone already hidden behind her back. Her face was red, eyes puffy, like she been crying. Everything okay, sweetie? I asked, trying to keep my voice casual. Fine, mom. Just talking to a friend about homework. But I saw her call log notification still glowing on her smartwatch. 2 hours and 43 minutes. What? Homework discussion lasted almost

I picked up my daughter Zoe from school Tuesday afternoon, and when I leaned over to kiss her forehead like I always did, she jerked away. Don't, dad. Miss Novak taught us that when you get kissed, the person's DNA stays inside you for seven years, like you're infected. She said, we're collecting other people's gross stuff and can't ever get it out. Her eyes welled up. Mom kissed me goodbye this morning. Does that mean I have her gross DNA stuck in me now? My hands tightened on the steering wheel. I teach AP biology at the high school across town. And not only was this scientifically false, it was psychologically damaging. That evening, I sent Miss Novak a polite email explaining that I was Zoe's father and a biology teacher, and that DNA from saliva breaks down within hours, not years. Her reply came quickly. Mr. Coleman, it was a simple lesson on DNA and germs. You know, how kids can traumatize things. Wouldn't worry about it. I tried to brush it off, figuring maybe she just misspoken or Zoe had misunderstood. But then Wednesday morning, Zoe refused breakfast, and when I asked why, she pushed her bowl away and said, yesterday Miss Novak was crying in class. She kept talking about this guy she used to date, like, three years ago. She said she can still feel his gross DNA inside her from when They kissed him and she called him a walking contamination or something. I nearly choked on my coffee. She's discussing her ex boyfriend with 12 year olds. Zoe nodded miserably. She was actually crying, dad. She said guys like Brad just want to infect girls with their DNA and then leave them. It was really weird. By Thursday, the parent group chat explode. Multiple children had come home terrified of physical contact. One mother wrote that her daughter wouldn't hug her uncle anymore because Miss Novak said men spread more DNA than women. Another parent said their son was dehydrated because he refused to use the water fountain after Miss Novak said drinking from it was basically like kissing everyone who used it before you, collecting years of their DNA in your mouth. First thing Friday morning, I met with Prince Vazquez alongside three other concerned parents. We presented our concerns about Miss Novak, discussing her personal dating life and teaching false science. The principal reviewed her file and found two previous complaints.

I tried to be considerate, I really did. I'd set my alarm 10 minutes earlier so I could be done before she woke up. I kept my shampoo and stuff in a basket so everything was clean and organized and she wanted to use it. And still she complained. Gwen told our parents I was hogging the bathroom every morning, even though I showered an hour before she woke up. She complained that the steam from my hot showers made the bathroom more moldy and toxic and gave her asthma. But it was summer, so I only took cold showers. Mom scolded me, telling Me to be more considerate of my sister. But that only made her lies older. She started setting her alarm for 6:00am just to me in the bathroom. Then she'd tell our parents I woke her up. So mom scolded me again, texting, be quieter next time. Your sister needs sleep. The lie that really got me into trouble was when Gwen claimed she lost her dream job at a marketing firm because I hogged the bathroom that morning. I finished my shower when I heard her phone blaring job interview today over and over. But Gwen was dead asleep. Now, I could have let her miss it, you know, especially after everything she done.

Your father and I discussed it, and we've decided you can use the garage. We'll get you a space heater for winter. I actually laughed out loud. The garage? Are you completely insane? Don't be dramatic, Lucas. Lots of college kids would love a free place to stay. You should be grateful. Free place? To stay? That's rich, coming from someone who hasn't paid a dime toward anything. That's when inspiration hit me. I pulled out my phone and scrolled to my landlord's number. What are you doing? Nicole asked nervously. I hit dial and put it on speaker. Hi, Mrs. Davis, it's Lucas.

This scrawny kid named Georgie slipped a hundred dollar Bill into my hand during lunch and told me it was mine if I beat up Carson Block. I almost spit out my chocolate milk. Carson was the biggest eighth grader anyone had ever seen. He looked like he spent time in prison and was pitching, not catching G, if you know what I mean. The kid was six feet tall with arms thicker than my legs. Meanwhile, Georgie was maybe 90 pounds, soaking wet, with these skinny arms that look like twigs. His left arm was in a homemade sling made from an old T-shirt. I stared at the money, thinking this had to be some kind of joke. Nobody in their right mind would pay someone to fight Carson. The kid had put three seventh graders in the nurse's office just this month. I'm pretty sure the security guards were scared of him. But Georgie's eyes were dead serious and kind of desperate. Why me? I asked. Because you're the only one who stands a chance. You knocked out that ninth grader last year who was messing with your sister. That was different, though. That kid had been picking on my little sister for weeks. This felt random and weird. Plus, a hundred bucks was more money than I'd ever seen a middle schooler carry around. Georgie must have noticed my confusion because he leaned in closer. Please, I've been saving up for months. Nobody else will do it. Something about the way he said it made me pause. This wasn't about showing off or some stupid dare. Georgie looks scared but determined. I pocketed the money and told him to meet me after school to explain what was really going on. We sat on the bleachers by the empty football field. Georgie kept glancing around like he was worried someone would see us talking. Up close, I could see bruises on his neck that looked a few days old. His homemade sling was because he couldn't afford a real doctor. Carson and his dad moved in with us two months ago.

I hadn't talked to mom in, like, two weeks because work had been crazy. The guilt hit me like a truck. What happened? Is she okay? I asked, already reaching for my laptop to check my bank account. Heart problems, Kevin said. The doctor say it's serious and they need $2,000 today or they're transferring her to some crappy public hospital. I already spent everything I had on the ambulance ride. I felt like the worst son ever. While I was sitting there watching stupid shows, mom was suffering and I didn't even know. Kevin kept talking about how scared he was and how mom didn't want to worry me because she knew I was stressed with my new job. Send me your Venmo, I said. I didn't even think twice. I transferred $2,000 that was supposed to be for my car. Payment. Kevin was so grateful, thanking me over and over. He promised he'd pay me back as soon as insurance kicked in. I felt better knowing I'd helped, but the guilt was still eating at me. Three days later, I drove to Mom's house with flowers and soup. I figured she'd be resting at home by now. When I knocked, mom answered the door, looking perfectly fine, like she was wearing her garden

I admit it. I messed up. I had forgotten my phone was on silent, and so for two hours straight, I sweated my butt off on Smash Bros. At my friend's house and forgot to text my girlfriend Cindy back. So when I finally saw her, 15 missed calls, she was furious. I need to know you're actually where you say you are, she said. But I already sent you my location and a picture of us on the coach. It's not enough. What if there are girls hiding behind you on the couch? Or what if it's just an old picture? I'm not stupid. From now on, when you're out, we video call so I can see. Or you can wake up single the next day. She hung up, practically foaming at the mouth. The first few calls were painfully awkward. I'd have to go around the house, introduce each of my friends to her, basically give her a house tour to show it's all clear before she hang up. And randomly call again in the next hour or so to make sure I didn't change locations or invited over girls to my friend's house. After a few days like this, everyone was going crazy over her rule. My friend Jeff pulled me to the side with a concerned look. Dude, honestly, if she's gonna act crazy, you gotta do it, too. That's when it came to me. A brilliant idea. The next time I was at Jeff's house, I answered Cindy's call in my best David Attenborough voice. Here we observe the male human in his natural habitat. Approaching the buffalo wings with caution, I slowly turned the camera towards my friends, who immediately caught on and started acting like wildlife. In the background, dinner was pretending to be a gazelle and Jeff was chest beating like a gorilla. Very funny, Cindy said, rolling her eyes at us. The next Friday, we took it further. I answered the call holding a microphone, reading out a fake weather forecast, while Jeff held up a map glued to a pizza box. Currently, we're experiencing a high pressure system of Mario Kart moving through the living room area, I announced. Temperatures are rising as we travel through Rainbow Road. Now back to you, Cindy. Stop being weird.

We adopted Jalen when he was 8. His birth mom was my younger sister who overdosed when he was 6, and his dad was nowhere to be found. I was 32 at the time with no kids of my own, and my husband Mike was completely on board. We figured we'd give Jalen the stable home he deserved after bouncing between foster homes for two years. Ellen was this quiet, serious kid who'd seen way too much for his age. He'd flinch whenever we raised our voices, even if we were just calling him for dinner from the other room. It took months before he'd laugh at my terrible dad jokes or let us hug him without going stiff. But slowly, he started opening up. He'd help Mike in the garage on weekends, asked me to pack extra snacks for school, started calling us mom and dad around his 10th birthday. For years, everything was perfect. Helen made good grades, played baseball in middle school, had friends over for sleepovers. We never hid his adoption from him, but he seemed completely settled with us. When he turned 16, I taught him to drive in our old Honda Civic. Mike took him fishing every summer. We were a real family. But then his senior year, something changed. Jalen started asking more questions about his birth family. Where they lived, if he had any siblings, what happened to his dad, I tried to be honest but gentle, telling him what little I knew. His birth mom had struggled with addiction, bounced around a lot, made poor choices. His dad had left when Jalen was 3 and never came back. One day in February, Jalen came home from school acting weird. He kept checking his phone during dinner and barely touched his food. When I asked what was wrong, he said some guy named Carlos had messaged him on Instagram, claiming to be his older half brother. My stomach dropped. I knew Carlos existed, but had hoped he'd never surface. Carlos was 19, lived about three hours away, and according to Jalen

Look, in my defense, I heard the words free pizza and my brain immediately shut off every survival instinct. I had no thoughts, no hesitation, just a hungry idiot following the scent of melted cheese like a cartoon character floating toward a high on a window sill. It started with a block party flyer stuck to my door. Come meet your neighbors! Free pizza, breadsticks, and drinks! I just moved in, didn't know anyone, and I figured, hey, this is how normal people make friends. So Saturday rolls around and I show up at the Big House at the end of the hold the sack expecting, like, a chill barbecue vibe. You know, paper plates, kids running around, someone's dog begging for scraps. Instead, I walk in and immediately notice two things. Everyone is dressed in matching maroon robes. There's a massive golden breadstick mounted on the wall like the freaking holy Grail. Now, a normal, functioning adult would see this and leave. But not me. Nope. I see a tower of pizza boxes on the kitchen island and think maybe it's just one of those quirky HOA things. So I grab a slice, sit down, and start eating. That's when papa Tony shows up. Big guy, beard that looks like he glued bread crumbs to his face, robe with fancier embroidery than the others. That's a hand on my shoulder and goes, welcome, Brother Crust. Tonight you join Us in honoring the Holy Dough. At this point, you'd think I'd panic, but all I could think was, Brother Crust, that's kind of badass. Before I know it, they're handing me a robe. I try to say no, but someone's already tying it around my neck like a super hero Cape. Papatoni leads us all into the living room, which, by the way, had been cleared of furniture except for an altar covered in marinara candles, and starts chanting, in yeast we trust, in carbs we are bound.

We had a basement dog named biscuit. That's what mom called him. Never allowed upstairs, never went outside, never saw the vet. Just lived in our basement in Denver for 8 years. Some dogs are indoor dogs, she'd say when I asked why biscuit couldn't come to the park. He's shy. The rules about biscuit were non negotiable. Only mom feeds him. Never go downstairs after 9 p m. Don't tell friends about our special dog. If he makes noise during dinner parties, turn the TV louder. I was 12 when I started questioning things. What kind of dog barks in perfect English words sometimes? Why did his howls sound like help, please? Must be my imagination. Dad said dogs make weird sounds. My little sister Amy loved biscuit. Would sneak him cookies through the basement door slot. One day, she dropped her doll down there. There. And cried until mom let her retrieve it. She came back confused. Biscuit has hands, she whispered to me. He gave me my doll with hands, mom heard. Amy spent the weekend at Grandma's for lying. When she came back, she never mentioned Biscuit's hands again. I started paying attention. Biscuits food bowls were always plastic plates and cups, never dog bowls. His kibble looked suspiciously like cereal. His water bowl had a straw in it. Sometimes the basement door had seven locks, seven from the outside. One night, I heard biscuit howling. Again. But this time, I pressed my ear to the floor. It wasn't howling. It was crying. Sobbing. Human sobbing. I snuck Dad's keys while he slept. Crept to the basement door at three a

I was at one of those chaotic indoor play places for my son Leo's seventh birthday party. He'd spent the entire hour at the ticket spewing Jackpot game, his face a mask of pure concentration. Finally, he hit the grand prize. A river of 1,000 tickets poured out of the machine. He was ecstatic, clutching the massive paper snake to his chest like a holy relic. That's when I saw him. A little boy, maybe five years old, pointed at Leo's tickets. I want that one. His father, a guy in an expensive tracksuit who'd been on his phone the whole time, came over. He didn't look at me, only at the tickets. Hey, my son wants those, let him have them. I was genuinely stunned. I'm sorry, what? My son just won these. The dad let out a long breath like I was a massive inconvenience. Look, he's having a meltdown. Just give him the tickets. The kids birthday party. They need to learn to share, right? I stared at him. No, he saved his tokens. All party to win this. He's not giving it away. He raised his voice loud enough for the other parents at our party table to hear. Are you serious? You're going to let your kid be selfish over a bunch of worthless paper? What kind of values are you teaching him? I could feel the blood in my cheeks. Kind Of values where you don't hand over your things just because someone throws a tantrum. Now he was practically yelling, my son is having a bad day. You're raising a spoiled brat who doesn't care about other people's feelings. His son was still screaming. And now other families were starting to stare at the scene he was creating. Leo had been watching the whole thing. He looked from the screaming boy to the angry father, then down at his precious roll of tickets. The father saw his chance and knelt down, his voice sickly sweet. Hey, little man.

On championship night, I was 5 feet 6 inches and 145 pounds as a high school freshman. The size of a decent seventh grader. My dad's jeans had cursed me with a body better suited for cross country than contact sports. But I didn't wanna run in circles. I wanted to play football. Coach Morris looked at me like I was roadkill when I showed up for tryouts. 30 seconds into my first drills, I heard it. Wilson, what are you doing here? The chess club meets in the library. The team erupted in laughter. Kept my mouth shut. Finish the drill. You're gonna get yourself killed out here, kid. Coach said afterward, why don't you try something else? Maybe track? I looked him straight in the eye. I wanna play. He sighed. Fine. You can be equipment manager, help with practice. Maybe in a few years, if you grow. So that's what I did. I washed jerseys, fixed helmets, set up cones and filled water bottles while the actual players got to play. After everyone left, I'd run the same drills they did. I set up tackling dummies and hit them until my shoulders ache. I studied playbooks like they were sacred tech. Junior year, I grown two inches and added 20 pounds of muscle. Still small, but solid. I tried out again. This time I didn't just run drills. I demolished them. My 40 yard dash was second fastest on the team. My route running was precise. My hands never dropped a pass. Not bad, coach admitted. But this isn't a practice drill. This is varsity football. Those guys across town would snap you like a twig. He put me on special teams. The Suicide Squad. Just bodies to throw at kick returns. First game of the season, I flew down the field on kickoff, weaving through blockers twice my size, and made a tackle that echoed through the stadium. The crowd erupted. Coach ignored it, called it lucky. Then I did it again the next game. And the next. By mid season, I forced two fumbles on kick returns. Fans started chanting will, son! Will, son! Whenever kickoff came. Except for Brandon Reeves, our star quarterback and the coach's godson. 6 foot 3, college scouts at every game. Arrogance as big as his arm. He made it his mission to.

Then my brother discovered the family gold mine. Midnight texts became routine. Emergency babysitting needed. The twins, regular sitter canceled. Of course, the emergency was always tickets to concerts, bar crawls, or weekend getaways with his girlfriend. I Learned to sleep with my phone on silent.

I watched her look at me across that candlelit table and say she couldn't compete with my family's chaos anymore. After graduation, things got worse. My parents, claiming they wanted to help me settle in, secretly made copies of My apartment keys and distributed them to my siblings like VIP passes. I dragged myself home from my marketing job exhausted from client presentations, only to find my living room transformed into a daycare center, toys scattered everywhere, juice boxes leaking on my white couch, and kids I hadn't even agreed to watch. My boss pulled me aside after I missed my third important presentation.

Her mother showed up with a printed invoice demanding 90 thousand dollars for emotional damages and loss of future earnings as a married woman. When I said we were done, she went nuclear swinging her purse at me while I recorded. Again, Bianca tried using my memorized credit card information for a three thousand dollar purchase to her parents house. The fraud department caught it. She showed up at my workplace claiming a family emergency, then made another scene when security escorted her out. That night she posted Instagram photos doing shots with the caption single and ready to mingle. X was abusive. During court proceedings, she arrived in a white dress with a fake arm sling and wheelchair. The judge reviewed all evidence, a video, security footage, witness statements, fraud attempts. When given a chance to speak, she said he ruined my life. He's always been controlling with money. He made me sign prenups and everything. You weren't married? The judge noted there was no prenup. Well, he would have made me sign one. That shows what kind of person he is. The judge looked exhausted. Miss, you're charged with false reporting an assault, not theoretical future prenups. Guilty on both charges. 200 hours community service, anger management classes, 5,000 dollar fine, 2 year restraining order, 1 year probation. She violated the restraining order by hiring her cousin Anthony to vandalize my car with baseball bats. Security cameras caught them, leading to her Second arrest for conspiracy. Final court appearance 120 days in jail, three years probation, $15,000 in fine. Five year restraining order. Her mother lost her job and marriage. Anthony got 18 months in prison.

Second store, wedding shoes for $400. Then we hit a high end boutique where things went sideways. She started grabbing regular dresses, bags, jewelry. Not wedding items, just expensive stuff. When I pulled Bianca aside, she said, for the honeymoon, obviously. You already bought honeymoon outfits last month. Those were for the pre honeymoon trip with my girl. We never discussed that. We're stretched with wedding costs. God, why are you being so cheap? It's just money. The sales lady announced the total, $8,600. Absolutely not, I said. That's insane. Bianca's face went red, then purple. She grabbed her phone and screamed, I'm calling the police! You hit me! Help! He's attacking me! The store went silent. Every customer turned to stare. My brother's a paralegal. And drilled into me, always document everything. While Bianca made her scene, I calmly pulled out my phone, started recording, and held it openly. Please do call them, I said. I'm recording everything for our safety. When she saw the phone, she doubled down and started hitting herself in the arm, actually hitting herself while screaming, stop! Please stop hitting me! I kept recording, didn't move, didn't speak. Stood there holding my phone. The time stamp would show I hadn't moved in two minutes. Two security guards arrived, saw her hitting herself while I stood five feet away recording. And one said, ma'am, please stop hitting yourself. The police arrived 12 minutes later. I showed them my video. Eight minutes. Of footage showing me standing still while she screamed, hit herself, and threw a shoe at me. They reviewed the boutique's security footage, which showed the exact moment I said no, her face changing and her starting the performance. At no point was I within arms reach until she threw the shoe.

The custody battle was getting ugly. I was 14, splitting time between their apartments, and everything felt broken. Then my phone buzzed again. Call me now. Mom's voice was desperate when I answered. Did you see my text? Yeah. What the hell are you asking me to do? Your father is winning. His lawyer destroyed me in court today. I need evidence that you're not safe with him. My chest tightened. Mom, you want me to fake suicide notes? Not a suicide note. A journal entry. The therapist appointment is tomorrow. Doctor Rossi needs to see that you have these thoughts at his place. Her voice got urgent. Right. That you stare at his sleeping pills count and you think about taking them when he's asleep. Mom, stop. Listen to me. If I don't get full custody, your father loses his health insurance through my job. You know he needs insulin. It's $800 a month without coverage. She paused. He's already rationing. You've seen it. You can't use his diabetes against me. I'm using it for him. If you write this, I get custody, and I'll keep him on my insurance for the whole year. Even after the divorce. I sat on my bed feeling sick. Dad had been rationing his insulin. I'd seen him skip doses, checking his blood sugar, obsessively trying to stretch his supplies. Last week, his hands were shaking so bad he couldn't open a water. Water bottle. I can't write that I want to die. You're not actually suicidal. It's just words on paper. Write that being at his apartment makes you feel hopeless. That you think about ending it. That you wonder if anyone would care. She was crying now. Please, his help. The next morning, she showed up at Dad's apartment while he was at work. She handed me a notebook and a folded paper. Copy this in your handwriting. I opened her notes. The words made me nauseous. I think about ending it. I wonder if anyone would care. When I'm at his apartment, I imagine taking all 47 of his pills. He wouldn't find me until morning. Mom, this is insane. This is necessary.

The landlord started laughing. My roommate's boyfriend, Wesley, had been planning this moment for months, ever since he started staying over back in June. He'd been telling his boys about how he was finessing his way into a free apartment. He even started forwarding his mail here to establish what he called residency rights. The relationship wasn't even official before Wesley started making his move. He'd walk around my apartment, well, what he thought was going to be his apartment, measuring room and telling his cousin which wall would be perfect for his TV setup. Melanie's been carrying this dead weight for too long, he'd mutter while eating my groceries. Time for her to learn she doesn't need a roommate anymore. So there I was, standing in my own living room on a Thursday night. The whole place smelled like the Cologne Wesley bathed in. Wesley showed up with his cousin Mitchell and two duffel bags, already acting like he owned the place, both of them looking like they were ready to physically move me out if needed. Melanie, I hope you found somewhere else to stay, Wesley said, dropping his bags by the door. This is happening tonight. You've been taking advantage of my girl's kindness for long enough. I stayed quiet, scrolling through my phone, let him have his moment. Melanie sat on the couch, avoiding eye contact with everyone. Wesley had been working on her for weeks. Convincing her that I was holding her back, that they needed their privacy, that couples shouldn't have roommates. She'd started parroting his words recently. Maybe it's time for a change. Maybe we've outgrown this arrangement. Classic Wesley manipulation. The man didn't even have his own place. He'd been couch surfing before he latched onto Melanie. Wesley pulled out a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket. I printed out this 30 day notice. But honestly, you should just go tonight. Make this easy on everyone. Mitchell nodded like this was all perfectly legal. Smart move, Wesley. She's had a free ride.

My sister burst into my room and blocked the door, screaming, please just take Angie to prom. She's been crying about going alone. I stared at her from my desk chair and said, this has disaster written all over it. Three weeks before prom, my sister sat on my bed and launched into her pitch. Angie's been rejected by four different guys. She won't eat lunch anymore, just hides in the library. She pulled up Angie's Instagram, showing months of deleted photos. She's been my best friend since fifth grade, and now she's talking about not even going to prom. Would it kill you to ask her? The guilt was working. Angie had practically lived at our house growing up, always laughing at my dumb jokes, always bringing homemade cookies. She needs one good night before graduation. I felt my stomach not up, but agreed to try. Finding her alone in the library was easy. I walked over nervously and cleared my throat. Hey, Angie, would you maybe want to go to prom with me? She looked up, shocked, her book dropping, are you serious? When I nodded, she whispered, yes, eyes bright with disbelief. The week before prom, we went corsage shopping together at the local florist. Angie kept touching every flower nervously. I don't know anything about corsages. Is white too boring? I picked up a bright orange one and held it against her Wrist. How about traffic cone orange? She laughed and pushed my hand away. That's hideous. We spent 20 minutes making increasingly ridiculous suggestions until the florist looked ready to kick us out. Angie finally chose a simple white rose with baby his breath. So pretty, I said, looking at her. Prom night came too fast. At her house, her mom positioned us for photos by the staircase. Her dad joined her mom with his professional camera. Turn your head slightly left. No, your other left, Angie muttered. There's only one left, dad. I tried not to laugh, but failed. Start over. You're both laughing, her mom scolded. We took approximately 700 photos. Angie's face hurt from fake smiling. I looked arranged in all of these, she said, scrolling through them. Her little brother photo bombed the last few, making bunny ears behind us. At least those are honest, Angie said. In the

Don't let anyone take her. I okay. I stood there frozen while she vanished into the airport crowd without looking back. The baby was maybe 8 months old, wearing a yellow onesie with ducks on it, and he gripped my shirt with her tiny fist like we've done this before. Other passengers started staring immediately. An older couple whispered to each other while a businessman looked up from his laptop. The baby smelled like vanilla lotion and stayed weirdly calm, just watching me with huge brown eyes. Thirty seconds had passed, but it already felt like an hour. What kind of mother just hands her baby to a complete stranger? Five minutes in and the baby started that pre cry whimpering. That meant I had maybe 30 seconds before full meltdown. I tried bouncing her while making shushing sounds, but nothing worked. People were really staring now, some moving away from us like we had something contain ages. An older woman wearing a World's Best Grandma sweatshirt came over and said, honey, did she just leave you with her baby? I explained she said she'd be right back, but grandma shook her head with this knowing look. Maybe she abandoned it. People do crazy things at airports. You should find security. The baby chose that moment to go full Siren mode with that piercing cry that makes everyone in A 50, but radius wins. I walked in circles trying to calm her, but she just screamed louder. My arms were already getting sore. Where the hell was this woman? The grandmother suggested maybe I should take the baby to the information desk, but something about the mother's desperation made me stay put. At the 10 minute Mark, I noticed a man in a navy suit standing by the windows, pretending to look at planes, but watching us in the reflection.

My dad died last March after battling cancer for two years. The whole thing was brutal, watching him slowly waste away. My mom became a shell of herself during those final months. We all pulled together as a family except for my brother Chet. He had been the black sheep for years before dad got sick. Chet had stolen money from dad and dropped out of college three times. He refused to get a job or take any responsibility for his life. Dad finally cut him off financially last year after Chet stole $30,000. He took the money straight from their retirement account without asking anyone. When dad passed away, Chet showed up at the funeral home acting devastated. He even volunteered to handle the gravestone paperwork to help mom out. We were all shocked, but thought maybe losing dad had changed him. Mom was barely functioning, so we let Chet handle the Monument arrangements. We had already picked out the inscription. Together as a family. Family. It would say. Beloved father and husband forever in our hearts. The words were simple and classic. Exactly what dad would have wanted. The funeral came and went without any major incidence. Chet gave a speech about redemption and family that made everyone cry. For three weeks after the funeral, we thought he'd finally grown up. Mom even started talking about reconciling with him. She kept saying, dad would have wanted the Family to stay together. Then the day of the gravestone unveiling arrived three weeks later. Mom had been counting down to this moment since the funeral ended. She desperately needed that closure and permanent place to visit dad. My other brother, Simon, drove her to the cemetery that morning. I met them there with fresh flowers for the grave. Chet said he'd meet us there, but texted that he was running late. The cemetery worker LED us to Dad's lot in the memorial garden section. A black cloth covered the new granite stone that had just been installed. Mom was already crying while clutching

My wife Rachel and I have been married eight years, and every single year she insists on driving 12 hours to visit her family in California. I live in Colorado, so it's not exactly a quick trip. When we first got married, we'd fly out there, but ever since our daughter Mia turned 2, Rachel decided we had to drive because it's safer for kids. The thing is, Rachel Overpacks like we're moving there permanently. I'm talking about filling our entire SUV from floor to ceiling. We upgraded from my old Honda to a massive Chevy Suburban specifically because she complained about not having enough space. Guess what happened? She filled that thing up, too. I literally can't see out my side mirrors because she stacks stuff that high and we don't use 90% of what she brings. Packs like five different outfits for every single day we're there. Last time she brought an entire tote bag just filled with towels because she doesn't trust hotel towels. Another tote bag with blankets because hotel comforters are gross. She even packed our coffee maker because she doesn't like the hotel coffee. The worst part isn't even the over packing, though. It's that she's always three hours late to everything. I'll tell her we need to leave at 10 in the morning to make good time. She'll roll out of bed at 11:30, take an hour to get ready, then suddenly remember she Needs to pack the car. We never actually leave until past noon. Then she wants to drive until midnight to make up for lost time. I'm stuck driving 12 hours straight while she's in the passenger seat telling me I'm going too slow or too fast. The drive becomes this miserable Marathon where we're both exhausted and cranky. This past weekend was supposed to be different though. My company sent me to a conference in Vegas. Nice resort, great location.

He starts pacing around my bed like he's got something major to confess. I'm thinking he's gonna tell me his mom's coming to visit or something normal.

He starts rambling about how Emma doesn't look like him and how babies are supposed to look like their dads. Emma has dark hair and Jake's blonde. That's literally it. That's his entire reasoning. Never mind that my entire family has dark hair, including me. Never mind that most babies don't look like anyone specific when they're brand new. But it gets worse. He pulls out his phone and starts showing me Google searches about paternity fraud. Apparently he's been researching this for weeks. While I was pregnant. While I was Throwing up every morning and couldn't sleep because of heartburn and swollen feet. I told him he was being ridiculous and that I've never cheated on him once in our two year relationship. I don't even have guy friends he doesn't know about. My whole world has basically been work, him and preparing for this baby. He gets all defensive and says it's not about trust, it's about being sure that any responsible father would want to know for certain. That he's seen too many stories online about men raising kids that weren't theirs. The nurse walked in right as I started crying, and Jake immediately shuts up and pretends to be the supportive boyfriend. As soon as she leaves, he starts up again about how this is normal and lots of couples.

Their landlord was being a complete ass and wasn't fixing their heating, so they needed somewhere warm to stay while they figured things out. I felt bad for them, honestly. It was December and freezing cold outside. Two weeks turned into six months real quick.

They expected me to cook for four people every single night, but never offered to help or buy groceries. I'd come home exhausted from work, and his mom would be like, oh, good, you're home.

They were eating us out of house and home. His dad would finish entire boxes of cereal for breakfast, and his mom would make these huge sandwiches with, like, half a loaf of bread. When I brought it up to my husband, he just shrugged and said, they're going through a tough time. We need to be patient. But patient for what, exactly? Neither of them were even looking for jobs. They weren't apartment hunting. They weren't doing anything except making our lives miserable. The breaking point was when I found his mom going through our mail.

My daughter Ellie, at 16, started a small business making custom jewelry, mostly earrings and bracelets. She sold at local craft fairs and built a steady following online. Nothing crazy, just enough money to save up for college. Last summer, another mom from Ellie's school, Becky, ordered matching bracelets for herself and her daughters. Simple job. Ellie finished them in a day. Two weeks later, Becky showed up at our door, red faced and furious. He demanded Ellie refund her immediately, yelling about a severe allergic reaction caused by the bracelets. Ellie was mortified and apologized profusely, quickly refunding Becky. I didn't think much of it until Becky started bad mouthing Ellie online, tanking her reputation and ending the business overnight. I was angry, but let it go. Six months later, I ran into Becky's husband at the pharmacy. He saw me buying allergy medication and asked if I was okay. Confused, I mentioned Becky's bracelet reaction. He paused, then laughed bitterly. Bracelets? Becky never wore them. She sold them online. She used the money to buy diet pills that put her in the hospital. Turns out Becky had blamed Ellie to hide her secret shopping addiction from her husband. Ellie never restarted her business, but Becky's marriage imploded, accurately for the world. Danny and I had been getting close again, but we didn't want to rush anything. Then I got pregnant with Jake at 32, and We both cried when we found out. Happy tears, but also terrified tears. Because what if the cancer came back? It did. When Jake was two. I felt that same exhaustion creeping in. This time it was worse.

Sort it yourself. My fiance Marcus had this nine year old daughter named Kayla from his previous marriage. The kid was honestly pretty sweet when it was just the three of us hanging out, but the second her mom came into the picture, everything went to hell. Marcus and his ex wife had this weird custody thing where they never actually talk to each other directly. Everything went through Kayla, which was already messed up enough. But then his ex started using me as her personal messenger service. It started small. She'd text me instead of Marcus about pickup times or if Kayla forgot her backpack. I thought she was just being friendly at first, trying to include me since I was going to be Kayla's stepmom soon. But then it got weird. She'd send me these long messages about how Kayla was acting up at her house, how she needed new school clothes, how Marcus wasn't paying enough child support, stuff that had nothing to do with me. When I tell Marcus about it, he just shrug and say his ex was crazy and to ignore her. The breaking point came last Tuesday. I was at work when my phone started blowing up. Kayla's mom was texting me non stop because apparently Kayla had gotten in trouble at school for hitting another kid. The principal had called both parents, but Marcus wasn't answering his phone because he was in meetings all Day so his ex decides that I need to leave work immediately and go handle it. She's sending me message after message telling me I need to go pick up Kayla, that she can't leave her job, that this is what being a stepmom means. She even said I was being selfish for not dropping everything. I looked at my phone and just lost it. I texted back exactly what I was thinking. I told her that Kayla isn't my daughter, I'm not married to Marcus yet, and I'm not responsible for fixing their parenting disasters. I said she needed to figure out her own custody drama and leave me out of it. She immediately called Marcus screaming about how I was abandoning his daughter.

So his team had to fix everything. I'm talking coming home at two in the morning, eating cold leftovers, showering and passing out. Some nights I'd find him literally sleeping face first in his dinner plate or passed out on the bathroom floor with the shower still running. Two nights ago, he finally stumbled through the door around midnight with this huge grin on his exhausted face. We did it, he said. Boss gave us the rest of the week off. He ate some leftover pizza, took the world's quickest shower and was snoring before his head hit the pillow. Next morning around 9, I made breakfast but let him sleep. Poor guy looked like a zombie for weeks. Around noon, my parents showed up unannounced. I'm six months pregnant, so they visit sometimes to check on me. We're sitting there having coffee when my mom asks where Tyler is. Since his truck's in the driveway, he's still sleeping, I said. My mom's face went all pinched. It's past noon. That's unacceptable with a pregnant wife. Wake him up. I explained the whole situation. Three weeks of hell. Fifty million dollar crisis. Barely any sleep. My dad just shook his head like Tyler was some lazy bum. I'm not waking him up, I said. He needs to rest. Well, if you won't do it, I will, my mom said, standing up and heading for the stairs. I jumped up and blocked her path. If you can't respect my husband getting proper sleep after three weeks of torture, then you need to leave our house now! Are you kicking us out? My dad asked, all shocked. Yes, get out! They left, all huffy and dramatic.

You know, college, three kids, money problems, all of it. Our oldest is 12 now. Then there's Emma, who's 11, and our little guy, Jake, who's 4. But when Emma was 3, Danny's work schedule went completely insane. He was pulling 80 hour weeks, sometimes sleeping at the office. I was basically a single mom raising three kids while he chased some promotion that never came. We fought constantly. The house felt empty even when he was there because he was always on his phone or laptop. One night, after he missed Jake's first steps because of another emergency meeting, I told him I was done. We divorced six months later. It wasn't dramatic or messy, just sad. We both knew it wasn't working anymore. Two years later, I started feeling tired all the time. Like, couldn't get out of bed tired. Went to the doctor thinking it was stress or maybe low iron. Nope. Cancer. Age 2. At first, which scared the hell out of me, but felt manageable. Danny found out through Emma, who overheard me talking to my sister. He showed up at my door that same night with groceries and this look on his face, like someone had punched him in the gut. Why didn't you tell me? He kept asking. The funny thing is, going through chemo actually brought us closer than we'd been in years. He cut his hours way back to help with the kids and drive me to appointments. We'd sit in those awful hospital chairs for hours, just talking about random stuff. T V. Shows what the kids were doing. Stupid memories from when we were young. I beat it the first time. Remission at 31. And I felt like I could conquer.

Zane held up an orange prescription bottle. Then why do you have mefloquine stone? This is abortion medication. It terminates pregnancies. I laughed nervously. That's not mine. I would never. Jasper, is this yours? The silence was deafening. Zane looked between us, realization dawning on his face. There's only two people who live here, I said, as Zane started reading the prescription label. Filled last month and the month before. My stomach dropped. My miscarriages, I whispered. I've had four miscarriages in 23 months. I stood up slowly, my legs shaking. You've been poisoning me. You've been calling our babies. Jasper backed against the counter, his face gray. It's not Walmart. You think? Then explain why abortion medication is in our house. While I'm taking fertility supplements, I said, my voice rising. While I inject myself with hormones. While I've been blaming my body for failing us, you called our children. The words came out raw, broken. Your mother called me defective at Thanksgiving, asked if maybe we should explore other options. Your sister announced her third pregnancy at Christmas, and everyone looked at me with pity. My voice was rising even more. I refused my Promotion to reduce stress. I gave up coffee, wine, sushi, even my anxiety medication to increase the odds. Jasper opened his mouth. The doctor said stress could. Don't you dare! I cut him off. Don't you dare quote the doctors to me! Zane stood frozen. I did three rounds of Clomid that made me so sick I couldn't work. They shot dye through my fallopian tubes. Do you know how much that hurts, Jasper? While you were poisoning me, I was letting doctors torture me to find out why I couldn't stay pregnant. We named our babies. I continued, tears streaming. Now you remember how we picked them out together? Phoenix, Sage, Indigo, Xavier. I was knitting their baby blankets while you were making sure they'd never need them. Jasper's hands were trembling. Reaching out like he was the one who needed comfort. Zane's face suddenly went wider than it had been.

We're two months behind on the electrical, but her friend says this app is the only way to keep family safe and honest. I'm 17 and work part time at target while my dad does construction. We don't have time to be anything but safe and honest. He says if we have nothing to hide, we have nothing to fear. Which sounds like something a dictator would say, but whatever.

It shows your speed when driving, your phone battery, and sends notification for everything, including when someone checks someone else's location. Mom works from home doing medical billing and has nothing but time to watch that app all day while dad and I are actually out in the world. Perfect! Now I'll know everyone's safe, she says. But what she means is now she can watch us like the musical Jolly Chimp from Toy Story. Her phone buzzes and she glances at it. Oh, shoot, I have a doctor's appointment in an hour. Dad offers to drive her, but she says no, she needs the car. All day for errands. After months ago, my mom asked me to start covering for her when she goes out saying she shopping or at the doctors.

Dad text she checked me 14 times this morning and we both realize she's literally sitting there refreshing the app constantly instead of working. Day 3. Mom calls me screaming because the app says I was going 67 in a 65 and threatens to take my keys. So I start driving under the speed limit, which means I'm late to work and my manager writes me up. Dad gets stuck in traffic, won't go even 1 mile per hour over.

Guess who came begging for help? I was born two months premature and stayed small my whole life. 90 pounds through high school, while my brother came out 11 months later looking like he was meant for a Nike commercial. Dad immediately decided which son was worth his time by middle school. My brother's the star quarterback and I'm still getting mistaken for someone's little sister at the grocery store. Freshman year I tried joining J V. Football to be part of something, and during tryouts my brother walks over from varsity practice and tells the coach in front of everyone that weakness is contagious and I'll make the whole team soft. Coach actually listens to a 14 year old because my brother's already locally famous. Dad hears about this at dinner and instead of defending me he laughs and says my brother has a point, even suggest I try chess club instead. I get a job at the local gym cleaning the equipment just to be around fitness. My brother brings his teammates there specifically to point at me mopping and tell them not to get too close or my weak jeans might jump onto them. They all laugh like it's the funniest thing they've ever heard. Senior year my brother gets a full ride scholarship to date and my parents throw a huge party I only found out about through Instagram and when I asked dad why I wasn't invited He said it was for athletes only. I start working out at 3 in the morning when nobody's around to laugh, and gym owner notices my dedication and offers to train me for free. First year I gained 15 pounds of muscle, which isn't much, but it's something. I start posting progress videos online with hashtag contagious strength because I'm petty and it feels good. My brother wins state championship his senior year, but tears his ACL in his first college game.

The only reason he even volunteered for the camping trip was to co chaperone with the beautiful Miss Dizon. But of course, don't let his wife know, right? So while he was there trying to impress her with his wilderness expertise, a baby bear cub wandered into our campsite, sniffing around me and the other students. He stumbled back and pointed at it. Mister V, there's a bear! He yelled in a high pitched voice. Mister IV looked over and laughed at our worried expression. Are you seriously scared of a little moving build? A bear? It's smaller than my Labrador. He walked over and picked up the cub on the back of its neck and held it up like a stop animal, winking at Miss I Dizon. See? You kids need to toughen up when we get back to school. 10 laps, all of you! He laughed as the cub cried and squealed before kicking it into the bushes. There, done. Now everyone go to bed. When we tried to say something, he cut us off. Anyone who disrupts adult conversation gets detention for a week. He turned to Miss Dizon, who was sitting by the fire. These city kids are so dramatic. Wanna check out the stars by the lake? Better view away from all these tents. I giggled and stood up. Lead the way. When they were gone, all of us looked at each Other with wide eyes. We all knew something bad was going to happen. I hate to be the bringer of bad news, Daphne said, cutting through the tension, but didn't our biology teacher warn us that a baby bear always mean the mother is nearby? Another kid with glasses nodded. My uncle survived a bear attack and told us never to mess with a cub. So what should we do? While we all stood there trying to figure out what to do, the smart kid Alex, started moving all our food and coolers to an empty tent opposite from where we were sleeping. Are you guys gonna help or what? We practically sprang into action, carrying all our snacks into the same tent, filling it up like we were making an offering to some local deity. Mr. V snuck up on us and yelled, what are you doing with all the food?

No contact with family. My sister Tara got a German Shepherd for her 16th birthday. I got a card. The dog's name was Jack's and he cost $3,000 from a champion bloodline. My parents built him a heated dog house that cost more than my car. When Jax bit me the first week, dad said I must have bothered him. Jax killed my childhood cat, peaches, three months later. I'd raised peaches from a kitten bottle, fed her when she was abandoned. I found her lifeless in the backyard one morning. My parents shrugged and said cats were boring anyway, that dogs had personality. They refused to let me bury her properly because it might upset Jax to smell another animal in his yard. I buried peaches at my friend's house and cried alone. I paid for my own college, working three jobs. Sarah dropped out sophomore year to become a dog trainer. She'd never trained Jax to even sit yet. My parents bought her a 40 thousand dollar mobile grooming van for her new career. The business lasted two months. I graduated nursing school with honours. My parents couldn't make it to graduation. Jax's had a vet appointment when Tara's dog turned 1. They threw a party with 50 guests. Then Jax attacked my neighbour's poodle. My parents paid the vet bills and bought Tara a second German Shepherd to keep Jax's company. When I asked for help with my textbooks, mom said, that's My responsibility. The second dog's name was Athena. She was worse than Jax. Together, they destroyed my childhood bedroom. During Thanksgiving, I found peaches hidden toys under my bed torn to shreds. My parents laughed and said, dogs will be dogs. Everything unraveled when I met Steven. We dated two years before getting engaged. My parents said they were thrilled, but never asked about wedding plans. When I mentioned wedding costs, they suggested courthouse ceremonies were more intimate. At the same time, Tara announced Jack's needed surgery for hip dysplasia. My parents spent $15,000 without blinking. Then Jack's destroyed my wedding dress. During the fitting, Tara had brought him to my appointment uninvited. He jumped on me with muddy paws and tore the train clean off. The dress was ruined.

When I turned eighteen, my parents sat me down for what they called a long overdue conversation. You need to move out, mom announced. Every disaster in this house happens because you're constantly provoking Gonzales. I stared in disbelief while my 14 year old brother Gonzales sat there looking innocent. The kitchen fire last week, the destroyed laptop, the hole in the garage door. It's always when you two are together. We need peace. You have two weeks to find somewhere else to live. Gonzalez smiled sweetly. I just want our family to be safe, he said, hiding behind my parents backs as he mouth goodbye. Fine. If they wanted me to stop protecting them from Hurricane Gonzalez, I'd wish them good luck. The day after I moved out, Gonzalez decided to upgrade the house's electrical system. Every light in the neighborhood now flickered in rhythm with our toaster. When mom tried to make toast. It activated the garage door, the ceiling fans, and somehow started Dad's car. The power company had to shut down our entire grid and rewire our house. The Bill was $3,000. It's synchronized living, Gonzalez explained proudly to the electrician. Next, he discovered online chemistry tutorials without me. Secretly replacing his chemicals with baking soda, he created what he called rainbow smoke bombs in the kitchen. But they were actually just straight up acid that ate through the tiles and corrupted all the food. Hazmat had to gut our kitchen entirely. Total cost $8,000. Why didn't you tell us this would happen? Mom yelled at me through the phone. I did. You just never listened. I reminded her. Then Gonzales revealed he'd been training squirrels in the attic. They're my army, he explained, as 20 squirrels wearing tiny tin foil hats descended through the ceiling during Dad's Zoom meeting with his boss. Dad got fired on the spot. Then came the car improvement.

In my family, there was one rule. I needed my twin's permission to seek medical help. I was watching Vanessa practice her birthday speech when my lungs seized up. I reached for my inhaler on the coffee table, but mom snatched it away. Vanessa, does Ellie need this? My twin didn't even look up from her phone. She used it at lunch. She's fine. You heard your sister. Mom dropped my inhaler in her purse. No attention seeking today. It's Vanessa's sweet 16. The rule had been in place since we were 12. The day I faked pneumonia during Vanessa's ballet recital. I hadn't faked it, but Vanessa said I had, so that became the truth. From then on, every headache, every fever, every asthma attack had to be verified by the golden twin. Can't breathe. The wheeze was starting. That whistling sound my doctor called your body's alarm bell. Ellie, Dad's voice boomed from the doorway. What do we do when you claim you're sick? I knew the script. Ask Vanessa first. And what did Vanessa say? Vanessa finally looked up, annoyed. I said, she's fine. Gosh, Ellie, do you have to make my day about you? My chest was tightening like someone was sitting on it. Each breath felt like sucking air through a coffee stirrer. Please! I gasped. Need hospital, mom! Vanessa whined. She's doing it again! Make her stop! Mom rushed to comfort Vanessa. Don't worry, Sweetie! Ellie, go to your room if you're going to act like this. The modelling scout will be here soon. I tried to stand, but had to grip the couch. My fingernails were starting to tinge blue. Look! I held up my hands. Vanessa laughed. She probably painted them blue. Remember when she faked passing out at my recital? I hadn't faked it. I had an asthma attack. But Vanessa told everyone I was jealous. So my parents refused to leave her performance. The doorbell rang. Party guests started to arrive. Ellie, disappear! Dad ordered.

When I rushed into the ER carrying my bleeding grandbaby. I came home from the most important presentation of my career to find my 11 month old granddaughter screaming and kicking on the living room floor, all alone, with a large gash on her head from where she had hit the coffee table. And my daughter, the actual mother of the baby, who had swore this time she'd stay and watch over her, nowhere to be found. I was shocked, furious, in desperate tears as I scooped her up and called for an ambulance. The nurses took her for a CT scan immediately while I filled out forms with shaking hands. Is she going to be okay? Please tell me she's going to be okay, I begged. Where did this happen? The intake nurse asked coolly. I hesitated. At home, she fell off the couch. Are you the mother of the child? I shook my head. Grandmother? The nurse raised an eyebrow. Where is the mother now? I opened my mouth to speak, but I wasn't even sure how to answer her. I opened up Instagram from my phone and found her post from an hour ago. Enjoying a nice smooch with a stranger at a music festival. How long was the baby unsupervised? The doctor asked when he came out. Maybe a few hours. I kept calling my daughter. Straight to voicemail every time the hospital called. The Police. In the meantime, a social worker approached me in the waiting room and called my daughter on her personal phone. This isn't normal for her, I tried to explain. She's young. She's still figuring things out. The social worker just stared at me, expressionless. When my daughter picked up, she spoke bluntly. Your baby is in the hospital, and that custody of yours is hanging on a thread. So show up, Bam! And call. The social worker pulled out her tablet. Now let's talk about what normal looks like. How often do you watch the baby? Well, at first it was just during classes, and now I bit my lip. More often she waited? Yes, okay, every night. But I'm her mother. And I'm that baby's grandmother. You got how to understand I. When was the last time your daughter spent a full 24 hours with her baby? She interrupted writing out a long list on her case file. When I couldn't answer, she scribbled even more on her clip.

I work in semiconductors, where precision matters in circuits and apparently not in HR complaints. This started when management moved a new girl, 22, to my department, and I, thirty four, had to train her. This woman had quite the reputation around our facility. Multiple guys had mysteriously disappeared from the company after working with her, with whispered break room stories about false reports and HR drama following in her wake. Her personnel file probably needed its own storage cabinet at this point. From day one, her behavior was off. At first, she was oddly shy around me, but that quickly evolved into something else entirely. As the days passed, she got increasingly flirtatious and super hands on. All touchy feely. She'd even mention how cute she thought I was and so on. I'll admit I did play along with her, but never in any kind of inappropriate way. She added me on social media and we swapped info since she'd mentioned wanting to hang out. So I guess one weekend she saw on social media that I'd gone to the park. When Monday rolled around, the atmosphere had shifted dramatically. She barely spoke to me, slammed equipment down, and gave me death glares across the clean room. Turns out she was mad that I didn't call her, which felt really immature and honestly just nuts. Especially since we never actually made any real plans or anything. A few Weeks later, that same flirty energy was still going strong. Then I ended up out sick for a few days with a nasty stomach bug. I couldn't keep anything down, not even water. So I stayed home.

I became a parent at 7 years old, the day I realized my sister Eve would starve if I didn't learn to cook. Our parents worked 18 hour days and treated the office like their real home, while I Learned to pack Eve's lunch in the specific blue container she needed and her sandwiches into perfect triangles. By 9, I could forge their signatures perfectly and knew exactly how to calm her meltdowns. By 16, I scheduled her doctor visits and set alarms to give her medicine on time. Eve would fall asleep by the front door waiting for them to come home, rocking with her weighted blanket. And I'd carry her to bed at midnight, whispering that I'd always be there, even if they weren't. So when Stanford accepted me, I stared at the letter, knowing I couldn't leave her alone for two more years of high school. She caught me crying and grabbed my shoulders. You have to go. I don't like when you're sad, she said, rocking slightly. Parents suddenly appeared when they heard Stanford's name, actually proud for once and lecturing me about opportunities I couldn't pass up. But I told them I couldn't leave Eve alone, not when she needed someone who understood her routines and could advocate for her at school. For the first time in years, they actually look at me, and I watched something break in Mom's face. Oh, god, she whispered. You've been doing our job since second grade. All this time working to afford the best life for you two, and we haven't even been here to live it with you. Dad couldn't look at me when he finally spoke. Starting tomorrow, being here comes first. And for three beautiful months, they became the best parents. Dad Learned Eve's morning routine, mom attended parent teacher conferences, and they both showed up to her sophomore year orientation. Eve called me at Stanford listing every dinner detail they used. The smooth plates. Dad didn't mix her foods. Mom turned the TV volume to 16, not 17. They and photos of themselves at her art showcase. And Eve's smile in those pictures made the homesickness worth it. She even called one night. Very serious. I have a boyfriend, mom, and dad like him. He helps me at school. I felt grateful hearing her sound happy about normal teenage things. But when I came home two years later for her graduation, I realized she was living anything but a normal.

First day of high school and I was already making people laugh. Missus Corillo didn't smile, though. She looked down at her attendance sheet and then back at me with this confused I'm sorry, what's your name again? Moises Cabrera, I said, even though I literally just told her two minutes ago. When I walked in, she scanned her paper again and shook her head slowly. I don't have a says Cabrera on my roster. Are you sure you're in the right classroom? Donnie looked at me like I was about to get in trouble already. I pulled out my schedule to double check, even though I knew I was right. Yeah, statistics 1A with Missus Corillo. Room 2 0 4. This is 2:04, right? She walked over to my desk and looked at my schedule. Then she said the words that ruined everything. You need to go to the main office. You're not supposed to be here. The whole class was staring at me as I grabbed my backpack and walked out. My face was burning with embarrassment. Kids were already whispering and pulling out their phones, probably to Text everyone about the kid who showed up to the wrong class like an idiot. The main office was packed with confused freshman trying to fix their schedules. I waited in line for 20 minutes before finally reaching the front desk, where this tired looking lady with glasses asked what I needed. My statistics teacher says I'm not on her roster, but this is definitely my schedule. I showed her the paper I'd gotten in the mail two weeks ago. She typed something into her computer and frowned, then typed more and frowned deeper. Moises Cabrera. You're not enrolled at this school. What do you mean I'm not enrolled? I literally live three blocks away. I went to the same middle school as everyone else. I graduated in June. My voice was getting higher and people were starting to stare again. She turned her monitor toward me and pointed at the screen.

I had this one kid in my class whose IQ was probably a few points higher than Homer Simpsons. I found this on my first day when he took out a blender, then interrupted class to ask if anyone had any fruit so he could make a smoothie. That same day, I left the class for a minute to laminate something, and when I came back, he was at my desk eating my lunch. He said that he needed something to eat with his drink and thought it was out there for everyone to snack on. Two weeks later, during his first test, he wrote your name beside the write your name heading at the top. He was by far the worst performing student in the class because he was always on his phone, even during tests. Whenever he'd stay after school to catch up on work, he'd tell me he's always on his phone because he's making money. At the time, I just brushed it off and told him he still can't use it in class. But one day, in the middle of a test, he screamed, oh, my god! Yes! In one motion, he stood up and took off running to the bathroom, accidentally knocking down the girl who was in the chair beside him. He came back 10 minutes later, and I told him to stay behind after class. I asked him what that was. All about. And he went on to tell me that when he said he makes money on his phone during class, he wasn't lying. He then told me that he does that stock trading thing and said while checking his green and red arrows, I noticed one of his stocks boomed and made him a lot of money. I didn't believe a word, but then he showed me the proof. He opened an app called Bloom in front of me and showed me his portfolio. This kid who was genuinely failing Algebra 1, had made over $400 profit in a couple of months. He told me he started from zero and just use the rewards the app gives you to start. I was sort of interested by this and asked him if he could give me some tips to start myself. He replied, I don't really know what I'm doing. Just get bloom.

When I was in elementary school, my best friend was a girl named Raquel. And because I was a very anxious and shy kid, I let her walk all over me. I did her homework for her and gave her the treats out of my lunch. And in return, she'd throw me under the bus constantly. I remember people started rumors about me and my family, but instead of defending me, she laughed at me with them. The worst part was how the very next day, she'd come up to me acting like nothing happened, and then once again asked me to do her homework. We're best friends, and best friends do things for each other, she'd say. There was one time she began punching my arm for seemingly no reason, so I grabbed her hands to make her stop. She suddenly began crying loudly, and everyone came to her defense, including our teacher, who told me, why don't you back off? I think you did enough for today. I was kept alone in the classroom during lunchtime, and when everyone came back, there was a rumor that I had tried to choke her to death. I tried to tell everyone I just held onto her hands when she was punching me, but no one believed me. And there she was in the middle of the crowd, not saying a word, taking in all the love and attention from the Class. I somehow finally came to my senses when we were 8. She invited me for a sleepover at her place. We were watching Pirates of the Caribbean, fangirling over Johnny Depp, when at one point during the movie, she told me I could rest my head on her if I felt tired. I did just that towards the end of the movie, and she shrugged me off of her. I asked why she did that, and she said, I never said you could put your head on me. If you do this again, I'll stab you. I laughed awkwardly, thinking she was joking or something. She said, I'm serious. There's a knife in the kitchen I stole from my mom. It's under the fridge. If you touch me again, I'll unalive you. I kept silent until her mom sent us to bed. Curiosity got the best of me and

When I was 12, I called CPS, but not to protect myself. I just been adopted by a couple who could never have their own kids. And they seem so nice. At first, they never yelled at me like my bio mom or dad did. They gave me ice cream just for existing. And they tucked me into bed with hot chocolate by my bedside every night. I was convinced any kid would be lucky to have them as parents. That's why when I found out they had miraculously gotten pregnant, I cheered. However, that's when things changed. It was like a switch. But not in the way they treated me, rather, in the way they treated him. My adoptive parents instantly became obsessed with Raising Jacob as this perfect and gifted child. They hung this huge chart in the kitchen marking every milestone the day they took him from the hospital. If Jacob didn't sit up, walk, or talk exactly when the internet said he should, they get this anxious look and start whispering to each other. By the time Jacob was nine months old, they were already making him do these daily flashcards. I watched from the hallway as my dad sighed heavily whenever Jacob got distracted or confused. It felt weird and uncomfortable, but I thought maybe they were just stressed out about being new parents. It got worse when Jacob turned 2. They signed him up For these advanced toddler classes, trying to teach him Latin on top of English at home, they spent hours drilling him on letters and numbers. If Jacob got something wrong, they tense up, their faces showing clear disappointment. Sometimes Jacob would cry at night. Instead of comforting him, they'd stand over his crib with their arms folded until he stopped. They said it would build character. I started noticing how anxious Jacob got all the time. He'd pick nervously at his fingers. His eyes always looked like he was waiting for someone to yell at him. One night after a preschool meeting, I heard his teacher mention that Jacob was struggling socially. On the drive home, my parents lectured Jacob non stop about embarrassing the family. He sat silently in his car seat, tears rolling down his cheeks. From that day, dinner became a nightmare. Jacob was no longer allowed to eat until he perfectly recited whatever they drilled him on that day.

Lucy called me instead of our parents because I was only 10 minutes away while they were both at work. I rushed to the pharmacy and grabbed pads, tampons, and even some chocolate because I wasn't sure what she needed. Got to the school in eight minutes flat. Lucy was hiding behind the gym building, tears streaming down her face, trying to cover the stain on her shorts with her backpack. I met her at the side gate and handed her the bag through the fence. He thanked me and ran inside to the bathroom. I waited in my car to make sure she was okay, playing some music and texting my mom about what happened. Everything seemed fine, then I saw this older teacher walking toward my car. He looked angry and was talking on his phone. Within minutes, three more staff members surrounded my Honda as security guard knocked on my window and told me to step out immediately. The teacher said he witnessed me talking to a distressed female student behind the building. He claimed the girl looked scared and ran away after I gave her something. They asked for my ID and started questioning me about why I was On school property during class hours. I tried explaining that Lucy was my sister, but they weren't listening. The counselor said the student was too upset to talk and that my story didn't add up. They called the police.

My dad missed my graduation for a job interview. Mom promised he'd make it, but kept checking her phone anxiously during the entire ceremony. I felt my heart sink when I scanned the crowd and didn't see his face anywhere. After walking across that stage, I gripped my phone, waiting for something. No texts, no calls. Complete silence. Mom couldn't look me in the eyes when I found her afterward, she hugged me way too tight and whispered, he really tried, sweetheart. My chest burned with anger. I couldn't hide anymore. At my graduation party, relatives kept asking about dad. Mom cycled through increasingly desperate excuses. Traffic jam, work emergency, car trouble, each lie more pathetic than the last. I watched her stumble through explanations while my shame grew deeper. My friend Jake pulled me aside and asked, you doing okay, man? I just laughed and said, he's been doing this since I was 7 years old, because it was absolutely true. He missed my championship basketball game where I scored the winning shot. Missed my debate team finals when I took first place. Even missed my 18th birthday party last year. Said he had to work late again that night.

And in it she admitted she'd lied about who my real father was. My dad Trevor, had always been this gentle guy who worked nights at the factory and came home smelling like metal and machine oil. Mom would heat up his dinner plate at 2:00am when his shift ended. He'd kiss my forehead before I went to school, even when I pretended to be asleep. Normal dad stuff. But I always wondered why I looked nothing like him. I'm tall with dark hair and green eyes. Dad's short with blond hair and brown eyes. Mom always said I got lucky with the gene pool. That sometimes kids just look different. I believed her, because what kid questions that? When Grandma Rose died last month, she left me this speed up leather diary from 1987. I almost threw it away until I found the page with my name on it. She'd written about the night I was born. How mom was crying in the hospital room, begging grandma to never tell anyone the truth about who my real father was. Turns out my actual father is Mom's boss at the insurance office where she worked before I was born. His name is David Walsh. Grandma wrote that mom had an affair with him for six months when she got pregnant. He wanted nothing to do with it. He was married with two kids of his own. Mom was terrified and ashamed. So when Trevor asked her to marry him three months later, she said yes and never told him I wasn't his. I sat in my car outside Mom's house for an hour, holding that diary, trying to figure out what to say. When I finally went inside, she was folding laundry in the living room. I just put the diary on the coffee table and watched her face go white. She didn't even try to deny it. She just started crying and said she never wanted me to find out because Trevor had been such a good father to me. She begged me not to tell him because it would destroy him. The weird part was, I wasn't even angry at her. I was angry at this David guy who basically abandoned me before I was even born. So I looked him up online. He still works at the same insurance.

My biological parents put me up for adoption the second I was born, and the foster home I was put in, I never felt loved or cared for in the slightest. My foster parents were secret alcoholics, and the only adult figure in my life I genuinely liked was Janice, my homeroom teacher. She smiled when she said hello to me, and she'd give me her chocolate bar to make sure I had lunch. It was more warmth than I had ever felt in my life. And some days she'd even stay after class to help me get better at reading and writing. It was during one of these that Janice found out I was a foster kid. Broke down to her about how I just wanted to be a normal kid with a family and whose parents wanted him. Janice just hugged me tight. She sat me down and told me that she was also a foster child in the past, and from that day on, there was a true connection between us. Started seeing her as a motherly figure. When the final year of elementary school ended, it was time to say goodbye to Janice. I hugged her and cried to her on the last day of the school year. I didn't want to say goodbye to her, and I know she didn't either, because she suggested something to me. She wiped my tears. And asked me if I wanted her to be my foster mom. My eyes went wide, I smiled harder than I ever had before, and began nodding and repeating yes. I used every method of communication I knew at once to let her know I wanted this. And she just smiled. My alcoholic foster parents were more than happy to get rid of me, as they put it, and Janice welcomed me into her home with open arms. I've been living with her for three years now, and she is the best damn mom any kid could ever dream of having. She is so kind. She makes me

What's the reality? Viewers never saw. My parents wanted to be famous Youtubers for years. So when they had kids, they knew this was the perfect time. They developed a family channel where cameras were in every room, scripts were taped to the fridge, and every holiday, every family dinner, every moment was filmed. Made us rehearse how to laugh, how to hug, how to cry. If you cried wrong, you did it again. And if you still made a mistake, they would pull out a small bottle of lemon juice and place two drops in each eye. So I Learned how to get it right the first time. People online called us perfect. And I agree. We were perfect. Perfectly fake. Mom practiced sad speeches in the mirror to start her day, while my dad made my brother refilm lines for brand deals at 4 in the morning, right before classes. They taught me how to smile and flirt with the camera. My parents controlled all of my meals. Keep being at just below 1,000 calories daily. It was really bad, but I was told that I had it good compared to everyone else. It wasn't until I turned 15 when my health collapsed that I started saying no. I refused a product because it gave me a rash so severe that I had to go to the hospital and take topical treatment for two weeks. Was the last time I smiled for a camera. I didn't set up myself. The day after I recovered, my parents set me up for another makeup brand, saying that it wouldn't give me a rash this time. I said no and hid in the bathroom. Before filming, my mom tried saying sweet and encouraging things through the stall door, but when it didn't work, she started kicking and violently pulling on the handle. She screamed out that I was being selfish and was just a stupid teenager who needed to learn how to listen to my parents. When she gave up, she filmed me crying in the stall, pretending to be a caring person by giving me space to control my emotions. Afterwards, she called me difficult and took my phone privileges away for a week. When I got it back, I started recording everything. I had clips of my mom feeding my brother spicy food to make him cry, my dad scream.

But every time she mentioned moving, I could see my kids get this look on their faces. Emma started having trouble sleeping. Tyler asked me three times in one week if we were really going to move. The breaking point came two weeks ago. Lauren had been on the phone with her daughter for an hour, crying about missing some school event. When she hung up, she looked at me and said she was done waiting for me to come around. She said she was moving with or without us. I sat down at the kitchen table and said, if that's what she needed to do, then maybe we should get divorced. She stared at me like I'd slapped her. She asked how I could just throw away our marriage like that. I told her I wasn't throwing anything away, but I wouldn't sacrifice my kids happiness for our relationship. We've talked about it every day since then. Lauren keeps asking if there's anything she can say to change my mind. She suggested the kids could visit their grandparents during summers and holidays. She said they'd love the new city once they got used to it. She even offered to wait until Tyler finished elementary school. But I know my kids. Emma's already dealing with anxiety about middle school next year. Tyler still has nightmares about his mom. Sometimes moving them away from everyone they love would mess them up. I can't do that to them. Yesterday, Told me she already put a deposit down on an apartment near her ex. She said she hoped I'd come to my senses before she has to move next month. When I didn't say anything, she got angry and said I was choosing my kids over her. Kids like mine matter more. That hurt because it's not about whose kids matter more. It's about doing what's right for the kids who depend on me. Lauren's kids chose to move with their dad. They wanted to go. My kids didn't choose any of this. They just want to stay in the only home they remember. Lauren thinks I'm being stubborn and that I don't understand what it's like to be separated from your children. But she's wrong.

This generation is completely wack. I remember being 14 and still having braces and wearing ugly blue eyeshadow to school every day. But this was before social media, so all of my friends were just as ugly as me. But on my daughter's 15th birthday, we went out to Chili's, and what she wore was shocking. Not because it was anything crazy revealing. It was just a corset top and some cargo pants. It made me realize the pressure she had to grow up faster. She even did her makeup. And I swear, my baby Annalise looked 23 years old. And as we sat down, the waiter began to flirt with her. I wasn't really paying attention because I figured she'd turn him down or just act really shy. But in the corner of my eye, I saw her batting her eyes and looking up at him with a single finger twirling her hair. Motherly rage flooded my system. I literally saw the bulge in his pants. Hey, do you guys have a birthday candle with the No. 15? Because that's how old my daughter is turning today. Luckily, the guy went super red and started stammering, so I knew that he had simply been blindsided. And we even got switched to a new later. As for my daughter, I didn't want to ruin her birthday, so I let her change the topic, and we just Talked about something else. But when she woke up the next day, I asked her what the f she thought she was doing. That she could wear what she wanted, but there was no way I'd ever let her date anyone over the age of 17. We did that teenage angst thing where they pinch the bridge of their nose and roll their eyes like. It was the most original move in the book. So I grabbed her phone and unlocked it with her facial recognition. This time, something in her eyes changed. She begged me not to go through it. It was a good effort, but not good enough. I love you. And if you were a mother, you'd do the same thing. I then walked into my room and locked the door. There wasn't anything too bad. I did find what people call thirst traps on her TikTok, but her account was private and her following was mostly girls. The worrying part was her Instagram. There were bikini pictures plastered everywhere with extremely intimate songs and angles.

Jokes on you, I'll sit here till the end of time. It was the late 90s. I was still drowning in flannel and keeping up my lifelong habit of hoarding library books way past their due date. I had a paper to write for my sophomore global studies class, so, of course, I checked out more books than I could possibly get through, wrote the essay, then totally forgot about the stack gathering dust in the corner of my room. After a steady stream of overdue notices showing up in my homeroom, I finally returned the four or five books one sunny afternoon via the anonymous drop box during a study hall, then promptly moved on to bigger and better things. About two weeks later, I was called down to the assistant principal's office. In that space of time before classes officially started that was reserved for one thing and one thing only. The reprobates and delinquents were in trouble. I walked the halls thinking that surely this was just a timing mishap, and I was being summoned to receive congratulations for some kind of award I didn't know I had entered into competition for. Yep, he just wants to prepare me for the surprise ticker tape parade. I was wholly unprepared to hear that I was receiving lunch detention to start immediately, because I had not returned a single book that I still remember was slim and had a white and red cover from My G S. Paper research. I tried to argue that there was a mistake, since I was sure, like I am sure that I have fingertips, I had returned it, but he could not be moved, and I was sentenced to indefinite lunch detention until I either return the book or paid the 16 bucks to replace it. I left the office late for first period, defeated, but kept my head held high at lunch later that day, as I walked past the entirety of the cafeteria, which held a couple hundred of my peers, plastic food tray in hand, I went down the hall to the old shop classroom that had since been moved and the awaiting detention. I checked in with missus brown at her desk in front and took an inconspicuous seat in the back, staring down at my canned peach slices. I braced for the worst. A murderous ruckus was going to break out any minute, I could tell. But once my ears stopped ringing, I discovered that it was really a calm escape from the crowded and rowdy.

Here, let me show you something. I'm driving to work a few months ago. Almost there. Two turns left, maybe half a mile total. Just neighborhood streets, nothing fancy. This guy in a black BMW crawls up my ass and stays there. I can see him in my mirror, phone in one hand, making these angry faces at me like I personally ruined his morning. I speed up a bit. 5 over the limit. He gets closer. Now he's maybe two feet from my bumper, still checking his phone every few seconds. Real genius move there, buddy. Anyway, I take the first turn, and now I'm on the street where my building is probably about 600 yards ahead. The assholes still tailing me, riding just inches from my bumper, and clearly pissed that I'm still sticking to the speed limit. Maybe around 35 on this stretch. So I press the gas a bit and sure enough, he matches my speed. I drive an 8 year old Toyota truck. Not huge, not tiny, just a regular truck that's seen some shit. All terrain tires, decent suspension, and I've definitely treated it like a truck should be treated. Pastures, rocks, curbs. My baby's been through it all. So as I'm getting closer to my building, there's this big speed bump in the road meant to slow people down before they reach the parking garage entrances. I plants back and yep, assholes still glued to my bumper. I remember thinking, I've got to ease up for this speed bump, and then thinking again, if I hit the brakes, this guy's gonna plow right into me. That's when the plan starts to form in my head. And I hit the gas. I'm going about 45 when I hit that speed bump and Yeehaw! Caught a little air and came down hard. Never even touched the brakes. Didn't tap him once. Gave him absolutely no heads up for what was coming. I'm locked on my rearview mirror through the whole thing cause I wanted to catch his reaction. He's got his phone.

After what I saw today, I'm quitting my job for good. Most people think YouTube is just a website to watch cat videos or makeup tutorials, but behind closed doors, there are thousands of disturbing videos that never make the homepage. It's my job to make sure it stays that way. You would think after watching thousands of these gruesome videos, I would build some type of tolerance. But after what I just saw on a random channel, I'm convinced that I'm gonna die soon. The channel was called marbles, and it didn't have a profile picture or bio, but what it did have were four videos with creepy titles and weird thumbnails. When I first saw the videos, I couldn't make out what the thumbnails were because the images were too pixelated. Thought it'd just be another person uploading abuse videos or someone making staged content to shock people, but I was dead wrong. The first video was titled doggy, and all it showed was just footage of a sleeping dog. No violence, no audio, and literally nothing. I watched it five times to see what the problem was, but I couldn't find anything, so I reinstated the video and moved on to the next one. But that's when things got creepier, because this video was titled six PM and it showed a man walking through a forest. His breathing was off and the camera was shaky, but then out Of nowhere, the video cut to him standing still while he wore a mask and stared down at the camera. His eyes didn't blink, and it felt like he was staring straight into my soul. The third video was called clouds, and this time the camera was pointed down while someone was lying on the ground with their legs cut off. He was screaming in pain for the first 30 seconds, but just when I thought I saw it all, he stopped screaming completely, looked directly at the camera, and whispered something before the video went black. I couldn't tell what he said because he was too quiet, but that didn't matter. The video clearly violated the terms of service, so I immediately removed the video and decided to watch the last one. The fourth video was called Bad Day, and this time the first three minutes were just footage of a blank white wall. I thought it would be a repeat of the first video where nothing happened, but right as I was about to click off the same.

I'm now convinced I'm going to be dead tomorrow. I was just eating pizza a few nights ago when out of nowhere I got an email replying to my audio technician job listing on Craigslist. I was super excited to finally have some interest in my work, but when I saw that the pay was $100,000 for just three days of work, I was a bit skeptical. I thought this was just a fake email and was about to click off until I saw that there was an audio file attached underneath. We've listened to your samples and your sound processing skills are exactly what we're looking for. If you're interested in the job, please reply within 48 hours. Additionally, you will need to sign an NDA before you accept the position. After listening to the audio, I assumed I was just wrong about it being fake and decided I was willing to sign whatever I needed to. But the second I opened up the NDA to get some more details on the job, I found that one of the clauses said I would need to sign a waiver with a fine print saying that I might die. I had a bad feeling about it, but I only had 80 cents to my name and needed the money, so I signed it anyway. The moment I finished, I got an email from the company with an address under the text Come to this location tomorrow at 8:00am to start working with us. I didn't think much of it and went to sleep. When I woke up the next day, I put on a suit, wear my brand new Cologne, and started driving over to the location. But when I pulled into the parking lot, I knew something was off because there were no signs, no windows, and the location looked almost deserted. I figured I was probably just early, but the second I stepped inside the building, a super weird woman called Elizabeth came up to me, put me inside a creepy room, and said, you'll soon understand why we had you sign that death waiver. Was already regretting coming here, but it was too late. After a couple minutes passed by, she introduced me to this guy called Darren, who looked like he hadn't slept in like 20 years. Before I could even ask what the hell I was supposed to do, Darren pointed to a weird black box in the corner with a speaker and keyboard attached to it. That device can hear the dead. I immediately started laughing in his face and even glanced around for cameras, hoping all of this was just a

You name it, she's gonna be late for it. It drives me absolutely insane. The worst part is how she acts about it like it's no big deal. She'll roll her eyes when I tell her we need to leave, say, relax, babe, we have time when we absolutely don't, and then get mad at me for being stressed about it.

Her favorite singer was doing this acoustic set at a tiny venue. Downtown. She'd been refreshing the ticket page for weeks trying to get seats, and somehow managed to snag two tickets when someone canceled last minute. She was beyond excited, posting about it on Instagram every day, telling everyone at work about it. The show was at 8 p m. On a Saturday. The venue was small.

There are lines in life you don't cross. And when you do, you don't just break the law. You break people. For me, that line was drawn the day my sister's case went to court. She had been through hell, hurt in a way I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. She did everything right. Reported, gave statements, endured interviews, sat across from lawyers who asked her the most degrading questions you can imagine. She just wanted justice, um, recognition that what had been done to her mattered. I sat behind her in the courtroom, wearing the same suit I used for every hearing, notebook in hand. Not as a detective that day. Just a brother. Her attacker sat across the room, smug, relaxed, like he was at a casual lunch. Instead of facing charges for what he'd done. I kept staring at his hands, remembering how they'd shaken during questioning when I'd first confronted him off duty. That moment when you know someone's guilty, but they still think they can worm their way out. The trial wasn't long. Evidence lined up, witnesses were ready. The DA was confident. But when the judge walked in, I felt something I couldn't name. He wouldn't meet our eyes. Kept shuffling papers like he already hated being there. The DA made his opening statement clear and firm. Then came the defense, and it was pathetic. No alibi, no counterproof. Just character attacks and Cheap shots at my sister's credibility. But here's the thing. They didn't need a defense. Not when the judge himself was on their side. It started small. Objections overruled when they shouldn't have been. Evidence questioned that it had already been cleared for admissibility. The defense attorney practically smirking every time the judge leaned in their favor. Then the hammer blow. Halfway through testimony, my sister's voice trembling as she recounted the night everything changed, the judge actually cut her off. Said her words were too emotional to be considered reliable. He struck her testimony from the record. I felt my blood pressure spike. My fist clenched so tight, my nails dug into my palms. I wanted to shout.

I just finished the worst shift of my life. 12 hours at the hospital, two cardiac arrests, one patient we couldn't save. My scrubs were still damp with sweat when I walked into Murphy's Diner at 2 in the morning. This place was my sanctuary after brutal shifts. Same booth in the corner, same hot chocolate with extra whipped cream. Same ritual of decompressing until my hands stopped shaking. The diner was dead quiet. Just me, the night cook, Larry, flipping eggs, one server named Beth reading a magazine, and two truckers arguing about gas prices up front. Perfect. I slid into my usual booth and ordered my drink. Twenty minutes later, this guy in an expensive suit walks in with his teenage daughter. Designer, everything shiny. Watch, the whole deal. The kind of guy who probably never worked a day shift in his life. I'm scrolling through my phone when I hear footsteps approaching. Excuse me, he says, standing right next to my table. You're sitting in our booth? I look up, confused. Sorry, this is our reserved booth. We need you to move. I glance around the empty diner. There's literally 12 other booths available. There's no reservation system here. It's a 24 hour diner. He waves at Beth behind the counter. Tell her we have this booth reserved. Poor Beth looks mortified. Sir, I just said you could ask if it was available. I Can't make customers leave. The guy turns back to me with this fake sympathetic expression. Look, can't you just be decent about this? It's my daughter's birthday. We've sat in this exact booth every year since her mother passed away. She died last spring from cancer. I pause. The girl is clutching a small balloon and looking uncomfortable. My heart softens for a second. Then he adds, besides, you've clearly been sitting here long enough. That did it. The fake concern

I own a small cafe in a college town. Not a chain, not fancy, just a cozy spot with good coffee, fresh pastries, and regulars I'll have their order started before they even reach the counter. Business was steady. Not booming, but enough to pay my barista as well and keep the lights on. Then out of nowhere, we started getting one star reviews. Not just any bad reviews. These were daily, always posted in the early morning, always detailed, and always personal. Coffee was lukewarm and the owner rolled her eyes when I asked for milk. The croissants are clearly frozen, not fresh baked. Owner talks too much to customers, slows down the line. None of it was true. We bake pastries at 4:00am every morning. My espresso machine hits 200 degrees like clockwork. And if I do talk to customers, it's because they're usually happy about it. I brushed off the first few, even replied politely offering to make things right. But they kept coming and they got nastier. She's rude, unprofessional, and probably microwaves the muffins. The weirdest part, the reviewer names were always different. The writing style was identical. Overly specific complaints, same sentence structure, same weird phrasing. Like coffee lacked robust notes. My rating dropped from 4.8 to 4.1 in under a month. In the cafe world, that's deadly. People really do skip over you for the place next door. If Your stars are lower. That's when I started digging. I created a fake Google account and responded to one of the fake reviews pretending to agree, just to see what would happen. Within an hour I got a private message from another customer account saying you should try Roast House instead. Much better coffee and service. This house, the other cafe three blocks away. My so called competition. I did a little late night social media stalking, scrolling through their tagged photos. That's when I saw him. Kevin the owner. Smug smile, designer apron.

But there I was last year, staring at a cart full of groceries I couldn't afford, while my 17 year old daughter, Anna, pretended not to notice the cashier's annoyed sigh. We'd been struggling since I lost my marketing job during the pandemic. Those unemployment checks barely covered rent, let alone everything else. Kept telling Anna everything would be fine, that I'd figure it out, but honestly, I was drowning. We started turning off heat in rooms we weren't using. I'd eat a sleeve of crackers for dinner and tell Anna I wasn't hungry. The pink envelope from the bank came on a Tuesday. Final notice. 30 days to pay or lose the house. I opened it in the kitchen and just collapsed right there on the linoleum floor, sobbing like a kid. I thought Anna was at school, but she'd come home early because she forgot her textbook. She found me there with that letter in my hands, hyperventilating. Mom, what's wrong? I tried to hide it, but she grabbed the paper and read it. Her face went completely white. How much do we owe? I couldn't even look at her. 43,000 back payments fee. He's everything. The next morning, Anna wasn't in her bed. Her backpack was gone, but her school clothes were still hanging in her closet. I called Her phone, like 20 times. Nothing. I was about to call the police when she finally texted back around noon. I'm fine at work. Talk tonight. Work. She worked part time at the grocery store on weekends. Maybe 15 hours total. What was she doing there on a Wednesday? When she came home that evening, she had this look on her face. Determined, but scared. Like she'd made a huge decision and wasn't sure if it was right. She sat me down at our kitchen

I run a barbecue food truck, and let me tell you, street vending is like the Wild West. No matter how good your brisket is, you're always one bad inspection away from losing everything. There's this one corner downtown that's gold. Heavy foot traffic, office workers at lunch, weekend festivals, you name it. The city only allows one truck there at a time, and you have to book it through their online permit system months in advance. It's first come, first served, and if you miss your day, too bad, you can't just swap in another truck without city approval. So I book my Friday slot three months ahead. I'm there early, set up smoker going, the works. Around 11 a m, another food truck rolls up. Bright neon paint job, giant Cartoon Taco plastered on the side. It's Taco titan, run by a guy named Vince. Vince jumps out in sunglasses and a leather jacket because apparently he's auditioning for Food Network's Douchebags in the wild. I'm taking this spot today. He says like it's a done deal. I laugh, thinking he's joking. Uh, no. I've got the permit. You can check with the city. He smirks. Oh, I don't need to check. See, your truck's a Dinosaur. I'm bringing in something fresh, Instagram worthy. People want tacos? Cool. I say you can give them tacos somewhere you're actually booked. Then he drops it. I've been parking here for Years without a permit. They never check. And you know what? If you call the city, I'll just tell them you invited me. Now, I'm a reasonable guy, but this is my living. My smoker takes four hours to get to 10. Moving is not an option. So I tell him straight, if you park here without a permit, that's on you. He parks anyway, right in front of my truck, like, literally blocking half my signage. At first I'm pissed, but then I remember something. Fridays are when the city inspector does his random rounds downtown. They check permits, sanitation and fire safety. And the inspector, he's a no BS kind.

My mom had died three months before from diabetes complications because we couldn't afford her insulin consistently. I was living with my aunt, who worked double shifts at a gas station just to keep our tiny apartment. These houses I cleaned were insane. Like bathrooms bigger than our entire place, with marble everything. And those fancy toilets that cost more than my aunt made in six months. I'd scrub these pristine kitchens that probably got used twice during their whole vacation. One Thursday afternoon, I was mopping the hallway in this ridiculous mansion when I heard screaming from upstairs.

She already had the newest model, but apparently she needed a separate one for content creation. I tried to keep working, but then I heard her yell something that made my blood freeze. She screamed at her dad, if you're gonna be so annoying about money, why don't you just divorce mom and marry someone richer instead? I gripped that mop handle so tight, my knuckles went white. My mom had died on the same couch I slept on every night. We'd eaten ramen for Dinner probably 300 days that year. See, Sienna stormed out of the room and saw me standing there in the hallway. She rolled her eyes and said, uh, I hate when the help just stands around doing nothing. I wanted to say something, but I needed this job desperately, so I just kept mopping and pretended I didn't hear anything.

My daughter Rosie was six when she started limping around the house. At first I thought maybe she twisted her ankle at the playground or something. Kids are always falling and getting bruised up, right? But then she started crying about her legs hurting, especially at night. She'd wake me up at 2:00am, sobbing that her bones felt like they were on fire. I'd give her some children's Tylenol and rub her legs until she fell back asleep. This. This went on for about a week before I decided to take her to our pediatrician. Doctor Mitchell had been our family doctor for three years. He was this older guy who always seemed rushed, like he had somewhere more important to be. When I brought Rosie in, he barely looked at her for five minutes before giving his diagnosis. Well, she's carrying some extra weight, he said, looking at her chart. Kids her age should be running around more. Put her on a diet and try getting her outside more often. The leg pain is probably just from the extra strain. I stared at him. Sure, Rosie was a little chubby, but she was active. She rode her bike every day and loved playing at the park. But Doctor Mitchell was already writing something in her file and moving toward the door. But she's crying in pain every night, I said. She can barely Walk some mornings. He turned back with this annoyed look. Kids exaggerate. She's probably trying to get attention or avoid school. Just stick to the diet plan. I left feeling confused, but figured maybe he knew something I didn't. So I started packing healthier lunches for Rosie and taking her to the park every single day after school. But nothing changed. If anything, she got worse. Two weeks later, Rosie couldn't even get out of bed without help. Her little face was so pale, and she kept saying her legs felt heavy.

Now my he wants my house. When I was 16, my gaming obsessed brother Tyler convinced my parents I was taking up too much space in our cramped three bedroom apartment. He'd been complaining for months that he needed my room for his elaborate gaming setup. My parents sat me down one evening and basically said I had two weeks to find alternative living arrangements. The reasoning? I was almost 17, practically an adult, and Tyler needed space to pursue his passion in gaming. And they genuinely believed he was going to become the next big Twitch star. I was devastated, but had nowhere to go. My girlfriend Emma's parents noticed I've been spending more time at their house and eventually asked what was going on. When I explained the situation, her mom immediately said I could stay with them as long as I needed, no questions asked. Emma and I got serious fast. Living under the same roof will do that to a relationship. When we turned 19, I proposed with a ring. I'd saved six months for working overtime every weekend. Her parents were thrilled. They basically raised me for two years anyway and considered me their son. At 23, we finally had enough saved for a down payment on a small two bedroom house. Nothing fancy. We spent every weekend renovating, learning YouTube tutorials, making mistakes and fixing them. Meanwhile, Tyler was still living with my parents in his gaming paradise. He dropped out of community college after one semester, claiming his streaming career was about to take off and college was just holding him back. Three years later, he was still grinding away at maybe five viewers on a good day, sleeping until two PM, gaming until 4:00am, ordering Doordash.

The kid can roast me in Mario Kart and crack one liners that make my mom choke on her coffee. This year, all he wanted for his birthday was to go to the big shopping mall downtown. The one with the massive food court, arcade, and the store that sells those custom sneakers he's obsessed with. We've been planning it for weeks, saved up to buy him a pair. Mom took the day off work. Even the weather seemed like it was cooperating. We got there around noon, Ethan in his wheelchair with a brand new Marvel hoodie, beaming like it was Christmas morning. He spotted a balloon stand near the entrance, and the vendor tied one to the armrest of his chair. It floated above him like a little red exclamation Mark. We spent the first hour just browsing, Ethan pointing out things he wanted to totally buy when he's rich, me joking that he'd better remember his big brother when that happened. Eventually, we headed to the sneaker store. Ethan had been talking about this moment for months. He rolled right up to the display, ran his hand over the shoes, and looked at me like, is this real life? That's When it happened, out of nowhere, this guy in a mall manager badge strides over. Tall, late 40s, perfect hair, gel helmet. He stops a few feet from us and says loudly, sir, you can't just roll in here and block the displays. I thought he was joking. Ethan was completely in the clear, nowhere near blocking anyone. I said, he's just looking at the shoes. The manager gives me this fake customer service smile and says, I understand, but maybe you could take him somewhere more suitable. We don't want accidents. I felt my stomach drop. Ethan smile vanished. People around us turned to look. My mom froze midstep, gripping the handles of Ethan's chair. The manager laughed, an actual chuckle, and added, besides, this is a busy store. Someone might trip over him. Trip over him? Like my brother was an obstacle? Ethan's

I was marinating ribs at 6:00am when Lexi texted me. You're uninvited. We don't want you there. No explanation, just a cold dismissal from the person who never lifted a finger for these reunions. For eight years, I've been the backbone of every family gathering. I brought the smoker, bought all the alcohol, coordinated everything. Lexi just showed up and took credit while I did the actual work. She waltzed in wearing some designer dress, pose for photos, and act like she organized everything while I was sweating over a hot grill. I stared at that text, hands covered in marinade, and typed back, fine, I'm taking my barbecue and drinks with me. An hour later, my phone explode. 15 missed calls from cousins, uncles, everyone panicking. Wait, you're not coming? What about the food? Lexi said you bailed on us. My voicemail was completely full. Text after text rolled in. Please tell me you're joking. The reunion won't be the same without your brisket. What happened? That's when I realized Lexi's fatal mistake. She never told them she uninvited me. She just announced I canceled and left them scrambling with no backup plan. Classic Lexi, creating problems and expecting everyone else to solve them. I texted my cousin Matthew. Lexi invited me, but you're welcome at my place. I've got everything we need. Matthew immediately called back. Absolutely furious. She did what? That's completely insane. I'm coming over and bringing everyone I can convince. Within minutes, half the family was choosing my backyard over Lexi's. Faster. Even the neighbors wanted in. When word spread about the impromptu cookout happening on my street, my phone kept buzzing with acceptances. Uncle Hank, on my way with the cornhole boards and my famous hot sauce. Cousin Liz bringing my potato.

Well, I wake up at about 1:00am in a dark bedroom and see the black silhouette of a young kid standing right next to the bed. Golly, that's scary. Then he asked, hey, dad, Wanna play Rock Band 2? Waking up to my husband yelling, get out of my house. A man broke into my house and crawled in bed with me. Turns out he was in the house for a couple of hours. According to my door camera, my husband was asleep on the couch, came to bed and found the guy on the bed beside me asleep. Also, I accidentally left my door unlocked when I lived in this studio apartment in Philly. I woke up and it felt like someone was watching me. You know that feeling. Then I heard a shuffling noise and turn the lights on. There was a guy in a hoodie standing at the foot of my bed. I screamed. It was a young drunk dude that I literally had to push out. He seemed confused, but I'll never know what his intent was. I've never left my door unlocked since 3. Once I woke up to go to the bathroom, got up, smack something, slap me in The face. Turns out it was my entire right arm. Completely numb. Nearly scared the piss out of me and concerned me greatly afterwards. Has not happened since. 4. Back when I lived alone in an apartment, I used to wake up to just about anything. Never woke up more terrified than the night when I woke up to the sound of my toilet flushing. To this day, I can only assume that a ghost just couldn't hold it anymore. Five, I woke up and my dad's alarm clock was going off through the wall. He was a really light sleeper and he always turned it off immediately. It had been going off for several minutes and I think I knew before I got to his room that he was no longer with me. It was just so incredibly out of character for that alarm to be going off like that. He went in his sleep with a blanket still completely undisturbed. And I think I felt some small comfort at that, even though I was just a kid. 6, I once woke up to an earthquake at 4:00am. I lived in a house over the ocean on stilts, so my house was rocking like crazy. It was my first earthquake. And for some reason my brain first thought that someone was robbing me. I grabbed a machete and ran outside shirtless in my underwear. Neighbors next to me looked at me alarmed and started laughing. 7, my partner waking. Me up during a camping trip. He woke me to gather all our gear and our dogs into our truck ASAP. Lightning we had spotted six hours earlier in the day had sparked a wildfire. We got out as ash and sparks were falling around us. When we reached the top of the ridge surrounding our camp, we got out to look and watch the fire eat our entire campsite. We're so glad we called in the strike when we saw it. We met fire crews on our way out. The fire burned for like a week. One of the fires in Oregon in 2020, the Lakeview Paisley Fire 8, a bed bug infestation. I had had them for weeks and had no idea what they were. I would see one or two here or there and I'd just squash them, wonder what they were and move on. One morning, I woke up early and found quite a few of them on my bed. I started looking more closely and realised that the creases of the mattress were infested with them. Then I started to do some research, Learned that I had bed bugs, felt my soul leave my body, then began the process of getting rid of them. They're a psychological horror experience I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy. Five years after the fact, and I still get paranoia attacks at a random speck in the sheets or mysterious red marks in the morning.

What was the rest of the date like? One, first date from a dating app. We went for beverages at a hotel spot restaurant. When we were ordering the beverages, she said to the bartender, you can serve the restaurant menu here, right? I'll have the end. Proceeded to name the expensive dish she already knew by name. That was the there will be no second date red flag. The plan wasn't dinner, was a drink. Originally she had suggested an expensive restaurant, but I'd said let's just have a drink the first time, clearly just a foodie call. The I'm leaving now red flag was that she got on the phone and texted for a while, then said, my friends are coming to meet us. Let's order some more appetizers and a bottle. That was when I said the plan was some beverages to get to know each other, not be the wallet for your friends night out. I'll cover these beverages, have fun with your friends and left to pay my part of the Bill. Two, we matched on a dating app and he kept messaging me persistently, but he seemed like a nice guy. So he picked me up and took me to a decent sushi place. The actual dinner part went fine. Aside from him being very nervous and visibly sweating as he drove me home, he continually professed his love for me. By the time We got to my building. I was ready to book it as fast as possible into the entrance door which would lock behind me and he would be unable to enter without a key. Balked immediately. 3. An immediate red flag was that she told me she had no money and then she ordered the most expensive beverage on the list halfway through the date. She said she came from her ex boyfriend's house, but not to worry, they were no longer together. I finished my drink and excused myself to the bathroom. I tracked down our waitress and paid for our beverages. When I returned to the table, I told her I didn't think this was going to work out and left. Four, guy admitted to being technically homeless and crashing in a studio with two other guys. Told me he'd had 13 injuries that may have LED to memory loss. He didn't believe in key rings so he kept his keys on a rope, farted on a cat. I could go on. So much happened and all of it was unhinged. He got up to go to the bathroom and in a moment of inspiration and panic, I suddenly gained self awareness and realized I could leave. I threw money down on the bar top, made sympathetic eye contact with the bartender who had been watching the train wreck go down and then sprinted out of the restaurant. 5, she wanted to order lobster. I said, waiter, separate Bills, please. She glared at me, calling me broke while making the face. I ate my cheeseburger and fries and left her alone. Talk about spoiled. 6. We were having a very nice time, good chat, good company, etcetera. I looked over my shoulder to see the decor of the place we were in and she said, excuse me, I'm over here. She didn't like me not making eye contact all the time. If I looked away, she was insulted. The date ended and I drove away. 7, blind date, friend of a friend. He did not stop talking the entire time, didn't ask me one question. I just sat there mentally playing my favorite songs in my head until the Bill came. Because I'm a nice person and thought he might be nervous, I gave him another chance. The same thing happened over the phone. I fell asleep for 15 minutes and when I woke up, he was still talking. We did not meet up again. 8. She had never seen Star Wars. I'm not a fan. I don't even really like Star Wars. She brought up in conversation, complaining that her brother had become obsessed with the Star War. And that was it the whole rest of the date. Inside my head I asked myself, but how could she not know the name? Surely she's heard other people say it. Her brother has a lot of merch. She's read it many times. She doesn't have to care about It, but like, how is it even possible?

One first time I took a hot shower in our new home, the steam covered the mirror only to reveal the phrase, hello, I see you in large finger drawn writing. It freaked me out for a second but made me laugh soon after that. It was such an inconspicuous yet obvious thing to leave for the new homeowner. Me. Two, wasn't a purchase, but I was showing a house to a couple and we couldn't believe the reported square footage. It looked like a nice 1,700 square foot house in a semi rural community, but the square footage on the listing said about 4,500. I was sure it was a typo. Turns out most of it was in the basement. Think Buffalo Bills basement. That just goes on and on with random rooms. The place was vacant. The lighting wasn't great. We got to a dead end room down there and turned on the lights and there was this porcelain doll just chilling in the middle of the room. Only thing left in the house. Husband yells, screw this, and we all run out. We ruled out that whole neighborhood as an option for obvious reasons. 3, $1,200 in cash above the door on the inside of the closet. I found it while painting. 4, we bought a house being foreclosed on. We gave him an extra month after closing in. 2000 to help with his move. Still had to have the sheriff come to remove him. Anywho, I was doing some clean up and remodeling before we moved in. The whole house was carpeted. When I started ripping it out, there was a giant blood stain that started in a downstairs spare bedroom and then trailed up to the master bath where there was another stain. His wife had left him. So I had to call the realtor to find out if anyone knew where she was. Turns out he had taken out a deer in the yard and gutted it in the house. What a hassle. Had to rip up and install new sub floors. My vegan ex wife was not thrilled. 5. The property my wife and I moved to three years ago had a bucket full of wrapped Dinosaur bones. Took them to our local museum where they confirm they are roughly 68 million years old. Hadrosaur. Pretty cool. 6. We bought the house from the CEO of the company which we franchise from. It was her childhood home where her mother lived until the day she passed. In true rich person fashion, they didn't care to clean out the house before selling it. They just told us we can do whatever we want with the old lady stuff that was there. We found a hidden box of spicy letters from the old lady to her secret partner spanning many years. That was fun to give to the CEO 7, my uncle was renovating the house that he bought for his chiropractic practice. And when he knocked down a wall to enlarge a room, a few dozen pill bottles fell to the floor. They were each filled with about 25 US silver dollars, which at the time were worth more like $6 in silver each. So it was about $5,000 in vintage coins. 8, that they wired a room by connecting the outlet with an extension cord inside the wall. 9, a diary of an American soldier in World War 2 South Pacific Theater found it above a door when remodeling 20+ years ago. My wife and I tried everything we could think of to find a descendant, but to no avail. Ten, a basement room that was fully decked out as a dungeon. Fake stone walls, a stocks like where you lock your head and hands in Old England. Candle scones on the walls, a metal barred cage in the corner from floor to ceiling. Oh, and the closet had a load of toys, some normal, some not so normal. 11, an entire tribe of raccoons living in the attic.

One. The grandma who used coconut oil on her granddaughter who was extremely allergic and passed from it. As someone who works with toddlers, that story is a nightmare. Grandma nonchalantly caused the passing of her granddaughter. Not because she didn't know about the allergy, because she just didn't think it was a big deal. And in no time flat, a toddler is gone and two parents and two surviving siblings are forever traumatized. And grandma can't figure out why her daughter won't see her two. It wasn't as memorable or as big as most Reddit comments, but one has stuck with me. I forgot what the question was, but this guy commented that he was asked to bring like two gallons of milk to his girlfriend's family dinner. He thought, oh, they must really like milk. When he arrived, each family member had their own gallon of milk, and when dinner was served they all just started guzzling their own milk like animals. I need to try finding that. It was hilarious. 3 the one where the guy had an imaginary girlfriend, later wife, who was a giant cockroach, and his coworkers eventually found out that he had a whole fantasy life with his life size cockroach girlfriend slash wife. Four people seem to regularly post what Reddit post can't you get over? And I always drop in to say the pregnant woman whose husband and father In law decided she'd pass in labor and we're doing all the planning for that to happen. She never updated and I always wonder and worry a little. Wish I'd save the post. 5 the guy who was looking for legal advice because his landlord was sneaking in and leaving him notes while he was sleeping and someone in the comment section saved his life by realizing he was actually suffering carbon monoxide poisoning. Six the lady on ADA who unplugged her fridge to deep clean it while her husband had a box in there who told her to not open the box. I frequently wonder what was in the box. 7 the dude that bought a house with his GF and wasn't allowed upstairs. I want an update to this more than any unsolved mystery. 8 the guy who caught his wife cheating thanks to his Dyson fan epic. 9 the guy who Rick rolled Rick Astley.

When I was in ninth grade, I got stuck with our school's worst teacher, who was infamous for trying to make a Muslim girl take off her headwear to prove she wasn't wearing headphones in class. There were a lot of students who got away with cheating by wearing headphones during tests, so she was constantly checking. Since then, she didn't do anything too bad until we had to take our final exam at the end of the year, and she stood up to walk around the room. It was really hot that day, so I wore a lighter shirt. I also happened to have type 1 diabetes, so you could see my insulin pump. That day, my blood sugar was low, so I turned my pump on and walked into class. We were almost done taking the test, and she stood up to walk around the room. I was honestly focused on just passing until I heard her walk straight up behind me. In that moment, two things happened. She grabbed my paper off my desk and told me I failed, and I felt her grab the pump on my waist. I just sat there in shock as she walked away and had no idea what had just happened. However, it wasn't until I noticed she was holding Scissors that it clicked what she had just done. She seen the wire hanging off My waist and assumed I had headphones in. When I looked down, the tube was cut. After a few seconds, my pump started beeping very loudly and everyone started looking at me. A few people sitting around me saw what happened and were in shock. She came over and when she realized what she did, I watched her face turn pale. She had messed up big time and had no idea what to do, and neither did I. She told me to go to the nurse, and on the way there, I started getting. I made it there. Could feel myself starting to pass out. The nurse called 9 1 1 and I had to go to the hospital. But since that day, I actually started wearing headphones in class because none of the teachers would try anything.

When my son was in the third grade, he was a bully. We tried everything, but he kept constantly getting in trouble and sent to the office. He was known throughout the school for tying balloons to the class rabbit and almost letting it float away. I was leaving work to go get him and as my phone rang, I already knew who it was. I had a special ringtone for his teacher because she called me so much just so I could prepare to hear what he did. She was crying when I answered and I knew it was bad. I told her I was on the way, but instead of getting upset, she started to thank me. I was really confused and she started to talk about what a sweet boy I raised. Literally nobody had ever told me that before. And I asked what happened. Apparently another kid who didn't have a lot of friends was in his class and his mom had handed out birthday invitations to everyone the day before. Right before the bell went off, he stood up in front of everyone and asked who was coming to his party. Entire class was now silent and he just stood there looking around for someone to tell him they were going. Nobody was saying anything and she said she could see the kids heart literally breaking in real time. Then as he went to sit back down in shame, my son stood up and said, I'm gonna come. I'll be there. His face lit up, and one by one all the other boys in the class followed his lead and also started telling him they'd come, too. He was trying not to cry when we showed up that weekend.

I remember sitting in math when the bell rang, and I started walking towards the library to eat lunch. I was starving. There was nowhere to sit except the very back. As soon as I sat down, I remember hearing a sound from the hallway that sounded like a door slamming onto the ground. Nobody really reacted, but then we heard a girl screaming outside the library. She came running down the hallway, and we heard the noise again. It was so silent in there until she yelled, somebody help! He has a gun! And everyone completely panicked. I remember freezing up because I didn't know where to go. The room was all windows, and everyone started flooding out the back door. I move, and another guy went to hide in a utility closet behind us. He told me to come inside, so I did. We sat there silently crying for about five minutes, slugging our ears. It felt like hours. And everyone screaming was gone. It was so quiet. So we opened the window on the door slightly to see out. As soon as I did, I saw they were inside the library. We stayed as silent as we possibly could, and my mom wouldn't stop texting me. We couldn't move, but I realized if my mom calls me, my phone would go off. If she called me, we probably wouldn't survive. We sat there with our Hands over our mouths, trying to breathe as quietly as we could. And I was praying they wouldn't look inside. We could hear them right outside the closet we were in. But they started running out, and we heard the police in the school. We sat there for another hour until the police found us. And we made it out safe. When I asked my mom why she didn't call me, she said she didn't want it to ring in case I might be hiding

My wife, Stephanie, waited until we were eating dessert at Cassie and Paul's house to drop this on me. We should swap partners every Thursday, she said. And I literally watched her put her hand on Paul's thigh under the table. I saw it. Cassie saw it, too, and her face went blank. What? I asked? Because I honestly thought I heard her wrong. Partner swapping? We date each other's spouses. She said it like she was talking about switching cars for the weekend. Paul kept staring at his plate and wouldn't make eye contact with me. It's already decided, Stephanie said. Thursday nights, you take Cassie out, Paul takes me. I felt my chest get tight. When did they decide this without me? This is insane, I told her. Then she leaned in close and whispered. Room 2:37 last Tuesday when you were at work. My whole body went numb. She was telling me she'd already cheated and now wanted my permission to keep doing it. So are you in or not? She asked louder. I looked at Cassie and she was crying without making any sound. Fine, I said, let's swap partners. Stephanie smiled like she just won something. But then I noticed Cassie had stopped crying completely. That should have told me something right there. When the first date night came around, Stephanie spent forever getting ready. Put on this red Dress I've never seen before, that she'd been hiding in our closet. Paul's car was already running in our driveway when I left. I brought Cassie white roses because I remembered she mentioned liking them once. Her hands shook when she took them. Paul never. She started, then stopped at dinner. She pushed her food around and barely ate anything. You okay? I asked. Paul's been different, she said quietly, for months, even before. Then she stopped talking again. I reached over and touched her hand before. What? Nothing. Forget I said anything. But then her phone lit up with Stephanie's name and she turned it face down. Immediately I got home that night, Stephanie was already there. Her hair was all messed up and her lipstick was smeared on the wrong side of her mouth. How was Cassie? Good. How was Paul? Then she started telling me everything they did, the hotel room, the balcony, what they did against the wall. She kept getting louder with each detail. Stop, I told her. Why? Don't you wanna know? No, her face got all twisted up. Well, I'm telling you anyway. She kept going with more details while I pulled out my phone and texted Cassie, thank you for a lovely evening. Stephanie saw my screen and threw her wine glass at the wall. It shattered everywhere and I just stood there looking at her. The next week, I had to pick Cassie up because her car broke down out of Nowhere. Paul was supposed to drive me, she said, looking confused. I forgot at dinner she had way too much wine. Can I tell you something? She asked. And her eyes looked glassy. Tuesday afternoons, that's when it started. My heart started racing. What started? She covered her mouth with her hand. Nothing. Forget it. But Tuesday was when Stephanie had mentioned the hotel and we both knew what she meant. Then we had to go to Stephanie's parents'house for dinner. Stephanie showed up late and I could smell Paul's Cologne all over her clothes. Her mom.

She returned 6 years later to find I divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years Max. Don't change the locks. She left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation to our 8 year olds. That first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parent decisions. No more walking on eggshells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curve ball our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year 2 brought unexpected changes without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I've been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd forgotten how to Enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her Bonus Mom, their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes and tucked them in at night. Year 5 was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. Their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year 6, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward after three years of Zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from the living.

Two women in our accounting department got pregnant at almost the exact same time. Jessica found out first and was super excited, showing everyone her ultrasound photos and talking about baby names during lunch breaks. Three weeks later, Amber announced she was also pregnant, due just two weeks after Jessica. Everyone was thrilled. The whole office was buzzing about having two babies so close together. Both women submitted their maternity leave paperwork right away, since we needed time to arrange coverage for their positions. Jessica went on leave first. When her daughter was born, everything seemed normal. Then Amber went into labour early, about a week before her scheduled leave was supposed to start. That's when things got weird. Our payroll system flagged an error. When I tried to process Amber's leave, it said someone had already filed maternity leave under her name and Social Security number. I figured it was just a computer glitch, so I called our IT department. They pulled up the records and found something impossible. According to our system, Amber had already been on maternity leave for three weeks. But she'd been working the whole time. She was literally at her desk yesterday. I started digging deeper and found the original leave request filed under Amber's name. It had her Social Security number, her employee ID, everything. But the submission date was from a month ago, right when Jessica Had filed hers. Something was seriously wrong here. I pulled the security footage from the day the duplicate paperwork was submitted. At 6:47 p m, after most people had left, Jessica was sitting at Amber's desk, using her computer. She spent 43 minutes there printing documents and filling out forms. But it got worse. Way worse.

I nearly choked on my cereal because that was not a conversation I wanted to have at 8:00am on a Tuesday. It's not what it looks like, I said quickly. But Jake was already scrolling through my transaction history with his eyebrows raised. Really? Because it looks like you're getting paid every Friday for the past three months by someone whose contact name is literally Sugar daddy Mike with money bag emojis. He turned his phone toward me showing the evidence. Are you seriously doing that kind of work? Without telling me, I grabbed my phone back, my face burning red. Jake, I swear to God it's not what you think. Mike is my boss at the pet sitting company. He stared at me like I'd grown a third leg. Your boss pays you through Venmo and you call him Sugar Daddy Mike? I realized how absolutely insane this sounded, but it was the truth. The company payroll system has been broken for months. Mike pays all the employees through Venmo. And I saved his contact as Sugar Daddy Mike as a joke because he's always buying us coffee and treats for the dogs. Jake was not buying this explanation at all. That's the most ridiculous cover story I've ever heard. Look, I'll prove it. I called Mike right there in our kitchen. He answered on the second ring with his Usual cheerful voice. Hey, and you're not scheduled until this afternoon. Everything okay? I put him on speaker. Mike, my boyfriend thinks we're having some kind of inappropriate relationship because of how you pay us and how your name shows up in my phone. Mike burst out laughing. Oh, no, not again. This happened with my daughter's boyfriend last month. He thought she was cheating on him with her sugar daddy Mike. He explained to Jake that his payroll company had been hacked six months ago, so he'd been paying everyone through cash apps. Jake still looked skeptical. But why Sugar Daddy Mike? Mike laughed even harder. Because I spoil my employees and the pets rotten. Free coffee every day, premium dog treats, bonuses for good work. The girls started calling me Sugar Daddy Mike because I'm always buying supplies and treating them like family. He invited Jake to come by the office to meet the team. You can meet the other four dog walkers who probably also have me saved as Sugar Daddy Mike in their phones. I could see Jake starting to believe the story, but he was still embarrassed about jumping to conclusion. This is why you should have just told me you had a job, he muttered. After we hung up with Mike, Jake apologized profusely. I should have just asked you directly instead of making assumptions. But then he got curious about other things. Wait, if you're only making $250 twice a month, how are You paying for all those expensive dinners you've getting delivered? My stomach dropped because I've been hoping he wouldn't notice my Doordash habit. That's a different situation, I said, trying to change the subject. But Jake was already connecting dots. Please tell me you're not actually doing sugar daddy stuff on the side to pay for food. I just waved it off and tried to ignore him for the rest of the day. The next day, I brought Jake to the pet sitting office to meet Mike and prove my story. He was exactly what you'd expect, 50 something guy in dog hair covered clothes who immediately offered us both coffee and dog treats to sample. See, he said to Jake, total sugar daddy behaviour but completely innocent. The other employees confirmed that they all had similar contact names for Mike and that he was basically the most generous boss ever. Last month he paid for my dog's vet Bill when I couldn't afford it, one co worker said. Jake felt terrible for assuming the worst and bought lunch for the whole pet sitting crew as an apology. I watched too much true crime, he explained to Mike. When I I saw those payments, my mind immediately went to the darkest possibility. Mike laughed it off and said it happened more often than you'd think. My wife gets suspicious, looks at the bank when she deposits checks made out to Sugar Daddy, Mike's Pet Care. That night, Jake finally relaxed. Convinced everything was fine. But when I checked my phone before bed, another 500 dollar transfer came in. The message read, good job. He bought every word.

You mean to tell me that someone was infected with the plague in 2025? Like, how do you even let that happen? This isn't a cold. This isn't allergies. This is the plague. That's the kind of word you should only read in a museum plaque. Not here on a Tuesday morning news update. And the way the news says it is always so casual. A rare case of the plague was reported this week. Rare, bro. Rare should mean never again. That's not supposed to be in circulation. That's like saying, oh, yeah, someone caught smallpox on their lunch break. They'll hit you with, don't worry, it's treatable now. Okay, cool. But imagine being the one person who goes to urgent care with a fever and the doctor walks in wearing a bird mask and carrying a bag of leeches. That's not medical attention. That's a medieval horror show. Like think about how cooked we are if the plague can just pop back up. We've got a I rockets to Mars and somehow we're still fighting the same disease that wiped out half of Europe. That's not progress. That's a rerun. Every headline feels less like news and more like a countdown. First, it was Covid tearing everything apart. Then wildfires turning skies orange. Now the plague shows up. Tell me this doesn't feel like end credits.

I'll be standing right there laughing with everyone and still feel like an extra in my own life. Like I'm the supporting character in their story, but never the main one in mine. And yeah, it hurts.

It started at Thanksgiving when my cousin wouldn't shut up about me being single. She kept asking why I never brought anyone home, making these fake concerned faces at the dinner table. So when she said, I must be dating someone special, I just nodded, gave him a name right on the spot. Daniel said he was busy with work. My family ate it up. But then Christmas rolled around and my mom started asking when she could meet Daniel. My aunt kept texting about setting an extra place at dinner. I was stuck. That's when my roommate Becca suggested her coworker, Daniel, who owed her big time for covering his shifts. He showed me his Instagram, tall brown hair, actually decent looking. He agreed to one dinner as a favor. The problem, he didn't just show up and fake smile through dinner. He brought flowers for my mom, asked my dad about his woodworking hobby and somehow knew my grandmother collected vintage tea cups because I'd mentioned it once when building the fake story. He even laughed at my little brother's terrible jokes about robots. My family was obsessed. After that first dinner, my mom kept inviting him back, Easter brunch, my cousin's graduation party, random Sunday dinners. Daniel never said no. He text me beforehand asking what to bring, if anyone had allergies, stuff like that. He started sending my brother updates about basketball. Scores. My dad asked him to help fix our back porch. The worst part was how natural it felt. We drive to my parents house together and he'd ask about my day like we actually dated, remembered my coffee order, knew I hated mushrooms, would grab my jacket when I got cold. During family game night, he'd automatically pick me as his partner. We had inside jokes that weren't even planned. One night after my aunt's birthday party, we sat in his car outside my apartment in complete silence. Everyone had spent the whole night saying how perfect we looked together, how lucky I was. My grandmother even pulled me aside to say Daniel was a keeper. The whole car ride home, I kept filling glances at him, wondering what he was thinking. I started rehearsing speeches in my bathroom mirror, practice bringing it up casually over coffee. But every time I opened my mouth, nothing came out. How do you tell someone you caught feelings for a fake relationship? Everything changed at Christmas dinner. My aunt announced she'd been looking at wedding venues for us, that she found the perfect place for next fall. Daniel laughed it off perfectly, made some joke about her getting ahead of herself. But later that night, he texted me, we can't keep this up forever. You know, that message hit me like a truck. I realized he was ready to end this whole thing and I wasn't, not even close. Instead of texting Back or giving him some weird speech. I invited him over for dinner at my place, cooked his favorite pasta dish, the one my mom always made when he came over the table with actual candles, not just the overhead light. After we finished eating, I was washing dishes and he was drying them, just like we did at my parents house. That's when I finally said it. I know this.

Should I tell her? After three months of her girls nights turning into therapy sessions about how marriage was just a trap, I was done fighting. She'd come home at two a m, reeking of wine, telling me about her divorced friends, authentic lives, how they were finally free and living their truth. Last week, she said maybe I should have listened when they warned me about settling down. So I stopped trying. Yesterday, she noticed. You're not fighting for us anymore. If you really loved me, you'd wanna fix this. I looked at her calmly. You want me to fight for our marriage? Yes. Obviously. Okay. I pulled out my phone and called her best friend, Janet. The twice divorced one who'd been coaching her. Hey, Janet, it's James. Quick question. Do you think my wife should stay married to someone she regrets being with? My wife's face went white. That's what I thought. Thanks for the honest advice. I hung up and looked at my wife. Janet says you should definitely leave me. Congratulations. Your advisor just made the decision for you. She started crying. That's not what I wanted. Funny, because three months ago you said Janet's advice was the best thing that ever happened to you. But I wasn't done. I called Crystal. Next one who spends weekends bar hopping, crying about how all men are trash. Crystal. Hey. My wife's been telling me about Your amazing single life. Should she join you? Live that authentic truth with you guys? Talk about through the phone? Crystal's voice got quiet. Well, I mean, maybe you two should work it out. Work it out? But you told her marriage was a prison last Tuesday. At least that's what she came home saying. I put the phone on speaker so my wife could hear Crystal backpedal. I was just venting about my own situation. I didn't mean. Oh, so when you said, dump his ass and live for yourself, you were just venting? Silence. Then I called Debbie, the twice divorced one living with her parents at 35. Debbie, great news. My wife's finally ready to take your advice about leaving me. When can she move in with you and your mom? Move in? I. There's not really room here. But you said independence was worth any sacrifice. My wife was pale, watching her support system crumble in real time. After I hung up, she whispered, they were just trying to help. Debbie's eating cereal for dinner because she can't afford groceries. Crystal hasn't had a second date in two years. Janet's on antidepressants because she's so lonely. You don't understand their situations. I understand perfectly. Three miserable women convinced you to throw away a good marriage so you could be miserable with them. She sat down hard, but they said I deserved better. Better than what? A faithful husband who works two job so you can Go to yoga class. Better than someone who's never lied to you or cheated. The silent stretch. They said marriage kills your soul. Whose soul got killed? Mine. Listening to you repeat your poison every night. Or yours. Because you let strangers reprogram you. She started crying again. I don't know what I want anymore. I do. You want their approval more than my love. You got it. The irony. Her friends are now panicking, realizing they pushed too hard. Janet called later, begging me not to divorce her because she didn't really mean it. Crystal

She returned 6 years later to find I divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years Max. Don't change the locks. She left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation to our 8 year olds. That first night was brutal. Sky, Taylor kept asking when Mommy was coming home and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decisions. No more walking on eggshells around her moods. Things. Year 1 was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curve ball in our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year 2 brought unexpected changes without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids'grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I've been so focused on fixing my marriage that I've forgotten how To enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor, I only helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught sky to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her Bonus Mom, their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes and tucked them in at night. Year 5 was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year 6, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward after Three years of zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from the living.

It started at Thanksgiving when my cousin wouldn't shut up about me being single. She kept asking why I never brought anyone home, making these fake concerned faces at the dinner table. So when she said, I must be dating someone special, I just nodded, gave him a name right on the spot. Daniel said he was busy with work. My family ate it up. But then Christmas rolled around and my mom started asking when she could meet Daniel. My aunt kept texting about setting an extra place at dinner. I was stuck. That's when my roommate Becca suggested her coworker, Daniel, who owed her big time for covering his shifts. He showed me his Instagram, tall brown hair, actually decent looking. He agreed to one dinner as a favor. The problem, he didn't just show up and fake smile through dinner. He brought flowers for my mom, asked my dad about his woodworking hobby and somehow knew my grandmother collected vintage tea cups because I'd mentioned it once when building the fake story. He even laughed at my little brother's terrible jokes about robots. My family was obsessed. After that first dinner, my mom kept inviting him back, Easter brunch, my cousin's graduation party, random Sunday dinners. Daniel never said no. He text me beforehand asking what to bring, if anyone had allergies, stuff like that. He started sending my brother updates about basketball. Scores. My dad asked him to help fix our back porch. The worst part was how natural it felt. We drive to my parents house together and he'd ask about my day like we actually dated, remembered my coffee order, knew I hated mushrooms, would grab my jacket when I got cold. During family game night, he'd automatically pick me as his partner. We had inside jokes that weren't even planned. One night after my aunt's birthday party, we sat in his car outside my apartment in complete silence. Everyone had spent the whole night saying how perfect we looked together, how lucky I was. My grandmother even pulled me aside to say Daniel was a keeper. The whole car ride home, I kept filling glances at him, wondering what he was thinking. I started rehearsing speeches in my bathroom mirror, practice bringing it up casually over coffee. But every time I opened my mouth, nothing came out. How do you tell someone you caught feelings for a fake relationship? Everything changed at Christmas dinner. My aunt announced she'd been looking at wedding venues for us, that she found the perfect place for next fall. Daniel laughed it off perfectly, made some joke about her getting ahead of herself. But later that night, he texted me, we can't keep this up forever. You know, that message hit me like a truck. I realized he was ready to end this whole thing and I wasn't, not even close. Instead of texting Back or giving him some weird speech. I invited him over for dinner at my place, cooked his favorite pasta dish, the one my mom always made when he came over, set the table with actual candles, not just the overhead light. After we finished eating, I was washing dishes and he was drying them, just like we did at my parents house.

Should I tell her after three months of her girls nights turning into therapy sessions about how marriage was just a trap, I was done fighting. She'd come home at 2:00am reeking of wine, telling me about her divorced friends authentic lives, how they were finally free and living their truth. Last week she said, maybe I should have listened when they warned me about settling down. So I stopped trying. Yesterday she noticed you're not fighting for us anymore. If you really loved me, you'd wanna fix this. I looked at her calmly. You want me to fight for our marriage? Yes, obviously. Okay. I pulled out my phone and called her best friend, Janet, the twice divorced one who'd been coaching her. Hey, Janet, it's James. Quick question. Do you think my wife should stay married to someone she regrets being with? My wife's face went white. That's what I thought. Thanks for the honest advice. I hung up and looked at my wife. Janet says, you should definitely leave me. Congratulations. Your advisor just made the decision for you. She started crying. That's not what I wanted. Funny because three months ago you said Janet's advice was the best thing that ever happened to you. But I wasn't done. I called Crystal next 1 who spends weekends bar hopping crying about how all men are trash. Crystal, hey, my wife's been telling me about your amazing Single life. Should she join you? Live that authentic truth with you guys. Talk about. Through the phone, Crystal's voice got quiet. Well, I mean, maybe you two should work it out. Work it out. But you told her marriage was a prison last Tuesday. At least that's what she came home saying. I put the phone on speaker so my wife could hear Crystal back pedal. I was just venting about my own situation. I didn't mean. Oh, so when you said dump his ass and live for yourself, you were just venting. Silence. Then I called Debbie, the twice divorced one living with her parents at 35. Debbie, great news. My wife's finally ready to take your advice about leaving me. When can she move in with you and your mom? Move in. I, there's not really room here. But you said independence was worth any sacrifice. My wife was pale watching her support system crumble in real time. After I hung up, she whispered, they were just trying to help, help. Debbie's eating cereal for dinner because she can't afford groceries. Crystal hasn't had a second date in two years. Janet's on antidepressants because she's so lonely. You don't understand their situations. I understand perfectly. Three miserable women convinced you to throw away a good marriage so you could be miserable with them. She sat down hard. But they said I deserved better. Better than what? A faithful husband who works two job so you can go To yoga class. Better than someone who's never lied to you or cheated. The silent stretch. They said marriage kills your soul. Whose soul got killed? Mine listening to you repeat your poison every night. Or yours because you let strangers reprogram you. She started crying again. I don't know what I want anymore. I do. You want their approval more than my love? You got it. The irony, her friends are now panicking, realizing they pushed too hard. Janet called later begging me not to divorce her because she didn't really mean it. Crystal.

We just fired top tier military tech at something that doesn't even react. Like, it didn't dodge, it didn't block, it just let the missile hit and kept floating. That's not defense, that's disrespect. And we're sitting here like, maybe it's peaceful. Well, it's a bit late for peace when we're the ones firing missiles at it immediately. You don't get to throw hands and then act surprised when it looks back. It was just floating there, minding its business. We threw the first punch, it didn't even blink.

My life has been a living hell since they found my channel and it's getting worse every day, all because of one group of girls. Like it started with hate comments and putting pictures in my locker, but the final straw was when they came into school and handed me a T-shirt of my channel asking if I could sign it since I'm so famous. And bro, her friends acted like this was the funniest thing they've ever seen. But I wasn't gonna just let this slide now. So I did some digging and found all their social media channels and saw that they're actually trying to blow up on TikTok themselves, just not with much success. So since they wanna be famous, I'll make them famous by exposing everything they said all in this video, then sending it to their parents, future college, and blowing this video up from millions to see.

For 17 years, I lived with two different fathers. The perfect employee who preached about his perfect marriage and strong kids, and the man who made mom sob herself to sleep for buying the wrong coffee brand. Mom Learned to time grocery shopping before his Thursday bowling league when he'd be rushed. Once she forgot, dad discovered generic pasta instead of name brand. You're too stupid to even shop, right? No wonder you never amounted to anything. He made her return every item while he watched, then quizzed her on prices to prove she was wasting his money. She cried in the car afterward. That weekend's company barbecue. I do the shopping because the wife gets overwhelmed by choices. His co workers laughed at how understanding he was. My brother walked past Dad's home office during a virtual meet. Invisible for just two seconds, dad kept smiling, discussing collaborative workspace culture. The second he clicked leave meeting, he cornered my brother. You made me look like I can't control my own house. The belt came out. Two weeks of complete silence followed. My brother stopped eating, stopped talking at school. Teachers thought he was just shy. I saved money from my part time job for college application fees, knowing he'd never support it. He found them anyway. You think you're better than me? He burned them in the kitchen sink while I watched. Later, his boss Asked about my plans. She's applying everywhere. We stay up late working on essays together. I nodded and smiled, knowing I'd missed every deadline. Two fathers. Only we knew which one was real. Then my dad announced, the CEO is coming to dinner on Saturday. After ten years grinding for senior VP, a 1 hundred thousand dollar promotion, it came down to this. The CEO was famous for his values based leadership. He'd fired executives for screaming at waitstaff. I passed over vps for bad parenting in public. Now he wanted to see Dad's home life personally. With a three hour dinner. One mistake, dad hissed, and I'll make you regret it forever. But dad had never maintained his perfect act at home for more than 20 minutes. Phone calls, easy, quick. Doorway chats, no problem. But three hours in his kingdom, where he trained us to fear him. That's never happened before. Watched Mom's hands shake, my brother shrink into his chair. For 17 years, home was where dad dropped his mask. Saturday, he'd have to keep it on for three whole hours. There was no way, right? We all prepared like our lives depended on it. Practiced conversations, rehearsed dinner etiquette. Cleaned until the house looked like a magazine spread. I helped mom cover the bags under her eyes. My brother practiced speaking in full sentences. Again. Dad was a wreck. Pretending to be calm. He'd bark orders, catch himself, force a smile. Remember, we're a happy family. He'd say through gritted teeth, the vein in his forehead pulsing. Saturday arrived and the doorbell rang. Showtime, Dad whispered, transforming into the man his co workers knew. A warm smile with a firm handshake. Welcome to our home. The first hour was perfect. Dad told charming stories. We laughed at the right moments. Mom served flawlessly. But I watched dad carefully. Saw his jaw clench when my brother took too long answering a question. I noticed his knuckles whitening when mom laughed too loudly at the CEO's joke. I watched that familiar vein start to pulse. By hour, two cracks appeared. His smile became strained, his laugh forced. He was gripping his wine glass so tight, I thought it might shatter. This was the longest he'd ever had to pretend in his own home. And it was killing him. I didn't have to do anything. I just had to wait. Then it happened. During dessert, mom served the sea

And then one of them says the most fucking driest, corniest and funniest ass joke I've ever heard in my time of living and they all start laughing like a dying pack of hyenas choking on sand.

But imagine being the one person who goes to urgent care with a fever, and the doctor walks in wearing a bird mask and carrying a bag of leeches. That's not medical attention.

There has been a school shooting in Denver. A girl got stabbed on the subway and no one helped her. A decomposing body found in D4V D's car. A man was beheaded at Dallas motel. Charlie Kirk getting shot and killed at a university. And all on top of that, the 9 11 was 24 years ago today. As much as I hate Charlie Kirk and his decisions, no one deserves to get killed. Imagine what his wife and kids are feeling right now. His children can't grow up with their dad. His wife is now a single parent. I genuinely hate Charlie, but I can't imagine how his family is handling this right now. And apparently they witnessed it. The way the blood came out of his neck was genuinely traumatizing. The way his body went limp immediately was horrifying. But anyways, moving on to the D4 V D situation. He's been on tour for like, what, a month now? He hasn't been in LA for like a month. And the body hadn't decomposed enough for it to be in that car for so long. The body was in there for three days. The police haven't even made him a suspect. And plus he had a concert like yesterday, I'm pretty sure. But yeah, moving on to the girl that was stabbed. She was literally minding her business before she got stabbed. And as soon as she got stabbed, everyone was so Calm. Like, hello, she needs help. There was literal blood dripping on the floor. I don't have much information on the other situations, but the fact that this is all happened in a week is honestly scary. Like, this month has just started. What's going on

Because last night I was just scrolling, and a random person texted me saying, you should check out the ducky filter. And like the curious little George I am, I looked up the ducky filter, and I saw a little duck on the screen, and it said, tap the screen. And what did I do? I tap the dang screen. And when I say I scream so loud, I mean I tea. Because how is TikTok allows something like that? I threw my phone across the room so fast, not even the flash could save my phone in time.

My high school made all the boys holding their pee because someone wrote hi on the wall in Sharpie. Monday morning, we all showed up to find a sign taped to the boys bathroom door, closed until further notice due to vandalism. The girls bathroom was still open, of course, but our school only had one bathroom for boys in the entire building because it was an old school built in the 60s when they apparently thought teenage boys never needed to pee. Principal Carpenter made an announcement during 1st period, due to the disrespectful graffiti found in the boys restroom, this facility will remain locked until someone comes forward with information about who did it. The entire male population of our high school groaned at the same time. The crazy part was what the graffiti actually said. My friend Peyton had seen it Friday before they locked everything up. Someone had written hi in tiny letters on the bathroom stall. Not a curse word, not a drawing, just hi, I in black Sharpie about the size of a quarter. By lunch, the situation was getting desperate. Guys were asking teachers for hall passes to go to the nurse's office just to use that bathroom. But the school nurse caught on quick and started turning people away unless they were actually sick. Some guys tried using the staff bathroom but got detention for that. A few desperate souls walked To the gas station across the street during lunch. But security started watching for that, too. We tried talking to Principal Carpenter. Reasonably group of five guys went to his office to explain that punishing 300 boys for one tiny word was insane. He sat behind his big desk with his arms crossed. Actions have consequences. When the vandal comes forward, everyone gets bathroom privileges back. By Wednesday, things were getting bad. Guys were dehydrated from not drinking water all day. The basketball team couldn't practice properly because half the players were holding it in. Parents started calling to complain. The carpenter wouldn't budge. He sent out an email saying this was a lesson in collective responsibility. That's when Dean Patterson had his brilliant idea. He was this quiet kid.

The last one will shock you. His body language gives him away. He sneaks, glances at you, but quickly looks away when you notice. His feet or body are often pointed toward you. He plays with his hands, adjust clothes, taps foot when you're around. TikTok knows someone who has feelings for you, but it's too afraid to tell you it's the second person. When you click share and more, he gets nervous around you. His voice cracks or he stumbles over words. When talking to you, he finds small excuses to be near you. He shows up where you are more often than coincidence allows. He remembers the little things. Comment I hate when and let your keyboard finish the sentence. Even if he doesn't talk much, he notices details about you, like your favourite snack, something you said weeks ago. He pays attention in ways others might overlook. He interacts differently with you than with others. He may be loud and confident with friends, but quiet around you. He engages online more than in person. He texts, comments, or likes your posts, but is quieter face to face. He's more relaxed when there's no direct eye contact. Before the last fact. Please like the video and follow or you might never see me again. His friends know something. They tease him when you're around. They may drop hints or act differently toward you because they know how he Feels

She returned 6 years later to find I divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years Max. Change the locks. She left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation to our 8 year olds. That first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decisions. No more walking on eggshells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curve ball when our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year 2 brought unexpected changes without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids'grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping. I realized I've been so focused on fixing my marriage that I've forgotten how to enjoy my Children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her Bonus Mom, their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes and tucked them in at night. Year 5 was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and be being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year 6, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward after three years of Zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from the living room. Through the window, we watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck, pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she owned the plate.

My wife Stephanie, waited until we were eating dessert at Cassie and Paul's house to drop this on me. We should swap partners every Thursday, she said, and I literally watched her put her hand on Paul's thigh under the table. I saw it. Cassie saw it, too, and her face went blank. What? I asked because I honestly thought I heard her wrong. Partner swapping. We date each other's spouses. Said it like she was talking about switching cars for the weekend. Paul kept staring at his plate and wouldn't make eye contact with me. It's already decided, Stephanie said. Thursday nights, you take Cassie out, Paul takes me. I felt my chest get tight. When did they decide this without me? This is insane, I told her. Then she leaned in close and whispered, room 2:37 last Tuesday when you were at work. My whole body went numb. She was telling me she'd already cheated and now wanted my permission to keep doing it. So are you in or not? She asked louder. I looked at Cassie, and she was crying without making any sound. Fine, I said. Let's swap partners. Stephanie smiled like she just won something, but. And I noticed Cassie had stopped crying completely. That should have told me something right there. When the first date night came around, Stephanie spent forever getting ready. She put on this red Dress I'd never seen before that she'd been hiding in our closet. Paul's car was already running in our driveway when I left. I brought Cassie white roses because I remembered she mentioned liking them once. Her hands shook when she took them. Paul? Never. She started, then stopped. At dinner. She pushed her food around and barely ate anything. You okay? I asked. Paul's been different, she said quietly. For months, even before. Then she stopped talking again. I reached over and touched her hand. Before what? Nothing. Forget I said anything. But then her phone lit up with Stephanie's name, and she turned it face down immediately. When I got home that night, Stephanie was already there. Her hair was all messed up and her lipstick was smeared on the wrong side of her mouth. How is Cassie? Good. It was Paul. Then she started telling me everything they did. The hotel room, the balcony, what they did against the wall. She kept getting louder with each detail. Stop, I told her. Why? Don't you wanna know? No. Her face got all twisted up. Well, I'm telling you anyway. She kept going with more details while I pulled out my phone and texted Cassie, thank you for a lovely evening. Stephanie saw my screen and threw her wine glass at the wall. It shattered everywhere, and I just stood there looking at her. The next week, I had to pick Cassie up because her car broke down. Out Of nowhere. Paul was supposed to drive me, she said, looking confused. I forgot at dinner. She had way too much wine. Can I tell you something? She asked, and her eyes looked glassy. Tuesday afternoons. That's when it started. My heart started racing. What started? She covered her mouth with her hand. Nothing. Forget it. But Tuesday was when Stephanie had mentioned the hotel and we both knew what she meant. Then we had to go to Stephanie's parents house for dinner. Stephanie showed up late and I could smell Paul's Cologne all over her clothes. Her mom noticed it right away and her face changed. Is that men's Cologne? The whole table went quiet. We're sharing partners with Cassie and Paul, I said. Every week. Her dad dropped his fork and it made this loud sound. Sharing? Taking turns dating each other's spouses. Stephanie's idea. Her mom stood up from the table in my house, she said, and her voice was shaking. Stephanie tried to explain, but everyone had already smelled the Cologne and knew what was happening. That night Cassie called me. I know about Tuesday afternoons. I felt sick to my stomach about them. I followed Paul once four months ago to the hotel. She sounded drunk. I saw everything. By week five, everything fell apart. It was Cassie's birthday and I threw her a surprise party, made a video of all her artwork and gave the speech about how talented and kind she was. Paul Forgot it was her birthday completely. I watched Stephanie watch Cassie cry happy tears and hold on to me like she didn't want to let go. That night, Stephanie came home from Paul's and started telling me what they did in graphic detail again. Stop! I don't want to hear it. She got mad. But I'm telling you everything. I didn't ask. Then she demanded to know what Cassie and I did together.

So I packed my things and left, but now she's begging me to come back. Last Sunday at my in law's house for their 30th anniversary dinner, everything seemed perfect. My wife Emma was helping her mom arrange flowers while I watched the game with her dad. My buddy Josh was there, too. He's been like family since college, always invited to everything. The whole extended family was there, maybe 20 people total. Emma's cousins, her weird Uncle Dave who likes vintage spoons. Her grandmother, who still asks when we're having kids even though we've been trying for three years. After dinner, her Aunt Linda starts this thing where everyone shares their sliding door moments. Those what if scenarios that keep you up at night. Everyone's going around the table sharing cute stories. Her cousin Sarah talks about almost moving to Japan to teach English. Uncle Dave mentions nearly buying Bitcoin in 2,010. Her brother Tom jokes about almost joining the military instead of becoming an accountant. Normal, harmless stuff that gets people thinking. Then it's Emma's turn. She's had a few glasses of wine, and she gets this dreamy, distant look in her eyes, like she's somewhere else entirely. Honestly, she says, looking directly at Josh across the table, I sometimes think I should have dated Josh instead of Mark back in college. We just click so naturally, you know, the entire table goes Dead silent. Her dad literally chokes on his coffee and starts coughing violently. Her mom drops her fork with a loud clatter. Her grandmother's mouth falls open. I'm sitting right there like a complete idiot, watching my wife of eight years fantasize about my best friend in front of our entire family. Josh's face goes bright red. He starts stammering something about how that's not appropriate. But Emma just keeps going like she's in some kind of trance. I mean, we have so much more in common than Mark and I. I do. Josh actually listens when I talk about my art projects. He gets my sense of humor. He remembers little things I say. Sometimes I wonder if I settled too quickly. That last part hit like a freight train. Settled? After eight years of marriage, two miscarriages, buying our first house together, and me working overtime to pay for her art supplies, I settled. I excused myself to the bathroom. But really, I just sat in my car for 20 minutes trying to process what had just happened. My hands were shaking. I called my brother Mike, but couldn't even form words to explain. When I came back inside, everyone was pretending nothing happened, making awkward small talk.

Last Tuesday, I was making lunch for my kids when my phone rang. Unknown number, but I picked up anyway. Big mistake, right? This guy with a thick accent starts telling me he's from the IRS and I owe $4,200 in back taxes. As if I don't pay immediately with gift cards, the police will arrest me within an hour. Now, here's the thing. I literally just got my tax refund two weeks ago. My accountant, Beth, handled everything perfectly and I even got money back. So I knew this dude was full of it. But instead of hanging up, something clicked in my brain. My neighbour, Missus Kim, had fallen for this exact scam last month and lost $800. Time for payback. I started crying into the phone, oh, no, I can't go to jail. My kids need me. The scammer ate it up. He told me to go to target and buy iTunes gift cards worth $2,000 as a first payment. I said I needed an hour to get the money together. First, I called my cousin, Jake, who's a cop, told him what was happening and he said to keep the guy on the line as long as possible. Then I started my revenge tour. I called the scammer back an hour later sobbing. I'm at target, but I'm so confused. Which gift cards do I buy? He walked me through it step by step. I pretended to be this helpless Single mom who didn't understand technology. Sorry, can you repeat that? My hands are shaking so bad. For the next 20 minutes, I wandered around target asking him questions. Do I need the physical cards or the digital ones? The cashier is asking for ID is that normal? Sorry, my 4 year old is having a meltdown in the cart. Finally, I told him I had the cards. He was so excited, probably thinking about his commission. I read him the first number. Okay, it starts with 5. Wait, is that a 5?

When I was 8, my cousin Tiffany came to live with us for six months while her parents sorted out their divorce. I'd always wanted a sister and suddenly having a 12 year old girl in the house who knew about makeup and had actual opinions about music seems like winning the lottery. My mom set up the guest room for her with new curtains and cleared out half the closet. Dad built an extra shelf for her books. My little brother Sean, who was only 5 then, followed her everywhere until she taught him a secret handshake that made him feel special. The first weekend Tiffany was with us, she suggested we build a time capsule. I collected items all week. I contributed my favorite marble. Sean added a plastic Dinosaur. Mom put in a recipe card and dad included a baseball card. Tiffany added something wrapped in tissue paper that she wouldn't show anyone. This stays sealed until exactly 10 years from now, Tiffany said. As we buried it under the old maple tree in the backyard. We marked the spot with rocks arranged in a circle. Every Sunday became capsule checking day, where we'd go out to make sure the rocks hadn't been disturbed. Sometimes Tiffany would press her ear to the ground and claim she could hear our treasures talking to each other. Sean believed her completely. I pretended to believe but secretly knew better. Still, I played along. In Month 4, our neighbors Adrian and Yasmin invited us to their daughter Molly's birthday party. Molly was Tiffany's age and they become friends at school. The day before the party, I overheard mom on the phone. I know it's difficult, but you need to make a decision soon, mom said. She's doing well here. She asks about you every day. That night, Tiffany taught me to braid my hair. Her fingers worked quickly and I sat perfectly still, afraid any movement might make her stop. When she finished, she took a picture with her disposable camera. This is how I'll remember you, she said. At Molly's party, the adults gathered in the kitchen while us kids played games in the basement. I noticed Tiffany kept checking the stairs. When Molly's mom called everyone up for cake, Tiffany pulled me aside. I have to tell you something, she whispered. I'm going back home next week. The cake tasted like nothing. After that, I watched Tiffany laugh with Molly and the other older girls. She seemed happy, not like someone about to leave everything behind. On her last night with us, we had pizza, Tiffany's favorite, with extra cheese. Dad made ice cream sundaes and mom gave Tiffany a necklace with a tiny silver heart. Sean cried when he found out she was leaving and refused to do their secret handshake. It won't be special anymore if we do it when I'm leaving, Tiffany explained after Sean went to bed. Tiffany And I sat on the porch swing. I wanted to ask her why she had to go, why she couldn't just stay with us forever. But instead, I asked about the time capsule. What did you put in there that you wouldn't show us? A letter to you, she said, about why I really came to stay here. The next morning, her dad picked her up in a car I'd never seen before. Mom hugged him for a long time. Tiffany hugged each of us. But when she got to me, she whispered, remember 10 years? We got two postcards from her that summer, then Christmas cards for a few years, then nothing. Mom said, people get busy. Dad said, that's just how life works sometimes. When I was 13, Sean wanted to dig up the time capsule early. I wouldn't let him. I promised Tiffany we'd wait the full 10 years. Last month marked exactly 10 years. I came home from college for the weekend and went straight to the maple tree. The rocks were gone. Landscapers had redone the yard years ago. I dug where I thought the capsule should be. Nothing. I tried another spot. Nothing again. I was about to give up when my shovel hit something.

The waitress, this woman in her 50s with kind eyes just keeps refilling my coffee without saying anything. Second night, same thing. Third night she finally asks, rough patch, honey? I nod and try not to cry into my syrup. By the end of week two, I'm there every single night at exactly 2:00am. Same booth, same order, same pathetic scrolling routine. That's when she sits down across from me. Alright, sweetie, you've been here 14 nights straight. Crying into pancakes. What's his name? And I just break. I tell her everything, how he cheated, how he moved in with her immediately, how all our mutual friends picked sides. She listens to every word while bringing me free pie.

Hank, this massive guy with tattoo sleeves, looks at me And goes, what kind of idiot breaks a heart like that? Then he makes me these incredible chocolate chip pancakes shaped like a heart.

By week 5, they're basically running a late night therapy session. Other customers start joining our conversation. There's this trucker named Malik who shares his divorce story. A nurse coming off her shift who talks about her toxic ex. We become this weird little support group. Week 6, guess who walks in at 2:00am with his new girlfriend?

Took a pic of me holding my smoothie. Healthy, glowing, feeling. Great. TikTok said unwell by Matchbox 20. Hello, I'm drinking spinach, not crying in the club. Then I tested my roommate. He took a photo of his car keys. TikTok gave him Boulevard of broken dreams. Bro just wanted to go to Walgreens. Now he's in an existential spiral over his 2,012 Civic. Next, I snapped a pic of my bed. Just my bed. No messy sheets, no emotional context. TikTok gave me lonely by Akon. Now I'm hugging my pillow like it's a person. Why am I being attacked?

She was like, honestly, fair? It's the only one that didn't feel like a punch in the chest. At this point, I'm convinced TikTok ain't just an app. It's an AI therapist with Wi-Fi and zero chill. Go try it. Snap a pic. But be warned, TikTok might know your deepest fears, and it will expose them with a banger.

When I turned 15, my mom went from strict to straight up paranoid. One night after dinner, she plopped down next to me with this weird smile and said she was installing a family safety app on my phone. I watched her tap away, giving herself access to everything. My location, photos, texts, even my drafts on social media. It's just to keep you safe, honey, she said, handing my phone back like nothing had changed. But everything had changed. It felt like having a stalker who lived in my house. At first I tried to be cool about it. Maybe it would calm her down, right? Wrong. Things got insane fast. She text me in the middle of conversations asking who I was with. Comment on memes I haven't even posted yet because she was reading my drafts. The worst part? She started replying to my friends pretending to be me. My buddy Jake texted asking if I wanted to hang out, and my mom replied, sure. Sure thing, buddy! With way too many exclamation points. Jake called me laughing, asking why I was texting like a soccer mom. I had no idea what he meant until I checked my messages. Then came the day that broke me. I was in history class when Mrs. Wilson pulled me aside. Looked uncomfortable as hell. Liam, your mother called the school. She's concerned about some message you sent about Me. My stomach dropped. I knew exactly what she meant. I texted my best friend Kyle the night before, joking about how our history teacher's haircut looked like she stuck her finger in an electrical socket. It was just good friend stuff, not meant for anyone else. But my mom had read it and called the school to complain about my private joke. I wanted to disappear into the floor. By lunch, Kyle wasn't talking to me. Neither was Jake. Word got around that my mom was reading everything, and suddenly nobody wanted to text me anymore. Some kids even blocked me. It was like my social life had a disease. And the disease was my mom. That night, I stared at my phone, feeling trapped. But then I noticed something. The tracking app worked both ways. It log every time someone access the account. I spent hours studying those logs, and what I found made my skin crawl. My mom wasn't just checking my phone during the day. She was logging in 1 a m, 2 a m, even 3 a m. She was forwarding my messages to her laptop. She was screenshotting my photos. She was living inside my phone 24 7. So I came up with a plan. I created a fake friend named Daniel, made up this whole persona, gave him a backstory. Even found some random photos online to use as his profile pic on a group chat with myself.

There has been a school shooting in Denver. A girl got stabbed on the subway and no one helped her. A decomposing body found in D4V D's car. A man was beheaded at a Dallas motel. Charlie Kirk getting shot and killed at a university. And all on top of that, the 9 11 was 24 years ago today. As much as I hate Charlie Kirk and his decisions, no one deserves to get killed. Imagine what his wife and kids are feeling right now. His children can't grow up with their dad. His wife is now a single parent. I genuinely hate Charlie, but I can't imagine how his family is handling this right now. And apparently they witnessed it. The way the blood came out of his neck was genuinely traumatizing. The way his body went limp immediately was horrifying. But anyways, moving on to the D4 V D situation. He's been on tour for like what, a month now? He hasn't been in LA for like a month. And the body hadn't decomposed enough for it to be in that car for so long. The body was in there for three days, and the police haven't even made him a suspect. And plus he had a concert like yesterday, I'm pretty sure. But yeah, moving on to the girl that was stabbed. She was literally minding her business before she got stabbed. And as soon as she got stabbed, everyone Was so calm, like, hello, she needs help. There was literal blood dripping on the floor. I don't have much information on the other situations, but the fact that this is all happened in a week is honestly scary. Like, this month has just started. What's going on

I need a big, strong man. I was upstairs doing laundry, but could hear everything through the vents. Usually I'd rescue Kevin from the awkwardness, but something made me stay. But maybe I wanted to see how far she'd take it. Oh, my God, Kevin, you're so musky! She giggled, clearly touching his arm. Do you work out every day? I bet you could lift me with one hand. Wanna try? I rolled my eyes. This girl had zero shame. I kept folding clothes, waiting for Kevin's polite deflection. Instead, I heard him say, seriously, Ariana, can I tell you something important? My heart sank. Oh, god, here we go. Two years of marriage down the drain because

Mom's eating breakfast scrolling through Facebook while Dad's counting out quarters for gas money when she announces we're all downloading life 3 60. We're two months behind on the electrical, but her friend says this app is the only way to keep family safe and honest. I'm 17 and work hard time at target. My dad does construction. We don't have time to be anything but safe and honest. She says if we have nothing to hide, we have nothing to fear. Which sounds like something a dictator would say, but whatever. She makes us install it right there at the table and checks that everyone's location is on. And I realize immediately what she doesn't understand about this app. Life 3 60 doesn't just show where you are. It shows your speed when driving, your phone battery, and sends notifications for everything, including when someone checks someone else's location. Mom works from home doing medical billing and has nothing but time to watch that app all day while dad and I are actually out in the world. Perfect. Now I'll know everyone's safe, she says. But what she means is now she can watch us like the musical jolly chimp from Toy Story. Her phone buzzes and she glances at it. Oh, shoot, I have a doctor's appointment in an hour. Dad offers to drive her, but she says no, she needs the car. All Day for Aaron. After months ago, my mom asked me to start covering for her when she goes out saying she's shopping or at the doctors. Whenever dad asks where she is, men lose interest when you mention women. Things she tell me she doesn't realize she just set herself up. Day one and my phone buzzes every 10 minutes with mom check your location while I'm at school. Dad text me she checked me 14 times this morning and we both realize she's literally sitting. They're refreshing the app constantly instead of working. Day 3 mom calls me screaming because the app says I was going 67 in a 65 and threatens to take my keys. So I start driving under the speed limit, which means I'm late to work and my manager writes me up. Dad gets stuck in traffic, won't go even 1 mile per hour over because mom will see. Shows up 30 minutes late to his job site and loses a client worth $2,000. Week two she sees I stopped at McDonald's for three minutes and lectures me about wasting money. Which is rich considering she was at the grocery store for four hours yesterday and came back with just milk saying nothing good on sale. Dad checks the app and asks her four hours at one store and mom glares at me like I should have warned her he was checking, but how can I when she's watching my every move? She used to Text me to cover for her now. She can't without dad seeing our messages about her lies. Week three, she's at a medical plaza until 11 p m. Dad mentions that's your fourth appointment this week. You okay? She snaps. Women's health is very thorough, but I've been to that clinic. They close at 6. That night, dad asks me privately, does your mom seem sick to you? I pull up her location history, all those medical building visits, and we're both hoping it isn't true. However, the electric Bill arrives, marked Final Notice, and dad slams it on the counter so hard the salt shaker falls over. I gave you $400 for that. And mom says, processing delay. It's fine. Dad and I are both staring at her location, chin pins on the map. Week 5, and dad texts me, I'm leaving work early. Something's not right. Meet me at the medical plaza. We both see Mom's been there since 11 a m, and it's now 6 p m. I tell my manager I'm sick and drive over. Dad's already there in the parking lot, looking at life. 3 60, zoom.

My brother Jake has this girlfriend named Becca who literally cannot stand not being the center of attention for 5 minutes. Every family dinner, every holiday, every gathering, she finds a way to make it about her. Last Thanksgiving, she announced she was pregnant right when my dad was about to carve the Turkey. Turns out she wasn't even pregnant. Just wanted to see everyone's reactions. So when I was planning my wedding to my fiance, Ryan, I knew I had to do something about the Becca situation. This was going to be my one day, the one day that was supposed to be about me and Ryan starting our life together. I called Jake about three months before the wedding. Hey, so about the wedding, I started. I need to ask you something kind of awkward. What's up, he said. And I could hear him eating cereal in the background. I really don't want Becca there. I know that sounds harsh, but she always makes everything about herself and I just can't deal with that stress on my wedding day. The line went quiet for like 10 seconds. Then Jake exploded. Are you serious right now you're uninviting my girlfriend from your wedding? I'm not uninviting her because she was never invited in the first place. The invitation was just for you. That's the same thing. We've been together for two years. He's basically family. I tried. To explain that it wasn't personal, that I just wanted one drama free day. But Jake wasn't having it. He said if Becca couldn't come, then he wouldn't come either. I told him that was his choice, hoping he'd change his mind. He didn't. But here's where it gets crazy. The day of my wedding, I'm getting my makeup done in the bridal suite when my cousin Madison bursts in. Uh, you need to see this, she says, shoving her phone in my face. Becca's Instagram story. She's posted like 15 videos of herself getting all dressed up, doing her makeup, picking out jewelry. The caption on the last one says, can wait to celebrate love today with a bunch of heart emojis and the location tagged as our wedding venue. My heart drops. She's coming anyway. Madison nods. Jake's outside right now arguing with your dad about it. He says he changed his mind and decided to bring her. I'm standing there in my wedding dress, half my makeup done, and I have to deal with.

I found my work crush share crying in the break room, looking completely stressed. My dad's in the hospital and I need to fly out tonight, but I can't find anyone to watch my kids. My ex won't answer. The babysitter I hired bailed. And I just, I can't afford to miss this flight, but I can't afford anything else either. She leaned against my shoulder crying even harder. I volunteered without thinking. I'll watch them, I said. Heart racing from how close she was to me. Are you serious? It's three kids, 3 for at least two weeks. Waved my hand around like a lovesick fool. How hard can it be? The kids showed up at my apartment that night with tons of suitcases. The oldest around 14, looked at her mom and said, really? Another boyfriend? Cher's face went red. He's just a friend from work. Camilla, the middle one, 10, rolled his eyes. The youngest, 7, wouldn't even look at me, stood in my doorway like they were being sentenced to prison. Cher hug them quickly, told them to be good and left for the airport. I stood there with three kids who clearly hated me and realized I was in way over my head. The first morning I woke up early to make them pancakes. When the oldest one, Camilla, laughed, she's not here, you know, you can stop trying, she said. Besides You're not her type. Mom doesn't date guys without kids. We've seen this a dozen times already. It hurt, but it wasn't a lie. Shares, coworkers, guys from her gym, men from dating apps, everyone wanted to play dad until they realized three kids meant actual work. And the kids really didn't make it any easier. From spilling drinks on my laptop to turning the TV up during important zoom meetings, they hated every second with me. Dude, just survive until she gets back, then ask her out. My friend told me that became the plan. Survive two weeks, do whatever to keep the kids happy, be the hero, finally land a date with share. But like most things, it doesn't always happen the way you want it to. Sometime within the second week, the middle kid, Murph, came home from school trying to hide a black eye. Before I could even ask, Camilla grabbed ice from the freezer and held it against his face. Just pretend you didn't see anything, she hold me coldly. I bent down beside them and asked in a kind but stern voice, tell me what happened. Just leave me alone, he said. Turning away, I shook my head. I'm not here to lecture you or get mad at you or do anything without your permission, not even tell your mom. But I need to know what happened. Murph blinked at me and frowned. Someone called me an orphan because I don't have a dad. I patted his head and walking away as calm as I could, even though all the blood in my body was boiling with anger. The next afternoon, I took a half day at work and showed up at their school in a rented GTR, strikingly white engine purring like a monster. I rolled down the window and waved wearing sunglasses and a black polo. Who's got the coolest dad now, I said loudly as Murph and his friends ran over excitedly. Murph watched his bully's jaw drop and quickly he hopped in. He rolled down the window and flipped him off, which was my signal to immediately drive off the middle school campus. Okay, I like the enthusiasm, but let's never tell your mother about this, I said. I picked up the other two kids and took them to in and out for a quick afternoon snack, then surprised them with a baseball game. Murph ate in a helmet full of nachos and I managed to snag a foul ball for little Celia. Not bad, old man, Camilla said, watching her siblings enjoy the game, we made sure to take pics with the car and at the stadium, all covered in ketchup and mustard. I sent everything to their mom with a caption, we wish you were here. After that, things between me and the kids sort of changed. When the youngest, Celia, had a nightmare and called for her mom, I sat beside her bed reading out fairy tales. Until she fell asleep. I made the kids meals and lunch box.

Who's that lady mom, Skyler asked Eleanor, genuinely confused. Walter squinted at my ex, trying to place her, wait, aren't you the woman from those old pictures in Dad's closet? My ex's face crumbled. Six years expecting to pick up where she left off, only to discover she'd been completely replaced. The kids she abandoned barely remembered her, and the man she thought would wait forever had built a beautiful new life. I came home, she whispered. This isn't your home anymore, I replied calmly, it hasn't been for six years. She looked around our kitchen. Eleanor's recipe cards on the counter, the kids artwork on the walls, our wedding photo by the coffee maker. Everything screamed happy family, and she wasn't part of it. The woman who left expecting everything to pause for her return realized that life had moved on completely without her. Her own children called another woman mom.

I recently gave birth to twin girls. I had kept this a secret from my family to surprise them. A month before I gave birth, my sister's child tragically passed away from SIDS and my family mourned the loss of the baby. When I gave birth, my whole family visited me except for my sister and her husband. I understood because they were still grieving. News quickly spread that I had given birth to twins. My sister visited with her in laws. Her mother in law immediately said that god had sent another their baby for my sister, claiming one of my twins was a reincarnation of their lost child. I firmly told them that both babies were mine. They held my twins and looked at each other, convinced that one of them was indeed their lost baby. My husband quickly took our babies and to them out. Later that day, my mother visited and insisted I should give one of my twins to my sister because she was mourning. I refused, told her they are mine. The next morning we saw on our ring camera her mother in law was standing in front of our door at 3:00am praying. It's sent chills down my spine. I threatened them to leave us alone every day for one week. A dead bird that was gutted is on our porch and a red colored stain the sides of our home. My Husband and I knew right then we have to leave. My husband called the police and said they cannot do anything as somebody might be just playing with us. Red stain on the wall and our door was an animal's blood. They offered to file for a restraining order once we figured who did it. My husband was eager and knew who it was after we reviewed the footage of our ring camera. I told him not to since it's my sister's in laws and maybe talking to them will sort this out. I don't believe in this kind of arrangement. But I was wrong. After her mother in law's visit, I told my sister about her weird behaviour and it did scare us. I'm not sure if she ever said anything, but her mother in law kept coming back at exactly 3:00am, praying. She would stay on the porch, standing, whispering while her head tilted. My sister then told me that I shouldn't keep my own kids from her and that she should feel bad because she lost her child. She went on telling me what I would feel if I lost a child. She had been the favourite child and she gets everything all the time. It's just one time where things didn't favor her. After. My sister terrorized me every day, sending me thousands of messages and emails. One morning we found a dead bird on our porch, gutted as if someone had intentionally it. It went On for a week, I called my sister and told her that if her mother in law visited again, we would call the police. My sister never replied. A few days later, everyone including me, my twins and my husband started to get really sick. I felt like somebody had done something to us and I suspected it was her mother in law. My mother came to stay and help since we had been so sick. Not only that, my husband got into a car accident where someone rear ended him on the freeway, destroying our car. Thankfully, my husband wasn't seriously injured. The second one, we were lucky enough because we had our kids in the back. With my husband's quick reflexes, he was able to avoid the car on his right, which collided with a car in front of us, hitting another car, which resulted in two casualties. One day, I let my mother visit me to help with the chores. Same evening, my husband came home from work and woke me up, showing me footage from the ring camera. While I was resting, my mother had let my sister and her husband into our home. My sister then took one of the twins, cradled her and even breastfed her. They took family photos with my baby. I was alarmed and furious. I didn't hesitate to file a restraining order against my sister, her husband and my mother. Not only that, but I also discovered my mother had Put a sleeping pill in my soup. After my husband, right before taking the trash out, saw the box, which explains how I was knocked out for eight hours. I started to get really scared because they were doing everything they could to get my child. My husband decided we needed to leave our home and move somewhere else. We didn't stay for long, and

Everyone cheered and raised their glasses. I stepped outside and made one phone call. 10 minutes later, screaming started. See, two years ago when dad had his heart attack, I discovered something. They were three months behind on mortgage payments. The bank was for closing next week. My family had no idea. Dad was too proud to tell anyone. So I used my entire divorce settlement, $180,000, to buy the house at auction. I created an LLC called Clearwater Holdings and let them keep living there without telling them. I figured I'd transfer it back once they got stable again. Now my brother Marcus thinks he can just sell it and split the money. He's already called two realtors. The irony wasn't lost on me. For two years, I've been quietly paying property taxes, insurance and maintenance costs. Every time something broke, I'd anonymously arrange for repairs. The new roof last spring, that was me. The HVAC system that mysteriously got warranty coverage, also me. Marcus had been living rent free in a house I owned while constantly reminding everyone how successful he was compared to his loser sister. When I walked back inside, he was drawing renovation plans on napkins with his wife, Jennifer. We could add a wine cellar, he was saying, gesturing wildly with his beer, and a home theater, Jennifer added, her eyes practically blowing with dollar signs. Mom Was nodding enthusiastically. Oh, and we could finally get that kitchen island I've always wanted. Dad sat quietly in his chair looking uncomfortable but not saying anything. He'd always hated confrontation. My teenage nephew Tyler was on his phone, probably already shopping for the car Marcus had promised him from his inheritance share. Actually, I said calmly, walking back to the dining room table. I need to tell you something important. Just didn't even look up from his sketching. If you're gonna beg us to let you stay, save it, he laughed. Decisions made. Jenny already found us a realtor friend who can get us top dollar. Really, I said sitting down across from him. That's interesting because I just got off the phone with my attorney. Mom rolled her eyes dramatically. Alex, honey, you can't afford an attorney. Stop being so dramatic about this. James Morrison from Morrison and Associates. I can continued ignoring her comment. He specializes in real estate law. Dad finally looked up with interest. Why were you talking to a real estate attorney, sweetheart? Because I wanted to understand what happened when someone tries to sell a house they don't legally own. The room went completely silent. Even Tyler looked up from his phone. Marcus's pen stopped moving. What are you talking about? Mom and dad own this house. They've lived here for 30 years. They lived here for 30 years, I corrected calmly, but they haven't owned it for the past 14 months. Dad's Face had gone completely pale. Alex, what are you saying? I pulled out my phone and opened the email James had sent me. According to the county property records, this house is owned by Clearwater Holdings LLC. It was purchased at foreclosure auction 14 months ago for $165,000. Marcus stood up so fast his chair nearly fell over.

Turns out I got her pregnant. I was so scared to ruin my marriage, I told her to go back to Italy to have the baby. Told, if you have it in Italy, I'll give you 25,000 up front, and I'll pay child support every month until the kid is 18. She was skeptical at first, but eventually she agreed. But then she was like, but how would you know when the baby is born? And honestly, that was a good question. So I thought about it for a second. I was like, well, when the baby is born, send me a postcard, and on the back of it write spaghetti. And I told her, I said, once I receive that post card, I start sending the child support money. Then one day, about nine months later, I come home to my confused wife. Soon as I walked in, she was like, already? There's this weird postcard made out out to you. And I was like, just give me it. I'll explain it later. And obviously she agreed. But when I read the card, I literally passed out, and I woke up three hours later in the hospital. When I woke up, I asked my wife if she still had the postcard with her, and she said yes. So I said, please give me that. I thought I was seeing things, but when I read the card again, Nah, it was serious. The card read spaghetti, spaghetti, spaghetti. Two with meatballs, one without. Send extra sauce.

You ever get betrayed so bad it doesn't just hurt, it rewrites you. That was me. My ex best friend Eli stabbed me in the back in a way I still don't fully understand. We've been close since we were kids, shared everything, laughed until our stomachs hurt. I thought we were brothers. Then senior year came around and I found out he'd been using me. Not in the he copied my homework way. No, this was deeper. He took everything I told him in confidence about my anxiety, my insecurities, my family stuff, my parents messy divorce and used it to build clout with a group of people I thought hated me. Turned my personal life into a punchline. I confronted him and he just smirked and said, grow a thicker skin, dude. It's just jokes. That night I decided to become someone else. It started off stupid. I wanted revenge. Nothing deep, just enough to embarrass him. I made a fake profile of a girl and named her J. It started off small, like turning my pictures into a female version, setting up a fake Instagram. My plan was simple, get him to say some pathetic flirty stuff and then leak it to the school. But Eli fell fast, faster than I expected. And the more he fell, the more I leaned in. What was at first meant to be a two Week job quickly turned full time. By week three, I was using a voice changer to call him. He'd call me every night before bed. Obviously I needed some compensation, so he'd cash app me 10 bucks every call. He'd say stuff like I've never felt this comfortable with anyone. He opened up in ways I'd never seen before. The way he talked to her, the way he needed her. And I started to realize something. He never respected me, but this version of me, this soft voiced, smiling, wide eyed girl from a few towns over, he worshipped her. What started as a joke stretched into weeks, then months. I'd spend hours each day crafting conversations, sinking voice filters, sending selfies, managing multiple burner accounts. I created playlists, family stories, fake college plans. I Learned everything about his insecurities, his fear of being alone, of not being good enough, of being forgotten. And I used all of it. A year in, I realized I'd gone too far. This wasn't revenge anymore. This was something else. I wasn't just catfishing him. I was breaking him and myself slowly and quietly. But the worst part was that I didn't stop. That's when the real revenge started. Jade became distant.

Oh, honey, let me tell you about the time my daughter didn't talk to me for two whole weeks because I betrayed her trust over a damn chicken nugget. So my daughter Lila, she's 14, has the attitude of a Beverly Hills housewife and the budget of a toddler. This girl acts like she's the CEO of the household. Tells me things like, mom, please don't embarrass me in front of my friends. Just stand still and blink like, ma'am, you live in my uterus rent free for nine months. Show some respect. Anyway, she decides she's going vegan. Great. I support her. I buy tofu, almond milk, overpriced plant nuggets that taste like regret. The whole shebang. Do I understand it? No, but I'm a supportive queen. But then one night, it's 1:00am, I'm watching reality TV in the dark, and I get hungry. I open the freezer and see those dino shaped chicken nuggets she begged for last year and never ate. So I pop, like, four in the air fryer. I'm minding my business, living my best life, and guess what? I forget to hide the evidence. Next morning, she walks into the kitchen, sniffs the air like a bloodhound, and goes, did you eat meat in this house? I said, uh, maybe. She gasps like, I just committed war crimes. You ate dead animals while I was sleeping? I said, baby girl, they were shaped like dinosaurs. They're barely meat. Calm down. She grabs her reusable water bottle, slams it on the counter, and yells, this is why the planet's dying, Because of people like you who can't control their midnight cravings! I said, okay, Greta Thunberg, relax. She storms off to her room and text me from down the hall, we're not speaking. This is a betrayal. I text back, fine, more dino nuggets for me. She leaves me on read y'all. Two weeks he wouldn't speak to me. Not even when I stubbed my toe and screamed so loud the neighbours checked on me. She just walked past me with her Hydro flask and judgmental aura. But then get this. One day I come home early from work, I walk into the kitchen, and there she is, standing in front of the microwave holding a plate with three dino nuggets. She's caught mid bite. We lock eyes. Time freezes. She goes, they don't count if they're Dinosaur shaped. I said, excuse me? She wipes her mouth like a criminal and goes, don't tell dad. I said, oh, I'm telling everyone. She bribes me with her leftover Starbucks gift card and begs for mercy. I post the photo in our family group chat anyway. Caption our little activist caught mid murder her grandpa.

It started about six months ago. Every argument, every little thing that didn't go her way, slam. Every time I asked her to do dishes, slam. When I told her she couldn't go to some party where I knew they'd be drinking, slam! The sound would shake the whole upstairs. My coffee mug fell off my nightstand twice from the vibrations. My husband Dave, kept telling me to ignore it. He'd say, kids go through phases. She'll grow out of it. Easy for him to say, since he's usually at work when most of the slamming happens. I'm the one working from home, trying to take client calls while slam! Echoes through the house. The breaking point came on a Tuesday. Emma wanted to borrow my car to drive to her friend Jesse's house. I said no because she got a speeding ticket the week before, and we agreed her driving privileges were suspended. She started screaming about how unfair I was, how I never trust her, how all her friends think I'm psycho. Then she stomped upstairs and slam! But this time was different. This time I heard something crack. Went up to check, and there was a split running down the door frame. The wood was actually damaged. That door had been slammed so hard and so many times that it was breaking the house. I stood there staring at that crack, and something just snapped. In me, I marched to the garage, grabbed Dave's screwdriver set, and went back upstairs. Emma was inside her room blasting music, probably expecting me to yell at her through the door like usual. Instead, I started unscrewing the hinges. It took me about 10 minutes. Emma didn't even notice until I was lifting the door off the frame. Then her music stopped real quick. Mom, what are you doing? She called out. Solving a problem, said carrying her door downstairs to the garage. She appeared at the top of the stairs in her pajamas, mouth hanging open. You can't take my door. I need privacy. You lost your privileges when you damaged the house, I told her. Privacy is earned, not guaranteed. The next few days were interesting. Emma tried everything. She hung a bed sheet across the doorway, which I took down. She moved her dresser to block the opening, so I moved it back. While she was at school, she even tried staying at her friend's house. Jess's mom called me asking what was going on. By day four, Emma was sitting on her bed when I got home from the grocery store. No music, no phone. Just sitting there. This is embarrassing. She. What if someone comes over? Then maybe you'll think twice before destroying property. I said I wasn't destroying anything. I was just mad. The door frame says otherwise. That's when she actually looked at the crack she'd made. I could see her face. Change. When she realised she'd actually damaged something. Day seven was when things got real. Emma's boyfriend Tyler came over to work on some school project. I watched from the kitchen as he walked upstairs, expecting to go into her room and

My best friend Jess was getting married and asked me to be her photographer. I've been doing photography for like three years now, mostly just for fun and some side cash, but nothing super professional. She said she trusted me more than some random person and honestly couldn't afford a real wedding photographer anyway. The wedding was beautiful. I spent the entire day running around getting shots of everything. We're getting ready, walking down the aisle, the first kiss, all the family photos. I was exhausted, but felt good about it. I probably took like 800 photos that day. After the reception, Jess pulled me aside and said she couldn't wait to see them. It was literally glowing with excitement. I told her I'd edit them and have them ready in a week. That's when things got weird. Two days later, Jess texted me asking if I could rush the photos because her and her husband Jake wanted to post them on social media. I said sure, no problem. But then she started texting me every single day asking for updates. Like multiple times a day. Then she called me crying, saying her mom was asking about the photos and could I please just send her like five unedited ones? I sent her a few, thinking that would calm her down. Wrong. The next day she showed up at my apartment unannounced. She had Jake with her and they both looked Stressed, she said they needed to talk about the photos. Apparently, Jess's mom had been showing the unedited photos I sent to family members, and now everyone was asking why the photographer didn't know how to use proper lighting. Jess said she was embarrassed and needed me to fix them immediately. I explained that editing takes time, and I was working on them, but she cut me off and said she'd found another photographer who could fix my mistakes for $500. She wanted me to send her all the raw files so this other person could edit them instead. I was honestly hurt. These weren't even bad photos. The lighting was a little dim in a few shots because the venue was dark, but nothing that couldn't be fixed in editing. That's literally what editing is for. But here's where it gets really messed up. When I hesitated about sending the raw files, Jake stepped in and said they

Step 3 Roblox wrecking ball. I made a new game just for him. Private server, custom map. Looked like his childhood bedroom, except the walls bled and every NPC whispered give it back Ethan! Even his Avatar looked like him, but melting. He joined, lasted 13 seconds before logging out. Blocked me, but I had already planted something special. Step 4 real life payload. I emailed his church.

But her face immediately dropped when she realized that we tricked her. My sister in law Maya has always been competitive with me since the day I married her brother Jake couldn't handle that someone else was getting attention and what she considered her family. When Jake and I got engaged, she tried to announce her own engagement at our party. When we bought our first house, she suddenly started house hunting, too. So when we both ended up pregnant at the same time, I knew the competition was about to get intense. Maya was due just two weeks before me, and from the moment we announced, she became absolutely obsessed with finding out our baby name choice. At first, it started innocently enough. She'd casually ask during family dinners, have you guys thought about names yet? When we'd discuss, she'd push harder, come on, just give me a hint. But then it escalated. Maya started showing up at our house unannounced, trying to peek at any baby books we had lying around. She'd walk through our nursery and comment on everything, clearly fishing for clues. She even asked my mother in law to pressure us into sharing our choice. The breaking point came when I caught her literally going through our mail. When she thought we weren't looking, she was flipping through baby magazines and pack, desperately searching for any evidence of Our name decision. My husband thought I was being paranoid when I told him I suspected Maya wanted to steal our name and use hers. She wouldn't do that, he said. But I knew better. This is exactly the kind of petty move Maya would pull. That's when I decided to set a trap. I created a Pinterest board filled with names I'd never actually consider using. I strategically left a notebook open on our kitchen counter with final decision written in big letters next to the name Aurora Rose. When Maya came over for dinner, I even coordinated with my mom to call me while Maya was within earshot, having a completely fake conversation about how Aurora fit so perfectly with your family naming tradition. And I'm so excited you finally decided. Maya took the bait completely over the

The bride stopped mid pose. Her photographer looked confused and about 30 wedding guests turned to stare at my three year old daughter Emma standing by the playground swings. I was mortified. Emma had this habit of saying random things loudly at the worst possible moments, but this was next level embarrassing. Emma, honey, let's go play on the slides, I whispered, trying to drag her away from the wedding party, but she wasn't having it. She broke free from my grip and marched right up to the bride, tugging on her dress. Lady, don't marry the mean man, I said, pointing directly at the groom. He's gonna hurt you. Everyone went dead silent. The groom's face went red and he started walking toward us looking angry. Hey, what kind of kid says something like that? What are you teaching her? I started apologizing, explaining that Emma was just 3 and had an active imagination. But then the bride knelt down to Emma's level and asked quietly, sweetie, why do you think he's mean? Emma pointed to a bruise on the bride's wrist that was barely covered by her dress sleeve. My mommy had marks like that when the bad man lived with us. She cried at night, too, just like you smell like tears under your makeup. My heart stopped. This kid had been through way too much for her age, but she developed this Weird ability to spot things adults tried to hide. When my ex was still around, Emma would always know when I'd been crying, even if I thought I'd covered it up perfectly.

I hated the idea of my 17 year old daughter dating anyone. But when she brought home this boy named Pete, I lost it. He had a motorcycle, tattoos and that smug smile that made me want to run his name through the system. I made it my mission to break them up. I'd randomly show up at places they hung out, flash my badge around and remind Pete that I knew how to make bodies disappear. But this kid never flinched. He just smile and say, have a good day, sir. When he came for dinner the first time, I placed my gun on the table next to my plate. My wife kicked me under the table but I didn't care. Pete just looked at it and said, Nice Glock 19, sir.

I'd have him help me with the most backbreaking chores I could think of. Reshaping the roof in July, digging out a tree stump by hand, moving every piece of furniture in the house to steam clean the carpets. This kid never complained. He'd show up at 7:00am sharp already wearing work clothes, even brought his own work gloves. When I try to wear him down with endless tasks, he just say what's next? Sir, one Saturday I had him helping me rebuild the deck. I was being extra harsh, making him redo boards that were perfectly fine. Around noon, my daughter brought us water. As she walked away, I caught Pete watching her. But it wasn't the way most teenage boys looked at girls. He had this soft.

My husband's friend Kate always had to be the main character in every situation. When someone else had good news, Kate suddenly had better news. At group dinners, she'd hijack any conversation within five minutes. I couldn't stand her, but I put up with it because she and Zach had been friends since college. After my husband and I announced our pregnancy at 12 weeks, things with Kate got really weird. Suddenly, Kate was everywhere we went sporting a small baby bump. She showed up at our favorite brunch spot rubbing her belly. She enrolled in our exact prenatal yoga class. She even switched to our OB practice. Nobody questioned it because these things happen and women get pregnant. At the same time, she posted weekly bump photos on Instagram and everyone congratulated her just like they did me. Three months in, one of our friends mentioned something strange at a girl's night. She said Kate's belly looked bigger the previous Tuesday at Book Club than it did at Saturday's barbecue. When she brought it up, Kate burst into tears about how cruel it was to comment on a pregnant woman's body. She went on about water retention and bloating and how pregnant women deal with enough judgment without their friends piling on. Our friend felt terrible and apologized profusely while the rest of us comforted Kate. After that night, nobody dared mention anything about her appearance again, even, even though I Started noticing her bump size seemed to fluctuate, too. That's when things got uncomfortable. Kate started making comments about how wild it was that we got pregnant around the same time. She'd joke about our babies being best friends, maybe even more than friends someday. Then the jokes got stranger, like when she said pregnancy brain made her forget exactly when she conceived. And wasn't it funny how close our due dates were? She started showing up at every single appointment Zach and I had. Always in the waiting room when we arrived.

When I was 13, I had zero confidence and no real friends. So the only person I ever hung out with was this 18 year old dude who thought he was God's gift to women. He was one of those guys who only felt important when he was putting others down. And since I didn't have anyone else, I just tolerated it. He'd constantly make jokes about me in front of people and I'd laugh it off because I didn't want to lose the only person who'd hang out with me. His favorite obsession, girls. But here's the thing, all the girls his age completely ignored him. So whenever we were out, he'd invite girls my age to tag along just to show off. One day two girls who were best friends came with us. They were clearly into him, giggling at everything he said and he was soaking it up. One of them even had her head on his shoulder while he played the cool older guy. Eventually he turned his attention back to me and did his usual routine, said my acne looked like a game of Connect 4 and that my hair made me look like toad from Mario Kart. The girls were dying of laughter. I just looked at him and said, that's your idea of being funny, clowning your own friend to impress a girl? That's kind of sad. He smirked and said, ah, did I hurt your Feelings, relax, man. I get it. You're just jealous cause girls don't like you. Maybe go hit on that one across the street. And pointed across the street at an old lady in a wheelchair. Without missing a beat, I shrugged and said, nah, I like girls my age. She's probably still too young.

We were talking about future plans, her sister's wedding next summer where I was supposed to be her plus 1. Then on a random Thursday evening, she sat me down for the talk. I love you, but I'm not in love with you anymore. She said, I think we should transition to being friends, get along so well, have the same friend group. We'd make amazing friends but not amazing partners. Here's what killed me, she said. All this while already having packed a bag. Her friend Marissa was picking her up in an hour. She planned this whole thing down to having somewhere to stay already got an exit strategy. I said, we're adults, we're friends. We can make this work. I sat there processing two years living together, talking about kids someday. Now she wants to be buddies. Okay, I said, yeah, let's be friends. She actually smiled, relieved, like I just agreed to her perfect plan where she gets to dump me but keep all the benefits of having me in her life. The next morning, I did exactly what Tara asked, treated her like a friend. That's when I Learned she had a very different definition of friendship than I did. First text came at 7:00am. Could you drop Off my work laptop. Sure. I'll leave it at the front desk of your office Monday. Can't you bring it by Marissa's? I need it for the weekend. I've got plans. Monday works better.

I went shopping alone, bought myself the exact dress I'd shown him, got my nails done, and treated myself to dinner at this fancy Italian place downtown. The waiter even brought me free cake when I mentioned it was my birthday. For the next month, every time Danny mentioned his upcoming birthday, I played dumb. When he showed me golf clubs online and said these would be perfect for my birthday, I just said cool and kept folding laundry. When he asked what restaurant we should book for his birthday dinner, I told him I hadn't really thought about it. When he mentioned taking the day off work to celebrate, I said that sounded nice and changed the subject. March 14th arrived. I woke up early, got dressed for work like any normal day, and started making coffee. Danny came downstairs in his favorite shirt, clearly expecting something special. Morning, I said, not looking up from my phone. It's my birthday, he said, waiting for my reaction. I looked up, pretended to think for a second, then snapped my fingers. Oh yeah! Happy birthday, babe. Have a good day at work. His face went through about five different emotions. Confusion, hurt, anger, then this weird panic. That's it? You're not taking the day off? We don't have dinner plans? I shrugged, grabbing my keys. I've been super busy with work stuff lately. Haven't really had time to plan anything. When I got home that night, he was sitting at the kitchen table looking defeated. You really forgot my birthday, he said quietly. I didn't forget, I replied. I just figured if birthdays aren't important enough to remember without reminders, then maybe we shouldn't make such a big deal about them. The realization hit him like a truck. His mouth opened and closed a few times before he finally said, this is about your birthday, isn't it? What about my birthday? I asked innocently. He put his head in his hands. I've been a complete idiot. Yeah, I said, you have been. The next morning I woke up to rose petals leading from our bedroom to the kitchen, where he'd made my favourite breakfast and had a jewellery box sitting next to my coffee. Inside was a necklace that looked exactly like my mom's missing one. I know I can't undo the past three years, he said, but I swear I will never forget again.

Jess came over to my place Friday night, and I could tell something was bothering her by the way she kept sighing. You know what Britney told me today? She said, flopping down on my couch, her boyfriend is so mysterious, and she's obsessed with him. Meanwhile, you texted me 12 times about being nervous for your presentation. The way she said it made me feel like I was some kind of burden. I wish you were more mysterious, more of a challenge. I should have known this would end badly when three weeks later, she'd be crying at my door. But that night, I just felt hurt and said, fine, I'll be mysterious. That night. I usually would have texted her good night, but I didn't, and it felt wrong not doing it. She sent me three question marks right away, and I just wrote back, all good, and left it at that. Saturday morning came, and normally I'd text her about my coffee and ask what she was up to, but I kept my phone in my pocket. By noon, she would texting, you okay? And I just sent a thumbs up, which killed me because I actually wanted to talk to her. Monday was the worst because I got the promotion I've been working for, and all I wanted was to call her. And when we went to dinner that night, She asked about my day, and I just said, same old while scrolling through my phone, even though inside I was bursting to tell her. She leaned across the table trying to figure out what was going on with me. You seem different, she said. Good. Different. And the crazy part was she seemed more into me than she had in months. Made me feel powerful, but also completely hollow inside. The second week, she started showing up at my place without calling first and cooking these fancy dinners, basically doing anything to crack me open. I can't figure you out anymore, she said. Wednesday night, and she sounded excited about it. Britney so jealous, she says. I got the mysterious boyfriend. Jackpot! I wanted to tell her how dumb this whole thing was and how much I missed just talking to her normally, but I just shrugged and kept watching TV. my dad called because my mom was in the hospital for minor surgery and he was freaking out. I spent three hours calming him down while Jess sat next to me trying to figure out what was happening. After I hung up, she asked, is everything okay? And I wanted to fall into her arms and tell her everything. Family stuff. I said instead, it's handled. She kissed me harder than she had in months and whispered, you're so strong. But I wasn't strong at all. I was just pretending. The third, Thursday night at eleven PM, Jess showed up at my door with her makeup running down, her face, shaking

Every Sunday at exactly 4 in the morning, I hear this snip snip snip sound coming from your yard. It wakes up my whole house. I glanced past her toward my front lawn, which looked perfectly normal. Green, well maintained, clear. I cut with a regular mower like every other yard on Oakwood Drive. Missus Peterson, I use a gas mower on Saturday afternoons. You've seen me do it dozens of times. Her expression shifted from annoyed to confused as she followed my gaze to the obviously machine cut grass. But the sound is definitely coming from your property. My husband heard it, too. What exactly does it sound like? I asked, being outside in my pajamas to get a better view of my yard. Missus Peterson made a cutting motion with her fingers, like someone trimming hedges, but rhythmic snip snip snip for hours. I walked around to my backyard, with her following close behind, both of us scanning for anything unusual. That's when I saw them. Tiny, perfect circles cut into the grass near my back fence, about six inches in diameter. Not random patches, but Precise geometric patterns carved into the lawn with surgical precision. Missus Peterson, I didn't do this. My voice came out smaller than intended. The circles formed a complex design that would have taken hours to create with Scissors. And I've been found asleep every Sunday at 4:00am for the past month. I pulled out my phone and took photos of each circle, documenting the strange pattern while Missus Peterson watched nervously. The cuts were too

Four hours later, I watched a confident woman in designer jeans and a cashmere coat rush through the arrivals gate, scanning the crowd.

It started when I wore a tank top and shorts to the grocery store on a 90 degree day. You're not leaving the house dressed like a SLT, my dad said. While I was grabbing my car keys, I looked down at my completely normal summer outfit. Cover yourself up, because I'm not having my daughter walking around looking like she's for sale, he continued, his face red with anger. I went back upstairs and changed into jeans and a hoodie despite the heat, and he nodded approvingly while saying this was about respect and dignity. That night, I did some online shopping with his credit card since he cared so much about my clothing choices. Thank you for helping me understand modesty, I said the next morning, wearing a full length denim dress that covered everything except my hands and face. He seems. Until we got to his office barbecue, where everyone kept asking if I was feeling okay and why I was dressed for winter. She's exploring modest fashion, he explained uncomfortably, while his co workers exchanged concerned looks and I stood there sweating through three layers of fabric. Monday I wore a beekeeper suit to school because dad had been very clear about covering up and protecting myself from unwanted attention. The principal called him within an hour asking if everything was alright at Home and whether I was being forced to wear extreme religious garments. It's just a phase, my dad told them. But I made sure to explain loudly in the main office that my father said my body was shameful and needed to be completely hidden from men's eyes. The counselor started taking notes while my dad's face turned purple. Tuesday brought his important client dinner at the country club. When I arrived in a full burka, I ordered express shipping from Amazon. This is our daughter, my dad said weekly, as his Japanese investors stared in complete confusion. They kept asking questions about our family's religious beliefs and whether this was common in American households, while I sat silently eating through my face covering. His biggest client pulled him aside to discuss their concerns about doing business with someone who had such extreme views about women. And I heard my dad desperately trying

I've been planning Miranda's dream Valentine's Day for weeks. When she destroyed me over brunch, I just pulled out my phone to confirm the reservation at the restaurant she'd been dying to try when she interrupted me. God, you're so clingy and needy. We need to talk, she said, pushing away the flowers I brought. I can't do this anymore. It's suffocating. We're always trying to be romantic, always wanting to do couple stuff. My heart broke. We're about to be a year, Miranda. Exactly why we need to set boundaries now. From now on, we're best friends who happen to sleep together. Treat me exactly like you treat Nate or will. No flowers or special treatment, just buddies. I'm just someone you have sex with. She said it like I was pathetic for wanting more. The couple next to us looked horrified. If that's what you want, I said quietly. She rolled her eyes. Fine. Finally, maybe now you'll stop being so desperate and embarrassing. Valentine's Day arrived, Miranda texted asking about if we had plans. I responded that I was going to Nate's to watch the game. She could come if she wanted. Dead silence for an hour. Didn't we have a reservation? She finally asked. Reminded her that I don't make romantic reservations for my buddies. That night, she showed up at Nate's in a red dress and heels. I handed her A beer without looking up from the TV and went back to the game. When she, she tried to sit next to me on the couch. I pointed to the recliner across the room. Dude, you're blocking the TV. Nate looked confused. Miranda's face went red. She spent the night watching us play video games and talk about sports. Her birthday came three weeks later. I got her what? I got all my bros, a six pack of beer and Buffalo wings from the sketchy place near campus. She stared at the grease stained container like it was radioactive. Where's my actual gift, she asked, voice shaking. That is your gift? Same thing I got will last month. Pretty good wings, too. But I'm your girlfriend. No, you're my friend who I occasionally sleep with. Your exact words. She didn't speak to me for two days. The real entertainment started at her company Spring Gala. She begged me to come, bought me a suit and said it was important for her promotion. When her boss approached asking how long we've been together, I corrected him immediately. Oh.

My wife in her professional ballet costume from the City Ballet Company. Our wedding photo where she wore point shoes under her dress. And finally, my wife's obituary from six months ago, listing her as a former principal dancer who'd performed at Lincoln Center. The owner's face went white. The two mothers behind her stepped back. I wasn't finished. I. I explained how my wife made me promise on her deathbed to let Lily dance. How I worked double shifts at the factory to afford classes my wife would have taught for free. How my in laws call every Sunday to watch Lily's videos because it's the. The only way they can still see their daughter's Grace in this world. Then I asked if she'd like to explain to a grieving five year old why she can't dance like mommy anymore. The next morning, the studio sent an email to all parents about their new inclusive family policy and mandatory sensitivity training for staff and parents. Four families withdrew their children in protest, but seven new families enrolled. After hearing our story on the local news, the instructor personally apologized and now saves the front row seat for me every week. She also started incorporating some of my wife's choreography into the classes. My neighbor brought Me coffee last Tuesday and sits with me now admitting she was ashamed of how she'd acted. Lily has made three new best friends. And last week she whispered that she thinks Mommy would be proud of her grand jays taste. I know she would be.

No trying too hard. Dan, so lucky to have found a natural beauty. I laughed it off, but Ben kept going. Seriously, do you have any single friends who don't cake on makeup? I'm so tired of these Instagram filter girls. Within a week, two other guys from Dan's office had asked him if I had single sisters or friends who were natural like me. One even said his ex wore so much foundation she looked like a different person without it. But I was refreshingly real. I watched Dan's jaw clench every time someone complimented my natural look. The irony was suffocating. He stripped away something that made me feel confident only to have other men praise the result. I felt like a trophy he couldn't decide whether to display or hide. That's when Dan's whole tune changed. Suddenly, he was buying me makeup for no reason. Not just any makeup, expensive stuff. You should wear this to dinner tonight, he'd suggest, holding up some bold lipstick. When I reminded him he used to hate when I wore makeup, he got defensive. I never said that.

And that one influencer who talks about their symptoms in a story time? Definitely not a doctor. When everyone just casually slaps a label on themselves, it waters down the real struggles people actually face. Like someone living with legit OCD is out here battling life every day and then some dude is like oh my god I'm so OCD I color code my closet. No, you're not OCD, you're just organized my guy. And even with depression, just because you're feeling a little sad one week does not mean you have depression. Unless you're diagnosed, I don't want to hear it.

I'm a court reporter and last month I witnessed the most hilarious custody hearing of my career. The Johnsons were divorcing and fighting over custody of their ten year old son, Max. Both parents kept interrupting each other with accusations. Mom, he never helps with homework. Dad, she who lets him eat candy for breakfast. Mom, he bought Max a motorcycle. Dad, it was a bicycle with a motor sound. Judge Johnny was getting fed up. I'd like to speak with Max privately. Max walks in wearing a tiny suit and carrying a briefcase. This kid came prepared. Judge Johnny tries not to smile. Max, that's quite an outfit. Thank you, your honor. I believe proper courtroom attire shows respect for the legal process. Can you tell me about living with your parents? Max opens his briefcase and pulls out a folder. I've prepared a presentation. A presentation? Yes, sir. I call it why my parents are both crazy and I should live with my grandma. Judge Johnny nearly chokes. Excuse me. Max pulls out a poster board with charts and graphs. I've been documenting evidence for three months, your honor. What kind of evidence? Let's start with exhibit A. Max holds up a photo. This is my dad trying to cook dinner. He set the smoke alarm off so many times that the Fire Department knows our address by heart. Exhibit B, my mom's attempt at helping With my science project, she glued her hand to the volcano, and we had to go to the emergency room. Exhibit C. Dad's brilliant idea to teach me to drive in the Walmart parking lot. I was 8, your Honor. 8. Exhibit D. Mom signed me up for competitive ballroom dancing. I'm 10 years old, and I know the tango better than my multiplication tables. Judge Johnny is biting his lip to keep from laughing. Max, what would you like to happen? I'd like to live with Grandma Rose. She's the only adult in my family who hasn't tried to kill me through incompetence. Max pulls out another photo. This is from Dad's attempt to build me a treehouse. It's currently hanging upside down from the tree. How is that even possible? Dad says he followed the instructions backwards. I don't know what that means. The judge calls the parents back in. Max has made some very interesting points. Mom, what did he say? He's prepared a very thorough case for why he should live with his grandmother. Max stands up. Your honor, may I present exhibit E. Max, hold up a jar. This contains all the vegetables dad has successfully made me eat in the past year. The jar is empty. And this contains all the vegetables grandma has made me eat. This jar is full of little paper vegetables with dates. She makes them fun. Dad just puts them on my plate and says, eat or die. Dad, I never said eat or die, Max. You said eat or starve, which is basically the same thing. Mom. What about me, Max? Mom, you forgot to pick me up from school so many times that Mrs. Peterson keeps a sleeping bag in her office just for me. That was only three times this month, mom. Three times this month. Judge Johnny is openly grinning. How often do you see your grandmother? Every day after school. Because that's where I go when mom forgets to pick me up and dad is running late. And how do you feel about living there? Grandma Rose has never set anything on fire, forgotten to pick me up, or tried to teach me inappropriate life skills. Plus, she has cable and lets me stay up until 8:30 on weekends. Judge Johnny starts laughing. Did you prepare this presentation by yourself? Yes, sir. Grandma helped with the poster board, but all the evidence is mine. What do you think would be fair for your parents? Max thinks seriously. Supervised visitation. Maybe they can take parenting classes. The judge looks at the parents. Your son makes valid points. I'm awarding temporary custody to the grandmother with supervised visitation pending completion of parenting classes. Max pumps his fist. Yes! As we're leaving, I hear Max tell his parents, don't worry, I still love you both. You're just really bad at being adults. The kid's going to be a lawyer someday. Or a judge.

I'm scrolling through my phone, fighting to stay awake, when the store phone rings at exactly 3:00am. Nobody calls the store at that time. Ever.

On the fourth ring, this tiny voice comes through the speaker. Female, soft, shaking. She sounds young, maybe my age or younger. Please, I need help. I'm in a blue house, corner of Langdon and fifth. He's asleep. I can't move my legs. I think he drugged me. My blood goes cold. I'm grabbing a pen, trying to write down the address, but before I can say anything back, the line goes dead. Just silence. I immediately dial 9 1 1. The dispatcher picks up and I'm talking fast, trying to explain what just happened. Give her the address. Corner of Langdon and fifth. Blue House. Girl in trouble, possibly drugged, guy asleep. The dispatcher sounds skeptical, like she's dealing with another late night false alarm. She keeps asking me questions. What's your relationship to the caller? Are you sure about the address? Can you verify this information? I'm getting frustrated because every second we're talking, this girl could be in more Danger. But I answer everything I can, and the dispatcher finally says she'll send a unit to check it out. Five minutes later, I see red and blue lights pull up outside. Two cops come into my store. One of them talks to me while the other stays by his car. The officer asks me to repeat everything I heard, writing it all down. But I can tell he thinks this might be nothing. Maybe a prank call or a misunderstanding. They leave with lights off, no sirens. I'm watching them drive toward Langdon Street through the big windows. My shift is supposed to end at 6 a m, but I can't concentrate on anything. Keep thinking about that girl's voice. How scared she sounded. 20 minutes pass. Feels like hours. Then the same cop car comes back, but this time there's an ambulance following behind. And a second police car. I see them pull someone out, wrapped in a blanket. Even from across the parking lot, I can see she's crying. The officer who talked to me earlier comes back inside. His whole attitude is different now. He looks shaken up. He tells me they found her exactly where I said. Blue House, corner of Langdon and 5th. Door was unlocked. Guy inside was passed out drunk. The girl was on a couch in the living room, hands tied behind her back. Couldn't feel her legs. Turns out the man had multiple warrants for assault and kidnapping. They arrested Him on the spot.

I don't feel that I'm doing anything wrong. Martin and his wife set up a free water stand in front of their house as a goodwill gesture. What's up, Larry? Hey, Dave. Inviting neighbors, kids and delivery drivers to stop by every day to grab a cold one, what do you think about David giving out free water? I think it's fantastic. I figured what, what better way to be an asset to the community than cold water? The free water stand was such a hit, the Martins kept it going. Thank you. Stocking up on water while paying for most of it out of their own pocket. Some neighbors have also stepped up to help. Every year, I'm sure I get about 30 or 40 flats of water. Sometimes I open the front door and there's two flats. I don't know who dropped them off. It's just a surprise and it's fun. But the goodwill gesture appears to have hit a snag. Back in may, the Martins received a notice from FS Residential. Artons were cited for storing items in Plain View and were fined $50. The fines were increased to $100 a month in June, July and August. It's absolutely asinine. I, I don't understand. I'm sorry. I don't care that it, it's blue and gray and my house is tan and brown. It's a water cooler with cold water for the community. Mark.

I left without a word, locked all the cards and changed the locks. But then something happened that no one expect. The nurse handed me my release papers with a smile. You're good to go, Mister Hayes. Three nights post procedure, chest still aching. And not one visit from my wife, Claire. She said hospitals stressed her out, right. The cab pulled into our driveway. Claire's car was parked crooked, like she'd landed in a hurry. The house was dark, except for a low glow upstairs. I didn't call out. I climbed the stairs, pushed our bedroom door, and there they were. Claire and a man I didn't recognize, angled in our sheets. Our wedding photo, watching from the nightstand. I stood there for 10 seconds. No sound, no scene. Just a decision. I walked back down, slid into the same cab, and told the driver to keep going downtown instead of home. My lawyer, Carl, had his reading glasses on. When I walked in, wearing a hospital hoodie. He blinked. You were supposed to be in recovery another day. Plans changed. I laid out the facts. No shouting, no drama. Just a puzzle that finally made sense. You want a divorce? He asked. Yes. But I want more than that. I pulled a folder from my bag. Deeds, account lists, proof I'd already restructured the Business into a trust. Carl flipped pages, eyebrows climbing. You've already moved everything? Everything. By nightfall, she wouldn't even have a key that worked. The locksmith met me before sunset. New locks on every door. Garage codes reset. Security profile updated so Claire would be flagged as unauthorized. I closed the joint account and shifted the balance to the account she didn't know existed. I ended the lease buy back on her SUV with one phone call gone before dinner. I waited across the street in Carl's SUV with two coffees. When Claire and her guy came up the walk, the key turned and hit metal. She pounded. Tom! Tom, open the door! This isn't funny. Her lover tried to look tough. Yo, open up, man. We're not here to fight. I sipped my coffee and told Carl, let's go. We rolled away while she slumped onto the porch and he paced, phone in hand. No sympathy. Just clarity. The next morning, I sat at a hotel patio sipping coffee. 10 missed calls from Claire on my phone. I logged into Carl's client portal instead. The filings were in divorce draining order, civil recovery video from the home security system attached. She hadn't even closed the blinds. Claire had siphoned thousands from our joint savings, some of it from my VA disability benefits. Carl's note was simple. She'd repay or face charges. Her lover's name was on a few transfers to. Rookie mistake. Then the professional fallout. Claire worked part Time and admin at the college. The guy Matt, was a tenured professor. I sent a clean, documented report to Title 9. Proof of misconduct on campus. The reply came fast forwarded to academic integrity and HR. Claire texted, please, can we just talk? Everything's gotten out of control. We didn't mean to hurt you like this. They never mean the part where you're bleeding. I drove to the last place that needed the truth. Her parents house. Cynthia answered with,

She could do way better than you. I shut him down in front of everyone. She snapped, apologize or we're over. I smiled. I didn't say a word. But when she came home weeks later, she finally Learned what done really means. I'm a lawyer. Anna was a paralegal with law school dreams. Three years in, I paid the bills, restored the house and funded her future. The static in the background had a name, Leo. College, best friend, artist, chronically broke. To Anna, he was family to me. A leech in a vintage jacket. He specialized in poison. Dressed as nostalgia. Plan a trip. He'd sigh about some spontaneous camping night they shared. If I pushed back, she'd say, he's just being Leo. He was there for me when Alex shattered my heart. He's family, Jack. I waited. People hand you the rope if you let them. The rope came at a dinner I hosted to celebrate the biggest win of my career. My friends filled the table. Anna invited hers. Leo drank my wine and lectured the room about creators versus suits. It's just a different way of seeing the world. Some of us are driven by passion. Others are more practical. Then he turned to Anna. I just hope you're happy, Anna. I mean, Jack's a great guy. He's stable. He's a provider. He's reliable. He smirked at me, but you've got to admit, she could do way better than you. Silence. I set down my fork. That's a bold claim. Leo, I'm interested in your reasoning, in your expert opinion. What does a better man for Anna look like? Please be specific. Uh, well, you know, someone more on her level, a creative, someone who gets her. I see. So the main qualification is being a creative. And you see yourself as fitting this description. I think I understand her better than anyone. Let's talk about something more concrete than vibes. Let's talk about investment. I laid out facts. The top tier law school I'm paying for, the safe car I bought her. The household account, my income that covered his convertible repairs three times in six months. The mortgage I pay while he's been late on rent, enough that Anna covered him again with my money. Jack, don't do this, Anna whispered. I finished. A man who provides a home, a car and a fully funded education versus a financial black hole draining her resources while trying to sabotage us. Leo stared at his plate. My friends stared at him. Anna shot up, chair scraping. I cannot believe you just did that. You humiliated him in front of everyone. He humiliated himself. Anna, I just presented the evidence. Apologize to him, she snapped. Right now. Apologize. Apologize or we are over. I gave her a small final smile. I didn't say a word. I carried my glass to the kitchen. Case closed. They left together. That night, she moved In with him, she expected rage, then pleading, then compromise. I went dark. Two weeks, no calls, no texts, no mediators. Just work. I boxed her things. Methodical, not angry. Change the locks, reset the codes. Then two calls. First to her law school's dean. The private scholarship fund I'd set up for her tuition dissolved effective immediately. Second, to my managing partner. The summer internship I'd arranged rescinded due to an irreconcilable conflict of interest, not revenge. Alignment. She'd delivered a verdict. I matched it with consequences. Exact.

Her name is Mia O'Brien. She was studying law at the university of Liverpool and had flown to Dubai to visit a friend and her friend's boyfriend. Police ended up raiding the apartment she was staying in and found 50 grams of cocaine, which is worth about 30 four hundred dollars. And since all three were present in the apartment, all three were arrested and charged. And what's the punishment for being a convicted drug dealer in Dubai? A life term. After a one day trial, spoken fully in Arabic with no translator, Mia Learned her fate after the trial was over, 25 years in prison and a 136 thousand dollar fine. O'Brien has been sent to Dubai Central Prison, which apparently is a, quote, hell hole where rape and assault is an everyday occurrence. The prison is known for being overcrowded, having brutal guards and inhumane conditions. Last year the Human Watch organization stated that both male guards and male inmates were permitted access to attack the female inmates.

For 10 days she was missing. Her family was 100% sure she had been trafficked and then she shows up on the side of the road literally clinging to life, unconscious, broken spine, broken arms, broken legs, broken collarbone and scalped. She awoke from her coma and is telling her story and it's beyond comprehension. Her name is Maria Kovalchuk. She's a 21 year old Ukrainian only fans model and she nearly lost her life at the hands of extremely wealthy men. Okay, first of all, Porta potty parties are real, not some urban myth. They are real and they are horrific. If you don't know what they are, it's a party held by these very, very wealthy men who are into humiliating, degrading and abusing women and they will pay these young beautiful women sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars for one night of torture. Mariah attended one of these parties and apparently made these already vile men mad when she refused to participate in whatever they were asking her to do. So they stole her passport and her cell phone. She was able to escape to a nearby construction site, but they found her, kidnapped her and for 10 days abused her beyond comprehension. The Dubai Police said her injuries were consistent with a fall and claim that she must have tried to end her own life by jumping off A ledge at this construction site. Her doctors, however, said her injuries were consistent with being beaten for days and then thrown out of a moving vehicle. The Dubai Police covered all of her expenses and hospital bills with the understanding that she would not speak poorly about how they handled the investigation. Oh, and the men that did this to her were released from custody and will face no charges.

I've been trapped in the school for two years. It started with a stupid prank. I put a fake spider on Mrs. Caldwell's desk with a note that said, Happy Halloween. She didn't think it was funny. Three hours of after school detention, she said. Clean the whiteboards, organize supplies. Think about my choices. That was October 31st, 2022. I haven't been home since. My name is Tyler, and I'm 15 years old. Or I was 15. I don't know what I am now. First day went normal. I scrubbed marker stains off whiteboards while Mrs. Caldwell graded papers. At four PM sharp, she stood up, gathered her things, and headed for the door. I'll see you tomorrow, Tyler, she said, flicking off the lights. Same time, I grabbed my backpack and followed her out. But the classroom door slammed shut behind me. The hallway was empty, silent. When I. I tried the exit doors, they were locked. Every single one. Front entrance, back exits, even the emergency doors. All sealed tight. I banged on the glass until my fists hurt. But the parking lot was empty. My phone showed no signal. The school Wi-Fi required a password I didn't have. By six PM, panic set in. My parents would be expecting me home for dinner. They'd call the school, realize something was wrong. Someone would come looking. Nobody came. As darkness fell, I heard the first sound. A low, scraping noise from somewhere deep in the building. Like fingernails dragging across concrete. Then footsteps in the hallway above me. Slow and deliberate. I hid in the bathroom until morning, listening to things moving through the school all night. Doors opening and closing. Whispered conversations in languages I couldn't understand. And once, something heavy being dragged across the floor. When sunrise came, I must have passed out from exhaustion. I woke up in a small, windowless room I'd never seen before. Grey concrete walls, a single light bulb. A mattress on the floor. A tray of food sat by the door. Cafeteria pizza that was somehow still warm. A note was tucked under the. Welcome to Extended Learning, Tyler. Your education continues. That night, the room's door unlocked automatically. I was free to roam the school. But leaving was impossible. Every exit remained sealed. The windows were too high and reinforced with metal mesh. The staff was still there, but wrong. Mrs Caldwell worked in her classroom every night, grading this

I repeated her exact words from January 15th, including her coffee order she'd mentioned that morning and the phone call with her sister she'd taken during lunch. She went pale and called my parents. Testing revealed I have what researchers call phonographic memory. Like photographic, but for audio. My brain stores conversations with perfect fidelity, including tone, emotion, and background noise. I can tell you what song was playing in the grocery store during a conversation from 2,015.

Imagine never being able to forget a single fight, harsh word, or careless comment. I could replay every I love you, but also every lie. My freshman year roommate moved out after I accidentally repeated a private phone call she'd had with her mom about her eating disorder. I hadn't meant to eavesdrop.
