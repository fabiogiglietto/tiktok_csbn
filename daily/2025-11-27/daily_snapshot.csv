At a George's supermarket, Stephanie Bar and her son Philip are attempting to get three full carts of grocery and pay nothing by using a combination of paper and electronic coupons. Even though she miscalculated her pre coupon total by over $50, she is still confident that her store card and coupons will bring the price down to zero. Alright, and um. Here's my first store card. Alright. Your total after your card is 4 61. 35. I don't think I did very good. I don't see a lot of my equipment that I've already loaded to my card. Some of Stephanie's electronic coupons will not register. This could mean she will fail at reaching her goal of a zero dollar checkout. With the e coupons not coming off, I imagine my total to be about 35 to 40 dollars. Now. The only way for Stephanie to salvage this trip is to make sure every one of her paper coupons scans correctly. And this is my stack of coupons right now. I'm. I'm watching to make sure that when she scans one coupon, she has the right amount coming off and that it actually pulls off with the total.

But once he pulled her out, he realized she was nothing more than a doll. He didn't know whether to laugh or cry, and he and his coworker continued their commute to the mall. Along the way, he casually wiped the doll dry and picked up a necklace lying beside her. The moment he touched it, the doll transformed into a real woman, but as soon as he set it down, she turned back into a doll. When he arrived at his workshop, stared at the doll's stunning features, secretly wishing she could become real. After checking to make sure no one was nearby, he couldn't resist leaning in for a quick kiss, and he went back to sorting the merchandise and absent mindedly removed the doll's necklace. Jesse, who had slept for a thousand years, suddenly awoke. She let out a sneeze, startling Jason so badly he tumbled onto the floor. Jesse, however, was thrilled because Jason looked exactly like her prince from a millennium ago. Just then, several workers from the delivery truck showed up. Jesse immediately froze, pretending to be a lifeless doll. After confirming the doll wasn't damaged, they left without suspicion. Jesse's stomach suddenly growled, so Jason drove her out to get food. She gazed at the world a thousand years later, amazed by everything around her. She even began eating enthusiastically.

He could pull treasures from his dreams directly into the real world. With this incredible gift, he amassed an enormous fortune. But a terrifying beast relentlessly hunted him through every dream, and each time he barely escaped back into reality. Yet this particular dream heist went terribly wrong. Just as he was about to seize all the cash, a grotesque monster materialized behind him and slammed him to the floor. Mike scrambled to his feet, battling the creature while desperately shoving money into his bag. And with a sharp kick, he sent the monster stumbling away. Then he used his mind to vacuum the remaining bills into his grasp, escaping the dream world only seconds before the Beast could grab him, bringing the cash into reality with him. That night, he instantly became the richest man alive, using crates of money to attract multiple girlfriends. But even with a life of absurd luxury, he still felt unsatisfied. He ventured into a cavern overflowing with treasure, his gaze locked onto a priceless golden belt around the waist of an old man sitting in the shadows. Mike lunged forward, ripping the belt straight from the old man's body. The elder burst into rage, and with a single finger pressed to Mike's chest, Mike realized the danger in an instant and fled for his life.

Then the doctor knocked out all of his teeth. After that, he was pushed together with a small cart into a massive shrinking chamber. Once he was settled inside, the doctor slowly closed the chamber door. Using a special key, the doctor activated the machine. Next, he set the internal temperature to 200 degrees. 30 minutes later, the door opened again. This procedure could reduce a normal adult to 1/200 of their size in an instant. To address Earth's overpopulation crisis, a doctor created this shrinking technology. It could compress an ordinary person to just 10 cm tall. This would drastically ease the pressure caused by overcrowding. Miniature residents produced in four years less trash than a full sized human generated in a single day. More importantly, in this tiny world, one thousand dollars held the value of 10 million. 1,000 square meter luxury villa cost only $99. As a poor man, he was naturally tempted by such an irresistible offer. So the next day he took his wife to visit the miniature paradise. They planned to undergo the shrinking procedure together. Before the process began, every bit of body hair had to be removed. Next, all their teeth had to be extracted. Teeth don't shrink. If left in, they would explode inside the skull. After completing all preparations, they too were pushed into the enormous shrinking chamber.

Seeing no one notice, he quickly scooped the ash out, smeared it onto the wall and carried the soup to the dining table. The waiter behaved even worse. While serving drinks, his fingers were dipped directly inside the glasses. The chopsticks were never washed. He simply wiped them with a filthy cloth. Leftover bones were tossed onto the floor, turning the place into a paradise for stray dogs. When a customer asked for toilet paper, the waiter threw over two towels dirtier than grease rags. Worst of all, a cockroach was found soaking in the duck soup. One customer finally reached his limit and confronted the owner. The owner shamelessly insisted it was a red date and even popped the cockroach into his mouth to prove his point. Furious, the customer grabbed the bowl, ready to send it for testing. Fortunately, the chef reacted fast and splashed oil on the ground. The customer slipped, the bowl shattered, and all evidence vanished. The roast duck shop narrowly escaped disaster this time, but trouble was destined to find them. One day, the health department received a complaint and came to investigate. The inspector discovered roast ducks placed directly on newspapers, dishes coated with grime, and employees who never washed their hair nor trimmed their nails. In the end, the inspector merely issued a fine and whenever a new body was delivered to the morgue.

Using a delivery truck as temporary cover, Jackie seized the brief opening to slip away unseen. The thugs crawled across the ground, searching, yet still failed to track them down. Just as the pursuers were about to give up and sweep another area, Jackie caught the gaze of one of them through the rearview mirror. Reacting instantly, he yanked open the canvas hood, slamming the thug against the side of the truck. They turned and tried to escape quietly, only to run straight into another enemy lurking around the corner. Jackie handed over his pistol to divert the attacker's attention, though the weapon was completely empty. More reinforcements arrived, forcing them to flee again until they hit a dead end. He lifted the reporter onto the top of an iron gate, then squeezed himself through the bars at the very last moment, finally shaking the mob, at least for now. After rescuing this complete stranger, he simply nodded goodbye and the two parted ways. But the thugs climbed over the gate, still determined to hunt Jackie down. I don't even know her, he muttered.

Ten years later, those children have become highly capable operatives. Each one developed a unique specialty. Some became masters of disguise, others experts in altering their appearance and some could even switch genders flawlessly. Behind them stands a formidable tech support team with the Wolf King pulling the strings from the shadows, making their entire operation almost unstoppable. Ordinary officers don't stand a chance against them. But this time they ran into him. After picking up the Wolf King's trail, he assigned a female officer to tail the target.

Facing my questions, the woman showed no remorse. She mocked that I was not good enough for my husband. What did you say? I said that such a scared girl can't have such a handsome husband. And you, pretty girl, huh? As you can see, my name. Fed up with her taunts, I lost control and splashed water in her face. But Jack kept staring at the girl as she walked away. Only our child's crying, snapped Jack back to reality. Are you nuts? You're making a scene on a plane, embarrassing yourself. I felt helpless facing Jack's accusations. But Jack used an apology as an excuse to run after the girl. I didn't think much of it at first. Then the plane hit severe turbulence. Our frightened daughter started crying non stop. But Jack still had not returned. I grabbed our daughter and went to look for him. The bathroom door would not open no matter what I tried. With no choice, I went back to calm the child first. Then I heard strange noises. I yanked the curtain open. What I saw is something I will never forget. Seeing that scene, I was completely done with my husband. I did not shout or make a scene. I just left quietly. But I vowed I would make them pay. Two years later, Jack came to interview for a job. The boss, Bill, seemed very pleased with him. Just when Jack thought he had It someone he never expected showed up. Allow me to introduce you to my wife, Megan. Jack never imagined the woman he once looked down on would now be his boss's wife. Bill sensed the awkwardness. He asked if any of us knew each other. To get revenge, I hid that Jack was my ex husband. And Jack did not reveal my identity because he wanted the job. We all pretended it was our first meeting. When Bill stepped away, Jack finally spoke up. When exactly you gonna destroy me? What are you talking about? I'm talking about that all my future depends on your husband. So you might. Don't worry. I'll praise you. Because it's not your fault, Carl. She took you away from me and destroyed our family. After I told my side, Jack breathed a sigh of relief. Then he blamed his girlfriend. He said she had seduced him. That was why he betrayed me. But I refused to listen to such excuses. You're gonna dump her tonight. What? Here in the restaurant, in front of everyone? Take this glass. You're gonna tell her straight, and you're gonna throw it in her face.

Panicking, she rushed to find a bathroom. But the moment she stepped into the restroom, she froze. The toilet in front of her was as tall as a mountain. With no other choice, she had to climb onto a potted plant to do her business. Then she ran straight into the boys bathroom, begging Jack to turn her back to normal. But Jack said there was no hurry. Breakfast came first. Afraid his dad would notice, Jack casually pressed the teacher between two slices of bread, like making a sandwich. Seeing he was about to be late for a test, he grabbed his bag and rushed to school. On the way, the tiny teacher kept yelling angrily inside the backpack. Jack got so annoyed that he tossed her into a trash bin in frustration. But when he saw the garbage truck approaching, he realized he'd gone too far. He hurried back and rescued her from the pile of trash, then took her to school with him. When they arrived, Jack heard there was a math test that day, so he made a deal with her. You help me pass the exam, and I'll turn you back to normal. During the test, he hid her in his pencil case. The teacher had no choice but to quietly whisper the answers to him. Jack took her to a toy store and bought her a tiny dress as a gift. But the next day, When the test results came out, Jack was completely stunned.

No! Oh, no! The little girl got her clothes caught on a flower pot on the balcony. Terrified, she struggled to break free, only making things more dangerous. SBU detectives rushed to the scene, calming her with words while the rescue team tried to break in and save her. You gotta go away! No! No! No! The girl's name was Maddie. Her mother, Jenny, had left her home alone. The apartment had food and toys, the bathroom door open, the stove unplugged, clear signs that Jenny had tried to take some precautions for her daughter's safety. Police soon Learned that the reason Jenny left Maddie alone for two whole days was because she had been arrested for shoplifting on Maddie's birthday. She wanted a two hundred dollar doll, but Jenny couldn't afford it. Leaving a six year old alone for days. Even after her release, Jenny could face child endangerment charges, so detectives couldn't just hand Maddie back. When asked if her husband Gary could step in, Jenny said no, it wasn't safe. Gary can't be alone with Maddie. He is needs. Investigators dug into the family situation and discovered that Gary was Maddie's stepfather. There's nothing I do to her that she doesn't like. It also became clear that Jenny was likely a victim of domestic abuse. If Jenny were charged with neglect, custody would go to Gary, making things worse for Maddie. The only way forward for Jenny to press charges against Gary as a domestic violence Victim so she and Maddie could finally get the help they needed.

What, what does an 18 year old and a 5 year old have to talk about for three hours straight? I have to peek at the home surveillance footage every day. On this day, I suddenly noticed that my daughter was laughing very happily in the video. She chatted with the nanny for a long time. I curiously asked my daughter about it. She told me it was a secret. Having no other choice, I could only go ask the nanny. Her reply was very natural, but her eyes deliberately avoided mine. I started to suspect her, but I had no evidence. I could only buy a hidden camera to monitor her and my daughter's every moment. Time came to the day of my daughter's performance. The nanny considerately helped her change clothes and encouraged her. I even declined my boss's urgent work request and left work early. But just as I was on my way there, the police suddenly stopped me. I'm gonna need you to pop the trunk and step out of the car, man. What? Why step out of the car? It turned out the nanny had used the surveillance system to trigger a false alarm. By the time I finally cleared up the misunderstanding and rushed to the theater, the performance had long been over. I'm so sorry I, I couldn't get there in time. I can't believe you missed it. I'll go check on her. Hang on, hang on. I thought I told you that she was to play the violin tonight. It wasn't my decision. Missus Gessler, right? I vented all my anger on her and decided to talk to her parents. I used high tech means to locate her parents residence. But the moment I saw her mother, her panicked expression aroused my suspicion. I asked to see her childhood photos. Halfway through flipping through them, I sensed something was wrong. They simply didn't look like father and daughter. As I turned to leave, her mother chased after me. Don't bring her back here. Do you understand? Please, you need to protect her and take care of her. I never could. After returning home, I still decided to fire her. Why did you fire her? She was my best friend. I hate you. When my daughter heard the news, she lost control of her emotions and rushed upstairs. That night, I suddenly realized my daughter was missing. I frantically called the police. The police, however, told me the nanny had no birth records in the hospital's archives. She was only recorded as a Newborn abandoned by her parents. What hospital? Saint Anthony's in Wakefield. I stood frozen in place. I had abandoned a child there. It was a mistake I made when I was young. Realizing the severity of the situation, I rushed home and checked the surveillance footage. On the camera, I saw the nanny crawling out from under my daughter's bed. If you ever want To see your precious daughter again. You'll meet me at your husband's construction site. No police, no Mark, just you.

Al verlo, la mamá Gallina se puso muy nerviosa, corrió de inmediato y jaló la cola del buitre y luego le soltó una serie de golpes, pero su fuerza no era rival para un buitre adulto. En ese momento, el gallo escuchó el alboroto y llegó corriendo y al oír que su hijo había sido llevado al cielo por el buitre, se quitó la ropa capa por capa sin y comenzó a gritar, desafiando al buitre a bajar. Sus gritos despertaron al sheriff de la granja, quien de inmediato sopló su silbato. Al recibir la señal, las golondrinas salieron en tropel y atacaron al buitre por el frente, pero su ataque ligero no le causó un daño real, así que cambiaron de formación y se hicieron un remolino. Y ese tipo de ataque por fin surtió efecto, aunque el buitre tampoco se dejó intimidar. Al ver la formación que habían hecho, se inclinó hacia atrás y como si fuera una bola de boliche los arrolló. Las golondrinas cayeron sorprendidas sin poder reaccionar. Al ver lo fuerte que era el buitre, las gallinas se subieron al gallinero y pusieron huevos sin parar. Cuando los huevos cayeron al canal, los cerditos golpearon las tablas para lanzarlos al cielo. Con esa lluvia de proyectiles, el buitre quedó aturdido por completo y entre ellos había un pájaro carpintero Disfrazado, que le dio un golpe sorpresa en la cabeza, pero ni así lograron derrotarlo del todo. En ese momento, un burrito se asustó con un huevo que le cayó, vio cerca y corrió descontrolado. Al verlo, las golondrinas tuvieron una idea, lo sujetaron mientras corría sin parar y lo llevaron directo detrás del buitre. El burrito dio una poderosa patada. Con esa fuerza tremenda, el buitre terminó cayendo en picada, pero el peligro del pollito aún no había pasado. Como no podía volar, estaba cayendo directo al suelo. En ese instante, el burrito lo vio caer y las golondrinas formaron de inmediato una formación tipo avión y lo atraparon justo antes de que llegara al suelo. Luego escoltaron al pollito de regreso a la granja. Al verlo regresar corriendo, el gallo abrió los brazos, pero el pollito dio un giro y saltó directo a los brazos de su mamá, dejando de lado al desconcertado gallo y subido a la cabeza de la mamá, empezó a piar con fuerza

Then Jenny got out of bed alone. Jack's incompetence made Jenny feel extremely lonely. She badly wished Jack could last longer, just like other men. Later, the lonely Jenny went out to the balcony to relax. She began to crave, pray for a man to care about her. But she didn't notice a man across the way was watching her with binoculars. At that moment, Jenny was daydreaming, dreaming that a man with a strong body would fall in love with her and keep bringing her new excitement. Just then, Jenny saw the man across the street. She knew he was watching her, but Jenny didn't care. She kept riding her body in front of him. Besides this man, Jenny also noticed another guy was watching her, too. This guy was much younger and Jenny liked him better. To please this young guy, Jenny gave him an inviting look to signal him, then kept showing off her body, hoping to win his favor. After both men were satisfied, Jenny stopped what she was doing. Both men said they were very pleased. Then Jenny went back to her room. But she knew she had already stolen the hearts of these two men. Before long, they would definitely Come looking for her.

Just like a group of young people bravely chasing down bad guys, a bunch of young folks set out on a boat for a good time. Just as the fun was getting started, the yacht's engine suddenly stalled. These people floated helplessly on the endless sea. But just one day later, the drinking water on board was running dangerously low. As their strength slowly faded, food and water completely ran out. Suddenly in the distance, they spotted a ship. Joy flooded their hearts. But little did they know their real nightmare was just beginning. As the two boats drew closer, the scarcity of water triggered tension. The sailors hurriedly brought over a bucket of water. The exhausted group started to drink from it. Not long after, a few of their friends collapsed unconscious. The sailors pulled them aboard their ship. Then a chain of atrocities began. One by one, the women were abused. After a while, one woman came to her senses.

The girl ran to the cabin, lifted a seat cushion, and unexpectedly discovered a suspicious weapon. Without pausing to think, she turned, opened the opposite seat, retrieved a towel, closed the box, and headed to the deck. Her mother had already been pulled aboard. She walked over, draped the towel around her mother, relieved to find her unharmed. She turned to return to the cabin to sleep, but was jolted awake by a clamor. She rose to investigate pirates were boarding the ship. She retreated back into the cabin, quietly opened the door, unlock the box, and retrieve the firearms. But when she peered out again, her mother's boyfriend had already fallen overboard and her mother was nowhere to be found. Terrified, she hid back in the cabin. The pirates opened the door and entered the cabin. She curled up in a corner. Fortunately, the pirates glanced around and left. She breathed a sigh of relief, but after they left, she peered out and saw flames through the door crack. Opening the door, she found the entire cabin engulfed in fire. She grabbed a fire extinguisher and fought the blaze all night. Though the fire was extinguished, the ship was badly damaged. Huddled in the corner, she picked up a photo and discovered to her horror that her mother's new boyfriend was part of the pirate crew. That had boarded the ship the night before. She resolved to find and rescue her mother. She went to the deck to assess which equipment remained functional. As she was about to stow the ropes, she unexpectedly discovered her mother's boyfriend entangled in them, having spent the entire night submerged in the sea. She pulled her mother's boyfriend onto the deck, but temporarily bound him, then secretly slipped a knife into her pants. Finally, she used tape to seal the damaged hull and hoisted the spare canvas sail. When her mother's boyfriend awoke, his first concern was her safety. Still pretending to be the good guy, she didn't expose him immediately, instead handing control of the ship over to this suspicious man. She wanted to see what this man was really plotting.

When you go to a concert, he prepares a platinum VIP passage for you. The seats are right above the performance site, and you can even feel the music up close beside the boy band. At this time, Harper's father suggests having a drink with Homer. Mike says that when he's happy, he bangs his head against the wall, and when he's unhappy, he buys a hockey team. Spending money is just a piece of cake for him. He says, I made $80 million today! Bam Bam Bam! Woohoo Bam! Did I make $80 million? On the way home, Homer praises Lisa for making a good friend, but Lisa says, she always interrupts me when I'm talking. Then Harper invites the two of them to another show. They sit in the VIP seats again. The magician asks the two girls what their favorite shows are. Before Lisa can finish speaking, Harper cuts her off. Lisa thinks she is being very impolite. After getting home, Lisa is in a blue mood. She really dislikes the way Harper treats her. At this time, Harper's father invites the Simpson family to his private island for a vacation. Homer tells Mike that the kids have to go to school and can't go on the vacation, and he also invites Mike to have a drink at Moe's. Then the principal calls and tells him that the school will be closed for a week. Homer asks Were you bribed, Seymour? Skinner is not for sale. The bread is in the oven. When the cruise ship docks, Harper and her father come out to greet them. The two girls feel a bit awkward when they meet, but Harper is still very glad that Lisa has come. The three children explore the island. In the evening, Homer comes back from diving in the sea. He shakes his flowing hair to dry it and starts singing beside Mike. At this moment, Lisa comes over and says, Harper turned the tortoise over. But Harper says, this is my island and my tortoise. Lisa really hates Harper's willful personality. Mike wants Lisa to go along with his daughter's wishes, which makes Lisa very sad. Homer looks at the delicious food and his own statue and makes a choice. He says bluntly, Harper is just a spoiled kid. You don't deserve to have a friend like Lisa. I love her the most. She's my sunshine and my everything. There's no need for us to stay with someone who always bosses my daughter around. Let's go, Marge. I just got off. Now, please. You can leave if you want, but you can only take my private plane. Then so be it. On the plane, Lisa is touched by what Homer said. Although Homer pretends not to care on the surface, he's actually reluctant to part with this place in his heart. He says goodbye to it. Goodbye, Bart! Bart! Hahaha!

Frightened, the two sisters set all the cigarettes on fire in one go, and of course, the house caught fire along with them. The sisters made up their minds that they would never smoke again. One day at work, Patty said that she hadn't smoked for a few days, but she kept smelling cigarette smoke and suspected that there was something wrong with her nose. Selma told her to look it up online. Patty found that her symptoms were exactly the same as those described on the internet. This made her feel as if she wouldn't survive until the next day. The doctor said that her test results were fine, and he himself also seemed to smell the cigarette smoke. However, Selma said that she couldn't smell anything at all, but then smoke was coming out of her mouth. It turned out that she had been secretly smoking all the time. Patty was so angry that she decided not to live with Selma anymore. After having a quarrel with Selma, Patty moved to Marge's house. Homer woke up one day and found that Marge wasn't there. He went to the bathroom to look for her. Thinking it was Marge, he took off his clothes and got in. To his shock, it was actually Patty inside. Homer immediately washed his eyes with bleach. When Homer came out, he happened to run into Bart. He quickly poured Bleach on Bart as well? No, I did that with Love, Boy. What's all the hub, bub? Oh, thank you, dad. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. In the evening, Selma came to pay a visit. She was there to apologize to Patty and said that she was willing to give up smoking. The two of them reconciled. Just like that? After getting back home. Cigarette? Yes, together.

Terrence posed as a new resident at the site of Abe. He believed his fifty year manhunt had ended. Instead of arresting Abe directly, he exploited Homer to execute the mission. Terrence took Homer to a bar where he recounted his five decade spy career while drunk. Later, in a private meeting, Terrence revealed the spy he'd chased for 50 years was none other than Abe, Homer's father. Abe never worked, but never lacked money. Photos served as iron clad evidence. Additionally, Homer was never fired for his nuclear plant mishaps. Terrence invited Homer to Springfield Port to witness spy activities. Abe appeared, exchanging canes as if passing Intel, then seeking rewards from a Russian superior.

However, he regretted it before even starting the assembly. After struggling all night, he even got trapped inside the spinning bike. The next day when he woke up, he found that Marge had already finished assembling it. Marge found an online coach for the spinning bike and became obsessed with it, even pedaling in her sleep. Homer believed that Marge had fallen in love with the coach. But I'm married to you, Jessie. Homer. Homer, Homer. I'm married to Homer now. The only exercise Homer wanted to do was lifting a beer mug and Coach Mo would help him with that. That's my little drinker. Homer suspected that his wife was having an affair with the spinning coach. At this time, a group of husbands with the same experience appeared in the bar. The coach began to promote his one on one private lessons to Marge, claiming that the two could ride bikes together and enjoy time in various parts of the world. Aggie tried to stop it, but Marge didn't allow it. Marge lit candles to create a romantic atmosphere and started the private lesson. Just then, Homer came with flowers to make up with Marge, only to find her spending time alone with the coach, which made him very upset. Coincidentally, the pastor knew where the coach lived.

Due to lack of exercise, Homer was almost choked to death by the coach. Therefore, Marge prepared to rescue Homer by positioning him with her phone. But the car wouldn't start. So she got on Lisa's pink bike. Thanks to days of practice, Marge quickly arrived at the coach's house. She found that the so called private lesson of the coach was actually a group class. Angry, Marge kicked the coach to the ground. Finally, the two rode Lisa's pink bike home together. Is that my bike?

Marge and Lisa hide the money left from each shopping trip in a cleaning product can as Lisa's college fund. But one day, all $650 in the can is gone. When the police investigate, they find no signs of a burglary, so the thief must be someone in the family. Anonymous phone call tips off that Marge stole the money for gambling, making her the prime suspect. However, surveillance shows Marge resisted the urge to gamble. The next suspect is Homer Simpson. Lenny reports that Homer owes Moe $600 in beer money, and Moe refuses to serve him more beer. But the police dissected Homer's pants and found no money at all. But Moe, the anonymous tipster, still identified Homer as the thief. However, when the police replayed the recording, they found that Homer never used cleaning agents. Instead, he licked the ketchup clean with his tongue. Meanwhile, Marge believed all family members were innocent. Next, Milhouse appeared and accused Bart, who admitted to taking the money under the sink. He used all the money to make slime toys and sold them at a high price to the Comic Book Guy. Then he put the money back into the cleaning agent jar and recorded a video. The music store owner mentioned that Lisa had recently fallen in love with a new saxophone model, but it turned out she didn't buy it. Case was eventually dropped. Homer suggested celebrating with a drink, and Marge immediately Took out coasters to put under the cups. When Homer asked where she got them, Marge revealed she'd made 1,000 and planned to profit from them, with each costing only 65 cents, so 650 bucks total. Marge also confessed to Homer that she felt insecure, and Homer showed great understanding, so he shifted the blame for the entire thing onto Abe.

He even bought a private pool to make his friends envious. But Marge found his obsequious behavior disgusting. So she called Lisa to help stop Bart and they went to the town hall to file a complaint against the golf club. The result was to target the club. Marge launched an online petition which LED the club to face high tax payments on the other side. Bart was no longer satisfied with flattering small time rich guys and set his sights on the club owner, a capitalist who gave no less than $100 in tips each time. However, Marge's complaint made the golf club's operations difficult. To save his money making job, Bart came up with an idea, classifying the club as a religious institution to avoid taxes. From then on, golf became a religion and the club's huge profits were completely tax exempt. Marge was furious. She found several religious leaders to jointly appeal only to discover that the club was fully equipped, had perfect procedures and complied with all regulations. So they had to admit it was a religion. When Marge saw Bart counting money and tried to persuade him to leave, Bart said he was just biding his time. Later, when Bart flattered the capitalist, the, the other party disdained him and even mocked him as a bootlicker. Although Bart saved the club, Bart left after dropping a harsh word After that, he took a group of companions and drove all terrain vehicles to crazily destroy the golf course, making the club in chaos. When Marge saw this, she was angry on the surface, but secretly happy in her heart. This time the police came. Bart thought he was going to be arrested, but the sheriff wanted to arrest the club owner because his religious members were committing illegal acts.

He aimed the blade right at it, held it steady, grabbed a stone and smashed down hard. The sharp pain knocked him out cold. When he came to, he began opening the boxes, hoping to find something useful. The first held a stack of videotapes. Second had a volleyball. The third had roller skates. He used them to crack open coconuts. Then he found a long dress, tore the bottom to make a fishing net. He caught a tiny fish, but the stench was unbearable. He couldn't eat it at all. So he tried to start a fire with sticks, accidentally cut his hand and in anger, he smashed everything nearby. After cooling off, he noticed the bloody handprint on the volleyball. He drew a face and called it Wilson, sat Wilson next to him and kept trying to light a fire. Maybe from loneliness, he began chatting with Wilson. He tried again and finally saw Smoke Rise. He leaned close and blew hard. Flames burst out. Fire, he shouted. That night, he built a bonfire by the shore, ate roasted crab with his new friend beside him. Four years flew by. He grown used to island life. He could spear fish with perfect aim. Yet the loneliness never left. One day he saw a metal sheet drifting on the waves. It gave him a plan. He chopped trees, tied branches and twisted bark into rope. Even Tore videotapes to make more cord, but it still wasn't long enough. He glanced at Wilson, not wanting to hear that reminder. I know, I know where that rope is, but I'm not climbing back up there. Still, he climbed the cliff and took down the rope once meant for his death. Before leaving, he dressed Wilson up, carve words on the rock and tied Wilson to the raft's bow. He also packed the one box he had never opened before and pushed into the sea. Against the wind and waves, he stayed calm and steady, even cheered Wilson on through the storm. When a massive wave hit, he untied the rope and raised the sail. The raft somehow survived the night. They floated for days, catching rainwater in coconut shells and fishing for food. He probably showed the fish to Wilson. But another storm came. Sail tore away. He held Wilson tight as the raft drifted. When morning came, Wilson was gone, swept into the ocean. He dived in at once and swam hard, but Wilson drifted farther and farther. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Wilson. He crawled back to the raft, heartbroken, threw away the paddle and collapsed. Then out of nowhere, a ship appeared. He raised his arms, finally saved.

The weapon was effective, but the 400,000 strong enemy army under General Musa barely flinched. Determined to take the city before nightfall, Musa gave the order to attack and his command. Waves of horsemen charged forward, loosing volleys of arrows as they rode. But the moment their mounts hit the field of caltrops, chaos erupted. Horses stumbled, riders fell in. The formation broke apart. Still, through sheer numbers, many pressed on, swinging axes and cutting down fleeing soldiers. The defenders, however, were ready. After only a few coordinated volleys, the cavalry was wiped out completely. Before the defenders could catch their breath, Musa ordered his main army to advance. The dark mass of troops rolling forward struck fear into the archer's hearts. Paralyzed by terror, they began to retreat. Victory seemed certain, and Musa's confidence doubled. As the fall of the city appeared inevitable, even the commander atop the city walls believed the battle was lost. But then something impossible happened. Musa noticed movement on Mount BAK. Someone had scaled the mountain. It was the turning point of the entire battle. Furious, Musa ordered his cannons to fire on the ridge. Yet even under the heavy bombardment, no damage could be done. Peering through his spyglass, Musa froze. Standing atop the mountain was the enemy king himself. And in that instant, Musa realized his triumph was about to turn into disaster.

I had chronic neck pain from constantly tensing up around her. I'd stopped going to family events and Tom was getting angry about me isolating myself from his family. I was taking prescription pain killers for the headaches and spending hundreds on chiropractor visits. Denise had literally given me a neurological condition from repeated head trauma. But everyone still acted like I was overreacting to playful affection. The explosion happened at Tom's parents 30th anniversary party. It was a huge event with probably 70 people, including extended family and their friends. I taken preventive pain medication and was trying to stay in crowded areas where Denise couldn't easily reach me. But she was determined to get her hit in. She followed me to the bathroom and waited outside. When I came out, she smacked me so hard I saw stars and stumbled forward into the wall. I heard something pop in my neck and pain shot down my entire left side. That's when Tom's cousin Bradley turned the corner and saw me on the ground holding my neck with Denise standing over me laughing. Bradley helped me up and asked what happened. Denise said, oh, Lucy's being her usual dramatic self, pretending I heard her with a love tap. Bradley looked at her strange and said, I just watched you hit her full force in the head. That wasn't a love tap. That was battery. Denise tried to laugh it Off. But Bradley wasn't having it. He said, actually, I've been watching you do this all night. You've hit her four times already and it's only been an hour. That's not affection. That's abuse. Denise said Bradley was overreacting, too. But then Bradley said something that changed everything. You know what's interesting, Denise, you only hit Lucy. I've been paying attention for the last year and you don't playfully smack anyone else. Not Tom, not your parents, not your kids, not your friends, just Lucy. That's not a quirky personality trait. That's targeted harassment. People started gathering around because Bradley's voice was getting louder. Tom came over asking what was wrong. And Bradley said, your sister has been physically assaulting your wife for years and you've all been laughing about it. I just witnessed her hit Lucy hard enough to injure her neck and she's standing here smiling about it. Mom tried to defend Denise saying it was just how she showed affection. But Bradley pulled out his phone. Actually, I've been recording her doing it all night for evidence. Wanna see the compilation, full story on channel link below.

Then they handed me a folded letter with my name on it. Inside was a legal document titled notice of disownment with their signatures already dry at the bottom. When I asked what this, my mother simply said, you know why? And turned back to taking photos of my brother in his new car. That was last year. This morning, they showed up unannounced at my apartment, faces pale after hearing what I had done. My mother perched on my second hand sofa like she was afraid to leave an impression. My father remained standing, the vintage Rolex absent from his wrist. The trust fund, he said flatly, your grandfather's trust fund. You found a way to access it. Poured myself water, taking a slow sip. I didn't find a way. I always had a way. Grandpa made sure of that. Grandpa Elliott knew exactly what kind of people my parents were long before I did. While they showcased Brian's barely passing grades with expensive gifts, Grandpa quietly attended my science fairs. When I won the state mathematics championship, my parents were at Brian's baseball tournament. Grandpa was the only one who stood and applauded. He'd been the only one at my medical school acceptance dinner who seemed genuinely proud when he died during my second Year, they called it sudden. At the will reading, my parents sat smug, already planning how they would spend their inheritance. What they didn't expect was the trust fund, seven figures grown from decades of investment named solely to me. My mother had been livid. Brian has plans, too, she'd insisted. We'll contest it. Elliot was of sound mind, the attorney replied. He updated this trust three months ago with specific instructions. What nobody knew was that Grandpa had created a second trust, controlling 51% of the family business my father supposedly owned. Silent majority ownership activated only if two conditions were met. I completed medical school and my father turned his back on his children for money. The disownment papers signed weeks before Christmas qualified perfectly. Over the next year, I discovered everything. My father.

So I started acting extremely cold with her. She completely lost it. We've been married 12 years when she sat me down after our third therapy session and said the words that killed me. I only see you as my best friend now. I'm not attracted to you anymore. For three years, she'd been refusing intimacy. I thought it was stress from raising our two kids. Turns out she just been tolerating me this whole time. She even said she built up resentment toward me because I spent too much time with the kids instead of her. The therapist kept asking her why, what changed? When did the attraction die? Every answer was, I don't know. She couldn't give me a single reason. Then one night everything got worse. Came home drunk around midnight and basically crawled into bed begging me. I said no at first, but she kept pushing and crying until I gave in. Biggest mistake of my life. Next morning she woke up and wouldn't even look at me. I feel disgusted with myself, she said. Her voice cold. I have a rule about never sleeping with friends. That's what you are to me now, a friend. I felt like I'd been punched in the stomach. I asked her what I could possibly do to fix this. What was so unattractive about me? Her answer, I don't know. You're just not what I Want anymore but you're a great co parent and provider. She wanted to keep our roommate dynamic as she called it. Basically, I handle half the parenting, pay most of the bills and she gets to live her life without any of the marriage part. That's when something inside me just switched off. I told her, fine, we're roommates now. Starting immediately, I started implementing what they call the 180, complete eat emotional detachment. I stopped doing any of the little things I used to do for her. No more morning coffee made her way. No more helping with her work projects. No more picking up her dry cleaning. No more being her emotional support. She asked me to help her move some furniture in her home office. I said no. She looked absolutely shocked. Are you serious right now? Why are you being so petulant? You're in charge of your own life now. I said calmly, just like.

Then I found her on the floor. I was upstairs playing video games when I heard my mom yell from the kitchen, Pizza's here. I paused my game and ran downstairs because I was starving. But when I got to the kitchen, my mom was laying on the floor unconscious. Blood was coming from a gash on her forehead. Stand standing behind her was my dad holding a crowbar. Dad, I hadn't seen him in three years, not since the divorce when mom got full custody and a restraining order. He looked different now, skinnier and his eyes were bloodshot like he hadn't slept in days. Sit down and listen to my instructions, he said. I sat at the kitchen table with my hands shaking. My phone was upstairs. Mom wasn't moving, but I could see her chest rising and falling. So she was still breathing. What do you know about your older sister? Dad asked. Mom told me that when Meadow went to college, she got with the wrong people and cut off the family. Dad laughed, but it wasn't a happy sound. Jesus, that's the lie she told you. What else she Said? Meadow stole all the money from my college fund before she left. That's why we had to move to this smaller house. What if I told you your sister's actually in a coma right now? What? Dad sat across from me but kept a crowbar in his hand. Meadow got Pregnant in college when she came home to tell us your mother beat her so bad she was hardly breathing. That's not true. Mom would never do that. Your mother moved Meadow to Iowa to work on her parents farm. Hold, everyone. Meadow ran away. But she's been keeping her there for two years, beating her every time she tried to leave or contact anyone. You're lying. I've been searching for Meadow for three years thinking she was missing. Your mother told me the same story about drugs and bad people. But last week her father called me. He couldn't watch it anymore. Told me everything. I looked at my mom on the floor. She was so small and normal looking. She made me sandwiches and helped with homework. She couldn't be capable of what dad was saying. Meadow's been in a coma for three weeks. Your mom pushed her down the stairs at the farm. Told the hospital Meadow was mentally ill and fell. Dad.

She admitted Tyler had been checking in on her every day since the sickness incident, sending her articles about toxic relationships. He'd even made her write down a list of my controlling behaviors. This dupe I made her controlling, the birthday gift I'd saved up for manipulation. She fell for all of it. I'm so sorry, she sobbed. I want you back. I'll do anything. My blood boiled. While I'd been destroying myself with guilt, Tyler had been executing a calculated takedown, and she'd been his willing puppet. Then she said the part that made me see red. I'll keep our relationship secret from Tyler this time. He won't be a problem. She still didn't get it. I told her I'd take her back on one condition. We had to text Tyler right now, tell him off for controlling her life, and tell him she was getting back with me anyway. She argued. She called it extreme, but eventually she did it. Sent me the screenshot. The second I saw it, I hung up and blocked her. Two days later, Tyler called from a random number, started screaming at me, calling me a liar, saying Macy was too good for me. Then he called me a bitch. I snapped. You're nothing but a backup boyfriend who will spend his whole Life driving other guys away. And guess what? When it mattered, Macy chose me over you. He burst into tears, hung up. Last week, my friend threw a party. Macy showed up with Tyler, both ready for a fight. She walked up while I was talking to another girl and accused me of cheating, calling me a phony in front of everyone. Tyler stood behind her, smirking. Actually, I said you should consider yourself lucky I gave you a chance at all. You're a spineless puppet. And Tyler's so insecure, he had to use a burner phone just to talk to me. You two are perfect for each other. I hope you end up together, because no one else should have to deal with people like you. Tyler started screaming. Macy dragged him out. The party erupted in cheers. Update three months later, I just found out Tyler and Macy are officially dating. Guess I was right about them being perfect for each other. I'm engaged now. To someone who doesn't have a psycho best friend controlling her life. We're getting married next summer.

I worked at the same insurance office for almost 10 years. Every single morning I'd stop at Jerry's Coffee on Fifth Street, order my usual black coffee and add what I thought was cream from the self serve station. My co workers always made fun of how strong and bitter my coffee was. They take one sip and make faces like I was drinking motor oil. How do you drink that garbage? My best mate Ashley would say watching me gulp down my morning cup. I just laugh and tell her I liked my coffee with character, strong and bold, just like me. The whole office knew about my weird coffee preference. Even during meetings, people would joke about how I could probably strip paint with whatever I was drinking. For almost a decade, this was my routine. Same coffee shop, same order, same weird looks from everyone who tried it. I thought I just had different taste buds or something. Maybe I was just tougher than everyone else when it came to bitter drinks. And one Tuesday morning, Jerry's Coffee was closed for kitchen repairs. A handwritten sign on the door said they'd be back in a week. I panicked a little because I'm not great with change. But I spotted another coffee place just two blocks down called bean. There I walked in and ordered my usual black coffee. Please, the young Barista with purple hair smiled and handed me the cup. Then I asked for cream on the side, just like I always did at Jerry's. She pointed to a small metal pitcher next to the sugar packets. I poured in my usual amount and took that first sip. My mouth almost dropped open. The coffee was smooth, creamy, actually enjoyable to drink. Instead of feeling like punishment, I thought maybe this place just had really good coffee beans or something. When Jerry's reopened the next week, I went back to my normal routine. But something was bugging me. Now, why did that other place taste so different? Was their coffee really that much better? I decided to pay closer attention to what I was doing. I walked up to the self serve.

But something about her cries seemed desperate, different, not like a tantrum. I'm a kindergarten teacher. After 15 years, you develop a sense for these things. The woman kept whispering. It's okay, sweetie, almost there. But she wasn't doing any of the natural things a parent does. No rubbing the back, no gentle bouncing, no terms of endearment that felt personal. I followed at a distance, pretending to shop. The girl's cries started changing, becoming more panicked. I want my mommy, she whispered. You said Mommy was here. The woman shifted uncomfortably. We are, honey. Just a few more things. Her eyes darted to the exits. When they reached the dairy section, I saw another woman with a cart full of groceries. She was younger, probably early 30s, talking frantically on her phone. I don't know, John. She was right here. I just turned around for a second to grab her juice. He knows not to wander off. No. She was wearing her favourite butterfly clip. The purple and silver one. Yes. And her yellow polka dot dress. My stomach dropped. The crying girl was wearing exactly that, a yellow polka dot dress and a butterfly hair clip, purple and silver, just like the one the younger woman was now Clutching in her free hand, I stepped closer to them, acting like I was reaching for milk. The girls next words confirmed everything Mommy had.

Natalie claimed she was allergic to shellfish, nuts, Oy, eggs, gluten and dairy. Dinners took forever while she interrogated servers. Is the chicken broth made in house? What oil do you use? My friends stopped inviting us out. My mom stopped hosting holidays because Natalie needed special meals in separate pans. My birthday, we went to an Italian restaurant.

I pulled out pad Thai, peanut sauce crusted on the edges, the same sauce she made a waiter cry over. The receipt was state pulled to the bag. Recent. Did you find it? She yelled. Yeah, I said, and shoved everything back. My heart was pounding. I couldn't sleep after what I saw. I told her I had to work late. Parked outside her place and waited. She walked out and got in her car. I followed. She drove to a seafood restaurant, the same one she refused to visit with me. The shellfish in the air could kill me. Do you want me to die? She had said. I felt horrible suggesting it. Now I watched her walk inside like it was nothing. I waited, then followed. I sat at the bar where she couldn't see me.

What are the chances this means we can stay together? Yay! You're right, babe. We have to stay together now. I just wanted to break up with my girlfriend of 5 years so I could have an 11 person orgy. Is that. That's so much to ask for? Baby, I've always wanted to do that. Oh my god, babe, I had no idea. Let me just check the internet and. Oh damn it! Orgy's got banned now too?

So I canceled the Wi-Fi, turned off the heat, and scheduled the cable guy for the day. She's moving. Last Tuesday, my roommate Kayla drops this bomb while I'm making dinner. Hey, so I'm moving in with Blake next month. But don't worry. I'll still pay rent until our lease ends in March. I thought that was actually pretty responsible of her. We'd been roommates for two years, never had major drama. I figured we'd coast through the final months. I'm a freak. Boy, was I wrong. The very next night, Blake shows up with a duffel bag. Then he never left. Suddenly, my quiet apartment turned into their little love nest. Blake's using my Netflix account, rating my leftovers, leaving his sweaty gym clothes on my couch. His gaming setup appeared in the living room. His toothbrush showed up next to mine. Dude basically moved in without paying a single dollar. When I brought it up to Kayla, she just shrugged. What's the big deal? I'm still paying my half of rent. He's just staying over. Stay over for three weeks straight? Apparently. That's when it hit me. She wanted to double dip, keep paying for a backup apartment while test driving domestic life with lake. If things went south, she'd have somewhere to return to. Meanwhile, I'm subsidizing her relationship experiment. So I decided to optimize our living situation for the reality. She'd created. First, I called our internet company. Hi, I need to downgrade my plan. Immediately went from our 500 megabits per second speed to the basic 25 milla bps package. Perfect for one person checking emails. Absolute hell for three people streaming gaming and video calling simultaneously. Next, I adjusted the thermostat to 62 degrees and installed a little lock box over it. My apartment, my comfort level. If they wanted it warmer, they could wear sweaters or contribute to heating bills. Then I scheduled every service appointment I've been putting off for months. Able technician at 8:00am on moving day to upgrade our service. HVAC maintenance guy at 10:00am for the annual inspection. Pest control at noon for our quarterly treatment. Internet installation guy at two PM to set up my new solo plan. Building Maintenance at four PM to fix the bathroom faucet. Carpet cleaning at six PM because why not make it a full day? The chaos started within days. Blake's big gaming tournament kept lagging out because.

Now he regrets everything. When Jake knocked me up at 17, he laughed, actually laughed, said my parents will kill me if this ruins my baseball scholarship. Within a week, his entire family moved three states away, ghosted me, blocked me, vanished like a coward in a Letterman jacket. But I wasn't going to be a statistic. My parents were furious but weirdly supportive. They helped me finish high school online and I gave birth to my son Tommy over Christmas break with jingle bells playing in the background. Cute, right? Tommy and I basically grew up together. I worked three jobs while getting my nursing degree. Mom watched him when she could. We ate so much ramen that he thought it was a food group. We lived in a tiny shoebox apartment with a couch I bought off Craigslist for $15 and dreams duct taped together. But it worked. By the time Tommy was 10, I was a pediatric ICU nurse and he was this funny, smart, ridiculous little human who made life fun even on two hours of sleep. Then I met Daniel. Daniel's a pediatric surgeon, smart, kind, didn't blink when I told him I had a 10 year old. On our third date, Tommy had a cold and Daniel brought over soup and comic books. I think I fell in love right then. Two years later, we got married and Daniel adopted Tommy. Tommy calls him dad like he Was born to because honestly, he kind of was. We had twin girls three years ago and Tommy is the sweetest big brother. Straight a student, star pitcher for his high school and I mean star college scouts come to see him. Then last month, his team made it to the state championships. I was screaming my lungs out from the bleachers, phone in hand, filming every pitch like a full blown stage, mom. That's when I saw Jake. Same face, just older. He was staring at Tommy like he was.

But he just sat there staring at me, waiting for my reaction. The room went silent. My sister Lily froze her fork halfway to her mouth. She looked at me with wide eyes, like she couldn't believe what she just heard. I swallowed the piece of ham I was chewing and put my fork down. What? You heard me. He said. You're no longer welcome here. You need to move out. I just sat there trying to process. I'm 23, have a steady job. Could have moved out years ago, but I stayed because they needed me. I paid the electric Bill, the internet, groceries most weeks. Things they couldn't afford. Because my dad had been unemployed for years and my mom only worked part time. I wasn't a burden. I was the reason the lights were still on in that house. And now, out of nowhere, I was being kicked out like some useless freeloader. Mom finally spoke up. Maybe we should talk about this later. But dad interrupted. No, Ed. This is my house. I make the rules. And I say he's done here. Lily put down her fork. She was only 16, and I could tell she was scared. She stared at Our parents. Like, she didn't even recognize them. If they could throw me out so easily, what did that mean for her? I took a deep breath. I wasn't going to argue or beg. If they wanted me out, fine. But they weren't ready for what that really meant. I leaned back in my chair. Alright, I said. My dad sat up straighter, like he'd won some imaginary battle. My mom still looked uncomfortable, but she didn't say anything. Maybe she was in.

Then she slammed the door in our faces. I stopped trying after that. Last month, my dad called and said, Lily died. I couldn't breathe. He said it was a complication from her condition. She got pneumonia and her body couldn't fight it. I was sobbing and he was crying, too. He said, the funeral is Saturday. I said, can I come? He was quiet for a long time and then said, your mother says no. I hung up and screamed into a pillow for an hour. My little sister was dead, and I wasn't allowed to say goodbye. I drove to the funeral anyway. I sat in my car across the street and watched them carry her casket out. My mom was hysterical and my dad was holding her up. I wanted to run over there and hold my mom and cry together, but I knew she pushed me away. I went to the cemetery after everyone left and stood at Lily's grave. I told her I was sorry. Sorry I couldn't protect her. Sorry I wasn't allowed to be her sister for the last 20 years. Sorry she died thinking I didn't love her. Two weeks later, my dad called again. He said, your mother wants to see you. I said, why now? He said, she needs you. We both do. Lily was everything to us. And now she's gone and we don't have anyone. I felt something snap inside me. I said, you had me. You Always had me. I tried for 20 years, and you shut me out. He said, please, where are your parents? We need our daughter. I drove to their house. My mom looked like she'd aged 10 years in two weeks. She reached for me and said, I'm so sorry. I was wrong about everything. I blamed you, and I shouldn't have. Please come back. Be our daughter again. We can't lose you, too. I stood there looking at this woman who'd spent 20 years telling me I destroyed her life. I said, you kept me from my sister for 20 years. I'll never get that back. She died thinking I abandoned her. Do you understand that? My mom was sobbing and said, I know. I'm sorry. Please. I said, I had a daughter five years ago. Your granddaughter. You slammed the door in her face on Christmas. My dad said, we wanna meet her. We wanna be a family again. I said, you don't get to decide that now. You had 20 years to be my family. You spent all of it punishing me for something that wasn't my fault. And now Lily's gone and you're alone, and suddenly I'm good enough? My mom said, please don't leave us. I said, you left me first. Then I walked out.

What did your daughter's boyfriend do that forever changed how you saw him as a cop? I hated the idea of my 17 year old daughter dating anyone. But when she brought home this boy named Pete, I lost it. He had a motorcycle, tattoos, and that smug smile that made me want to run his name through the system. I made it my mission to break them up. I'd randomly show up at places they hung out, flash my badge around, and remind Pete that I knew how to make bodies disappear. But this kid never flinched. He just smile and say, have a good day, sir. When he came for dinner the first time, I placed my gun on the table next to my plate. My wife kicked me under the table, but I didn't care. Pete just looked at it and said, nice Glock 19, sir. My uncle's got the same one at his security firm. That's when the real torture began. I started making him come over every weekend to bond. I'd have him help me with the most back breaking chores I could think of. Rashingling the roof in July. Digging out a tree stump by hand. Moving every piece of furniture in the house to steam clean the carpets. This kid never complained. He'd show up at 7 a m. Sharp, already wearing work clothes. Even brought his own work gloves. When I'd try to wear him down with endless tasks, he just Say what's next, sir? One Saturday, I had him helping me rebuild the deck. I was being extra harsh, making him redo boards that were perfectly fine. Around noon, my daughter brought us water. As she walked away, I caught Pete watching her. But it wasn't the way most teenage boys looked at girls. He had this soft smile, like he was watching something precious. I decided to test him. You know she's way out of your league, right? He wiped his forehead and said, oh, I know, sir. Trust me. I know. That's why I'm here every weekend, letting you test me. Because she's worth it. I was about to respond when we heard screaming from inside the house. We both ran in to find my wife on the kitchen floor. She'd slipped on some water and couldn't move her leg. Before I could even process what was happening, Pete had already called 9 1 1. He rattled off our address, my wife's symptoms, and even mentioned her previous back surgery. Then he grabbed our first aid kit and started checking her vitals, talking to her calmly the whole time. When I asked how he knew what to do, he shrugged and said, been taking EMT classes at night.

Day 55, Sophie and I went hiking. No photos, no GPS, just a paper map adventure. We got lost for three hours. It was the best date I ever had. Day 60, Emma started cracking. She called me at midnight. How are you doing this? I am going insane and I still have my phone. I told her the truth. I stopped missing it after week 3. Day 65, the family had a barbecue.

I forfeit. Day 85, Brad dropped out, too, said his wife threatened divorce because he was on his phone during family dinner every night. Day 89, just me left. The lawyer called. You won?

Because Uncle Michael was not testing who could live without a phone. He was testing who was willing to change. And I already got what I needed. Emma handed me her Audi keys. Anyway, you earned this. I sold the car, paid off my student loans, took Sophie to that restaurant where I had the panic attack on day 8. We laughed about it, ordered without looking anything up. She moved in with me.

I had to sit on them to stop checking. Day five, I woke up in a cold sweat because I dreamed I accidentally opened Twitter. Day eight, I had a full panic attack at a restaurant because I could not not look up the menu online. The waiter had to talk me through the options like I was a child.

So I invited the victim over for dinner without telling my daughter. My 14 year old Sophie had always been popular, Ree Council, SIBO team, the friend everyone wanted. So when I got an email from school about concerning behavior, I assumed it was a mistake. Then I saw the front, kill yourself. Nobody likes you anyway. Even your mom probably wishes you were dead. Do everyone a favor and disappear. A fashion after message to a girl named Rachel sent from Sophie's Instagram account. My hand shook as I scrolled. This wasn't my daughter. The Sophie I knew volunteered at animal shelters and helped younger kids with homework. But the Tibetan Sams didn't lie. During family movie night, during her study group, even during church, I didn't confront her immediately. Instead, I did something that still makes my husband think I'm insane. I found Rachel's mother on Facebook and invited them to dinner that Friday, telling her I wanted to connect with families in Sophie's grade. Just some people from school, I said. Watching her nod absently while texting on her phone. Friday arrived. When the doorbell rang, I asked Sophie to get it. I'll never forget the color draining from her face when she saw Rachel standing there with her mother. The silence stretched until Rachel's mom cheerfully said, isn't that nice? Dinner was excruciating. Sophie barely spoke while Rachel picked at her food. Eyes down, I Kept the conversation flowing, asking Rachel about her interest, her classes, her artwork. With each question, Sophie seemed to shrink further into her chair. Rachel's quite the artist, her mother said, though someone at school keeps ripping down her drawings from her locker.

I discovered my wife was cheating when the kids mentioned Uncle Steve. Have been helping mommy feel better at night. The betrayal hurt worse than anything I'd ever felt, but I knew staying would destroy me, so I filed for divorce. During the proceedings, I practically begged her to be reasonable about custody. She looked me in the eyes and said, I would never keep your children from you for six months. She actually kept her word, and we fell into this decent routine where we'd exchange the kids every Friday without any drama. She'd even text me little updates about their school days, and we managed to sit together at their soccer games like normal divorced parents. But then I pulled up for my regular Friday pickup, and there was a for sale sign in the yard, and the house was completely empty. I actually fell to my knees on their lawn because I knew she'd done it. She'd actually taken my kids. I called her phone over and over, but it just rang. When I gave up, I noticed the notification for a voicemail that came at 6:00am. Her voice was casual, saying, we've relocated to Seattle for Steve's job, and the kids are already enrolled in school. Like she was telling me about changing their soccer practice time. I sat in that driveway for an hour, dissociating, because she'd been planning on moving 3,000 miles. Away for months while looking me in the eye every Friday. The next morning, a process server handed me court papers claiming I was an absent father who prioritized work over my children. And I realized she'd also been documenting my business trips, kept calling and texting, begging to just hear my kids voices. It actually took three days for me to get through to her. She answered, and instead of explaining anything, she offered monthly video calls like she was being generous.

What did your daughter's boyfriend do that forever changed how you saw him as a cop? I hated the idea of my 17 year old daughter dating anyone. But when she brought home this boy named Pete, I lost it. He had a motorcycle, tattoos and that smug smile that made me wanna run his name through the system. I made it my mission to break them up. I'd randomly show up at places they hung out, flash my badge around and remind Pete that I knew how to make bodies disappear. But this kid never flinched. He just smile and say, have a good day, sir. When he came for dinner the first time, I placed my gun on the table next to my plate. My wife kicked me under the table but I didn't care. Pete just looked at it and said, Nice Glock 19, sir. My uncle's got the same one at his security firm. That's when the real torture began. I started making him come over every weekend to bond. I'd have him help me with the most backbreaking chores I could think of. Reshingling the roof in July, digging out a tree stump by hand, moving every piece of furniture in the house to steam clean the carpets. This kid never complained. He'd show up at 7:00am sharp already wearing work clothes, even brought his own work gloves. When I try to wear him down with endless tasks, he just say, what's next, sir? One Saturday, I had him helping me rebuild the deck. I was being extra harsh, making him redo boards that were perfectly fine. Around noon, my daughter brought us water. As she walked away, I caught Pete watching her. But it wasn't the way most teenage boys looked at girls. He had this soft smile like he was watching something precious. I decided to test him. You know she's way out of your league, right? He wiped his forehead and said, oh, I know, sir. Trust me. I know. That's why I'm here every weekend, letting you test me cause she's worth it. I was about to respond when we heard screaming from inside the house. We both ran in to find my wife on the kitchen floor. She'd.

My sister Emma had been planning her wedding for two years, and I was supposed to be her maid of honor. She kept dropping hints about how all the bridesmaids needed to look cohesive in the photos and how important it was for everyone to put their best foot forward for her big day. Look, I'm not stupid. I knew what she was getting at. I'd gained about 40 pounds over the past few years since I started working from home. Emma never said it directly, but every time we talked about the wedding, she'd mention some diet she saw on Instagram or ask if I was getting ready for the wedding season. The breaking point came three months before the wedding, when we went dress shopping. I tried on the bridesmaid dress in my size, and Emma just stared at me in the mirror with this tight smile. She asked if maybe we should size up for comfort, and then suggested I might want to start doing some pre wedding prep with her. That weekend, she texted me a link to some fitness app and said, thought this might help with your confidence for the big day. I screenshot that text and sent it to my boyfriend Tyler, who said she was being a total bitch, but I decided I'd show her. I downloaded my Fitness Pal that night and started tracking everything. I cut out all the late night snacking, stopped getting Coffee with extra syrup and started walking to the grocery store instead of driving. I wasn't trying to do anything extreme. I just wanted to lose enough weight that Emma couldn't make her little comments anymore. The first month, I lost 12 pounds. Emma noticed right away when we met for brunch and kept asking what I was doing differently. I told her I was just eating better, and she got this weird look on her face like she didn't expect me to actually do anything about it. By month two, I was down 25 pounds and feeling amazing. I bought new jeans that actually fit.

My roommate, Keisha, was getting ready to head out to her salon and saw me struggling with my messy curls in the bathroom mirror. She just laughed and said, girl, come with me.

Walking into that salon was like entering a whole different world. The energy was incredible. Everyone was talking, laughing, music playing, kids running around while their moms got their hair done. It felt alive in a way that the buy it sterile salons I was used to never did. The stylist, Miss Janet, took one look at my hair and shook her head, baby, who's been cutting your hair? Because they need to stop. She started running her fingers through it, asking me about my routine, what products I used, how I dried it. Nobody had ever asked me those questions before. They just wet it, cut it and send me on my way. Miss Janet spent two hours on My hair, two hours. She deep conditioned it, trimmed each curl individually, showed me how to scrunch it properly and sent me home with specific instructions about what products to use and how often to wash it. My hair looked better than it ever had in my entire life. But here's the thing that really got me. She charged me $40. 40. The salon back home charged.

They didn't realize they just declared war on 2,000 bored teenagers with nothing but time and fight. It started when Principal Morrison announce the new policy. Students caught sharing the school Wi-Fi password will face immediate suspension. The password was 47 characters long, randomly generated every week and only given to teachers. My friend Marcus was the first to strike back. He brought a 30 foot Ethernet cable to school and plugged directly into the computer lab wall. When Mr Morrison walked by, Marcus was sitting in the hallway, laptop connected, cable snaking under the door. Marcus, what are you doing using wired internet? Sir? The policy only mentions Wi-Fi. That cable is a tripping hazard. I put up caution sign. Marcus had indeed placed tiny yellow wet floor signs every three feet along the cable. Mr Morrison updated the policy. No Ethernet cables over six feet. So Marcus brought six separate six foot cables and five friends. They formed a human chain, each person holding a laptop connected to each other, passing internet from the lab to the cafeteria like a digital bucket brigade. This is ridiculous, Mr Morrison said. This is compliance. Marcus replied, each cable is exactly six feet. New rule, no daisy chaining connection. That's when Jennifer got involved. She noticed the smart TV in the library was connected to Wi-Fi. She screen mirrored her phone to the TV. use The TV's browser to create a hotspot that broadcast to her laptop. Jennifer, you're using the school Wi-Fi? No, sir, I'm using the TV's connection. The TV isn't a student. The he doesn't need suspension threats, she added sweetly. Mr Morrison banned using school devices as intermediary. Alex took a different approach. He stood outside the teacher's lounge with a clipboard claiming he was conducting a password security audit for his computer science project. He'd ask teachers to write their password down to test memorability. Pattern 3 teachers actually did it before words read. Alex, this is deception. This is social engineering research, sir. Very educational. Did you get the password? That would be unethical to reveal. Meanwhile, Sarah had noticed something beautiful. The attendant system auto connected to Wi-Fi when teachers logged in. She volunteered as an office aide and memorized the password as it briefly appeared on screen during setup. She didn't share it though.

My real name was Anakin Skywalker Smith. Not a nickname. Not my middle names. That was my actual legal first and middle name printed on my birth certificate. My parents met at a Star Wars convention in 1997, got engaged at another convention, had a Star Wars themed wedding, and when I was born in 2,002, they thought naming me after the main character would be the ultimate tribute to their favourite franchise. They love Star Wars so much they had a room in our house dedicated to collectibles. Spent thousands on replica lightsabers. Went to every movie premiere in full costume. When I was little, it didn't matter because kids didn't get the reference yet. Elementary school was manageable because most kids hadn't seen the movies. Teachers would smile awkwardly when they read my name, but nobody made it a big deal. Then fourth grade happened and the revenge of the Sith came out. Suddenly, every kid in school knew exactly who Anakin Skywalker was and what he became. A kid named Marcus stood up in the cafeteria and yelled, there's Darth Vader! And the entire lunchroom lost it. Within days, kids started making breathing sounds when I walked by, doing force show gestures, calling me the chosen one in this mocking tone. Someone put a Darth Vader mask in my locker. The jokes never stopped. Middle school destroyed me. Every single teacher who called roll Would pause at my name. Some would even laugh, thinking it was funny, like my parents did something clever. Kids who didn't know me would hear my name and immediately start quoting the movies. I ate lunch in the library because the cafeteria was constant harassment. Someone started a petition as a joke to get me to change my last name to Vader. It got a 150 signatures before a teacher confiscated it. I begged my parents to let me go by my middle name, Skywalker, but my dad said that's even worse. And my mom insisted I should be proud of such a unique, powerful name. They genuinely thought they'd given me this amazing gift. By eighth grade, I stopped introducing myself entirely. I just say, call me whatever you want, because I knew the second I said my real name, people would either laugh or immediately start making Star Wars references. I started skipping class.

My heart is pounding so loud I can barely hear her. I dig deeper, pulling county records at 2 in the morning because sleep is impossible now. I find his will. Four months ago, dad changed it to split everything equally among all three kids, including me. Before that, it left everything to mom and the golden children. I'm going to be sick. I run to the bathroom and dry heave over the toilet because the math is mathing and I don't like where it's going. I find Dad's neighbor on Facebook, message her and she responds within minutes like she's been waiting for someone to ask. She tells me that dad was asking for me constantly those last few weeks. He was confused and asking why I wouldn't visit. Mom told everyone I refused to see him, that I was too busy with my little nursing career. I call in a favor with a friend at the hospital and get Dad's final blood work. When I walk through the funeral home doors, Mom's grief mask shatters into panic. She's mid eulogy, sobbing about being by his side until the end. I walk over. My father didn't die of a heart attack. He died because you took him off his medications and drugged him instead. The church goes silent. Four months ago, dad changed his will to split everything three ways. Two weeks later, you started feeding him smoothies. Laced with crushed sedatives mixed with dementia medication. I have the blood work right here showing overdose levels. Uncle Frank grabs the papers, his face collapsing as he reads. You can't prove anything, my brother shouts. My sister breaks down sobbing. It isn't like that. He was in pain. I told them it was wrong. Shut up. Mom lunges at her. The police investigated and the autopsy confirmed that dad had extreme liver failure and must have been in incredible pain. But what my family gave him wasn't to help. It was a fatal drug interaction consistent with prolonged medical neglect and deliberate overdose. Mom was arrested and my brother and sister might be charged as accessories. The will was honoured and right now I'm the only one able to spend any of the money.

Mom said casually. Mia needed that money for the DJ. Besides Theo's 7, he won't remember this. Mia's 25th is a real milestone. Something in me snapped. I pulled out my phone and called Diego, the event coordinator. Diego, it's Sebastian. I need you here now. With security, 40 unauthorized guests invoking the venue violation clause. 10 minutes away, Mia's face went from confident to panic. What are you doing getting my son's party back? 12 minutes later, Diego walked in with two security guards and the venue manager. The music cut off. Complete silence. The manager's voice over the PA. This is a private event for a child's birthday. Anyone not on the original guest list exits immediately or we contact the police. Mia grabbed the microphone. You can't do this. This is my party. Diego calmly took it back. Miss leave now or we will call authorities. Chaos erupted. Mia's friends yelling, dad arguing with Diego, mom blocking the door. Within 15 minutes, everyone was out. Mia stood in the parking lot, mascara running scream, meaning you humiliated me in front of everyone. I'll never forgive you. Dad pointed at me. You're selfish. Mia deserve this. I looked at all three. You hurt my son, your grandson on his birthday. Zero guilt. Mom scoff. He's fine. Kids are resilient. I opened my banking app and canceled the automatic transfer. The one paying me has one 400 dollar monthly rent. What are you doing, Mia shrieked. I've paid your rent for 36 months. That's 50. Four hundred dollars ends today. I looked at my parents. If she deserves everything you pay for it, don't contact me. We're done. I blocked all three numbers right there. Then I called every parent from Theo's class. Wakes up earlier, party's back on. Can your child still come? 19 said yes and turned around. Diego felt terrible and personally paid Spider Man double to return. The bakery still had Theo's original cake. By five PM, the hall filled with the right sounds, kids laughing, splashing, screaming on playground equipment. Theo's face when Spider Man walked back in made every dollar worth it. That night, Theo hugged me before bed. Best birthday ever, dad, my phone's been silent for three weeks. No apologies, no reconciliation attempts. It's the best silence I've ever heard.

I'm Victor, 26, and this literally happened last weekend. Growing up in Vegas, I was obsessed with my neighbor Emily. Asked her out twice. Once at 15, again at 18. Both times she said no. Wanted to live her life in college. Victor, you're sweet, but I need to experience the world first, she said, heading off to UCLA while I went to a local school. Maybe when we're older. Crushed, I focused on myself. Started working out, got my degree in engineering. Then sophomore year, I ran into her younger sister, Haley, at university. She was studying the same major. Struggling with calculus. Need help? I offered. She blushed, something I'd never noticed when we were kids. And I only had eyes for Emily. We clicked in instantly. Same interests, same humor, same values. Everything Emily and I never had. Haley was thoughtful where Emily was impulsive. She listened when I talked instead of scrolling her phone. She actually wanted to build something real. We've been secretly dating for four years now. Kept it quiet because, honestly, our families would lose their minds. They've been shipping me and Emily since we were 12. Last Thursday, I drove to my parents house with the engagement ring. My grandmother's vintage sapphire that mom had been saving for the right girl. I was playing, planning to propose Saturday, when Haley arrived for the weekend family barbecue. But when I walked in, Emily was there. Apparently she'd graduated, moved back home, and had been asking about me constantly. Heard you got hot. She laughed, looking me up and down. And successful software engineer, right? I spent the day catching up, hearing about her college adventures. She partied hard, dated a string of guys, traveled Europe last summer. The whole time she kept touching my arm, standing too close. You know what's funny? She said that evening, as we sat on the porch, I kept thinking about you. Wondering what would have happened if I'd said yes back then. My stomach dropped. Emily. I was young and stupid. But Victor. But I'm ready now. Ready to be serious. She moved closer. I know you still love me. You always have. I stared at her, speechless. This was everything eighteen year old me had dreamed of hearing. But now. Now it felt wrong. Empty. I don't know what to say. I managed. Say yes. Say you'll give us a real chance. Before I could respond, my mom announced dinner. Both families gathered around the table. My parents, my sister Emily's.

Day one without cigarettes, and I discovered my body had been keeping a hit list. 23 years of smoking. That's 8,395 days, 335,800 cigarettes. At seven minutes per cigarette, I'd literally spent 4.5 years of my life with death between my lips. The breaking point wasn't poetic. My six year old son, Lucas had drawn our family for school. Mom was a flower, sister was a butterfly. Dad was a skeleton holding fire sticks. Why am I dead? I asked. You're not dead yet. He said, matter of factly. But missus Johnson says cigarettes make people into skeletons. So I drew your future. I quit that second. No ceremony. Just dropped my pack in his crayon box and walked away.

The teller asked if I needed medical attention. Hour 8. The headache felt like someone was injecting molten lead behind my eyes. I vomited twice in the office bathroom. My boss found me on the floor. Food poisoning. I lied through chattering teeth. That night, I didn't sleep. I counted every single second. 28,800 of them.

Oh, she's exaggerating. That's not what happened. Nobody wants to hear about that. After dinner, Nathan asked if we could talk outside. My stomach dropped. This was it. The lecture about how I was making things awkward, how I needed to be more supportive of my sister's happiness. We stood on the back porch, string lights casting shadows across the yard. He was quiet for a long moment. I ask you something. His voice was careful. Does she always treat you like that? I didn't know how to answer. My throat felt tight. He continued. Because I've watched her tonight. The way she talks over you, dismisses everything you say, makes these little comments that sound like jokes but aren't. He paused. And you just take it. Why? She's my sister. That's just how we are. That's not normal. His jaw was tight. I've been around your family for months now, and I'm just now realizing. She does this constantly, doesn't she? And everyone just lets it happen. I shrugged, trying to seem unbothered. It's fine. I'm used to it. That's the problem. He ran his hand through his hair. You shouldn't have to be used to it. Then he said the words that changed everything. I proposed to her thinking she was kind, generous. The person she is when we're alone. His voice cracked slightly. But after tonight, after really watching how she treats you, I realized something. The person I thought I was marrying doesn't exist. She's performing. And when the performance drops, this is who she really is. He looked directly at me. You're exactly who I wish she was. Patient, genuine. Someone who doesn't need to tear others down to feel important. My heart was pounding. Nathan, don't. I'm not saying this to make things weird. I'm saying it because I can't marry her. Not after seeing this. He pulled the engagement ring off his finger. I'm ending it tonight. She'll blame me. She'll blame everyone but herself. But that's not your problem anymore. He walked back inside minutes later, shouting, bar, doors! Gravel! My sister called 37 times. I didn't answer. Three days later, she showed up at 2:00am, makeup smeared, shaking. You seduced him. You ruined my life. I looked at her and felt nothing. Good night, Claire. I closed the door. Six months later, I ran into Nathan at a coffee shop. He smiled. Still taking it? I smiled back.

Growing up, she made sure I knew my place. You're the practice sister. The one guys date before they find someone like me. She'd say it at family dinners, at parties, anywhere with an audience. When I got my first boyfriend at 16, she told him I had commitment issues. Broke up with me two weeks later. When I got into community college, she announced at Thanksgiving that not everyone can handle real universities. Meanwhile, everyone hung on her. Every word about law school rankings and internship offers. The pattern never changed. Any achievement I had got minimized. Any relationship I started got poisoned. She'd befriend my boyfriends, plant seeds of doubt, and comfort me when things fell apart. You're just not relationship material, she'd say, rubbing my back. Some people are meant to be alone. By 25, I'd stopped trying, stopped dating, stopped sharing anything good that happened in my life because she'd find a way to ruin it. Then she met Nathan. Perfect Nathan, with his finance job, his tailored suits, parents, summer house in Cape Cod. She paraded him around like a trophy she'd won. Posted couple photos constantly with captions about finally finding someone who sees my worth. At Sunday dinner, she'd make him tell stories about expensive restaurants and weekend trips. She'd touch his arm possessively. Whenever I walked into The room. Like I might steal him just by existing. Six months in, they got engaged. The ring was massive. She made sure everyone saw it, holding her hand up to the light at every opportunity. The engagement party was at our parents house. She. It invited everyone. Nathan's colleagues, law school friends, distant relatives who barely knew us. That morning, she cornered me in the kitchen. I need you to tone it down tonight. Nathan's colleagues are here and I can't have you embarrassing me. She looked me up and down. Maybe wear something plain. Black is good on you. And try not to talk too much about your job. Nobody wants to hear about retail management. I wore black, stayed in the corner, smiled politely when people talked to me, gave one word answers. But Nathan kept glancing at me during dinner. Not in a creepy way, more like he was trying to figure something out. Like he was seeing something he hadn't noticed before. My sister noticed too. She got louder, more animated, touched his shoulder, constantly interrupted me every time I started.

I Told myself one level turned into 12. Suddenly it's 2:00am. I'm half asleep and I've looked at exactly zero pages of notes. I went to bed thinking, well, it's been a good run. Next morning, I drag myself to school running on four hours of sleep and vibe, literally just vibes. No breakfast, no confidence, no clue. I walk into that classroom and everyone's doing last minute cramming. Terrell's flipping through his flash cards like his life depends on it. Another kids rocking back and forth, mumbling formulas. One girl looked like she was about to cry. Test start. I open the booklet. First question, no idea. Second question, also no idea. I'm reading these questions like I've never seen the English language before. Math section, straight guessing. Science, picking answers that sounded right. Reading comprehension. I'm out here choosing based on what I would have done in that situation. If the character seemed chill, I picked C. If they seemed stressed, I went with B. That was my system. 30 minutes in, I'm done. Not because I finished carefully, because there's no point staring at questions I don't know. I turned it in and my teacher just looked at me disappointed, headshake that says I'm not even surprised. I went home fully prepared to tell my parents I'm staying in middle school another year, already planning my excuse, my apology speech, the whole thing. Two weeks later, grades drop online. I'm sitting there on my phone terrified to even Look, heart pounding, palm sweaty, I slowly scroll to my name, closed my eyes, opened them, saw 84%. And 84 I passed. Not only passed, but got a whole B. I just sat there.

Silently, my eight year old son was having nightmares about his math teacher. She makes me stay after class and says I'm stupid, he whispered one night. Tears streaming down his face. His little body trembled as he described how she'd make him erase and redo his work repeatedly while other kids went to recess. I was skeptical at first. Missus Whittaker had excellent reviews and a teaching award displayed prominently in her classroom. Parents fought to get their kids into her class. But when Jake's grades plummeted and he started faking stomachaches every morning, I knew something was wrong. The final straw was finding him hiding in his closet on a Monday morning clutching his math workbook and sobbing. Please don't make me go, mom, please. His voice was so small it broke my heart. My husband thought Jake was exaggerating. Kids don't like strict teachers, he said with a shrug. She's probably just pushing him to excel. At the parent teacher conference that week, Missus Whittaker was all smiles and professionalism in front of my husband. Jake just needs to apply himself more. He gets distracted easily. Her voice was honey sweet as she showed us his sloppy work. But I caught something my husband missed, the way Jake physically recoiled when she reached toward him, as if expecting a strike. On our way out, she placed her hand on Jake's shoulder and squeezed. We'll work harder next week, won't we? The Fear in his eyes confirmed everything. The principal dismissed my concerns without evidence. She's been here 20 years, Missus Collins. We've never had a complaint. He leaned back in his chair, barely hiding his annoyance. Children sometimes misinterpret constructive criticism as personal attacks. That night, I researched my options while Jake slept fitfully in our bed. Switching classes mid year wasn't allowed. Homeschooling would take weeks to arrange. The school board wouldn't act without proof and it would be my son's word against a respected teachers. So I bought a tiny voice recorder and carefully put it into the inner pocket of Jake's backpack. I showed him how to press the button under his desk each morning, making it seem like a secret game between. This is just to help me understand your day better, I explained, feeling slightly guilty about making him complicit. Our little secret. Okay. Three days later, I had what I needed. The recording captured Missus Whittaker's sweet voice while other teachers were present, but when alone with struggling student.

She waved back. They cut down the entire tree in about 5 hours. Took the stump and everything. My yard looked empty. I was sad. That tree was beautiful, but if Hannah wanted it gone, it was gone. What Hannah didn't realize was that tree wasn't just there looking pretty. It was blocking the afternoon sun. Our houses face west. During summer, the sun beats down on everything from 2 in the afternoon until sunset. My tree had been shading both our houses for years. Her house especially, her whole side yard and half her roof were covered by my tree's shadow. Not anymore. The first week after the tree came down, temperatures hit 95 degrees. I barely noticed, but Hannah noticed. About 10 days later, she knocks on my door. She looks tired, sweaty, different. She asks if we can talk. I let her in. She sits down and looks like she might cry. My electric Bill came yesterday, she says. It's true. Triple what it usually is, triple. I asked what happened. She said her AC has been running non stop since the tree came down. Her house gets so hot in the afternoon she can't even sit in her living room. The sun pours through her windows and heats everything up. She didn't realize how much the tree was helping until it was gone. I just sat there looking at her. She kept talking. Her garden is dying because there's no shade. Her Dog won't go outside in the afternoon because the yard is too hot. She's buying shade sales and awnings, but it's costing thousands. She stops and looks at me. Could you maybe plant another tree? She asks quietly. I'll pay for it. I'll pay for everything, please. I need that shade back. I told her I'd think about it. She nodded and left. That was six months ago. I did think about it. Then I decided not to plant and another tree. You know why? Because even if I planted one today, it would take years to grow big enough to provide shade. The tree I cut down took five years to get that big. She doesn't have five years. She stopped by last month and apologized. I told her there's nothing I can do now. She started crying and walked away. Sometimes I think about planting a new tree.

She came to me begging to plant it back because her electric Bill tripled. About five years ago, I planted a big oak tree in my front yard. It grew fast. Within a few years, it was huge and beautiful. It provided amazing shade for my house and kept my yard cool. In summer, the branches hung over slightly into my neighbor's yard, maybe three feet over the property line. My old neighbors never cared. They loved it because it gave them shade, too. We had a good relationship. Everything was fine. Then they moved and I met Hannah. Hannah bought the house last spring. She was nice at first. We did the whole welcome to the neighborhood thing. I even brought her cookies. Then summer hit and everything changed. One day, I'm pulling into my driveway, and Hannah storms over. She looks angry. Your tree is dropping leaves in my yard. She says I have to clean them up every single day. I apologized and said it's what trees do. She wasn't having it. The branches are hanging over my property line. That's illegal. You need to cut them back. I told her I'd trim them when I had time. She said I had two weeks or she'd call her lawyer. I thought she was kidding. She wasn't. Two weeks later, I get a letter from an actual lawyer. It Says I'm violating property laws, and if I don't trim the tree immediately, they'll sue me for damages and trespassing. Trespassing from a tree? I called a tree service and asked what it would cost to trim it. They said about $400. Then I asked what it would cost to remove the whole thing. They said 800. I thought about it for 10 seconds. Remove it, I said. The crew showed up three days later. Hannah came outside when she heard the chainsaws. She stood on her porch with this satisfied smile, like she'd won.

Dad called. Your mother's planning to come anyway, she says. You can't stop a mother from seeing her daughter's wedding. I knew she meant it. For 28 years, she made sure I knew my place. Rachel's punching bag, both literally and emotionally. But I wasn't seven anymore. The morning of my wedding. My hands trembled as I applied lipstick. It hit me that this day would either be everything I dreamed of or the final break with my family. So when mom and Rachel arrived early, I took a deep breath and smiled like nothing had ever been wrong. I'm so glad you made it, I said, hugging them both. You have to see how beautiful everything turned out. I showed them around the lobby, pointing out the flowers and the way the sunlight hit the stained glass. The bridal sweets over here, I said, keeping my tone light. You can see the aisle from this angle. It's perfect. Right? Then I LED them toward the nursery. And remember the room I mentioned? The one with the perfect view of the ceremony. You'll love this. The room was just as I planned. Soft lighting, padded carpet, a big screen showing the ceremony room. I smiled as they stepped inside. It's soundproof, I said. Parents can bring their babies here and still hear everything from the main hall. Mom walked in first, Rachel close behind, still talking about the decorations. I'll step out to the reception hall and say something. So you can test how well it works, I said, keeping my tone light. They both nodded, turning towards the screen. I slipped out, hold the door closed and turn the lock. For a second, I just stood there, palm flat against the cool metal, my heart pounding so hard it hurt. Twenty eight years of being the good daughter ended with one small click. The pounding started immediately. Mom's muffled yelling, Rachel's ha, ha! Ha! Echoing through the padded walls. But those walls were built to muffle crying babies, and they worked. I walked back to the bridal suite. The makeup artist glanced up, startled at my calm face. For the first time in my life, silence didn't mean waiting for the next outburst. It meant peace. I stepped into my dress. It felt like armor. An hour later, I stood at the altar, watching my husband's face as he read his vows. His voice never wavered. Every word exactly as he'd written them, exactly as I'd dreamed. The ceremony was perfect silence. After the reception, I played dumb. Oh, my god, that door has been sticking! I told the venue about it last week. Thank goodness you could watch on the screen. Mom's face turned red. She didn't speak, just glared like I'd committed murder. After I forced her to watch my husband's parents walk me down the aisle. Before mom left the church that day, she cornered me, her face twisted with rage. You're dead to me, She hissed, I smiled. Yeah, I Learned from the best.

Why didn't anyone know? Sarah demanded. Because grandma asked me to keep it quiet. She wanted to see what Frank would do. Whether he'd honor her wishes or try to cash out this. This fraud. Frank slammed his hand on the table. You manipulated her. She was senile. She wasn't senile. I have medical records proving she was mentally competent. Her doctor signed off. Her lawyer was present at the transfer. What lawyer? Martin Chen. He's been the family attorney for 30 years. You know him? Frank pulled out his phone, started dialing. Don't bother, I said. He's expect in your call. I told him this conversation was happening today. Frank's finger hovered over the screen. Grandma knew you'd sell, I continued. She told me about the developer who'd been calling you for years. She knew you'd take it the second she was gone, so she gave it to you. Tim asked. Why you? Because I'm the only one who visits the farm every week. Who fixes the fences, who mows the fields. Who actually gives a damn about keeping it alive. Frank pointed a shaking finger at me. You conned an old woman. I took care of an old woman while you were planning her estate sale. Every Sunday for five years, I was there. Where were you? Silence! I asked her once why she didn't just leave it to all of us. I said, you know what she told me? I'm leaving it to the one who'll fight for it. The rest will just fight over it. Sarah started crying. This isn't fair! What's not fair is Frank telling everyone the farm is his when he never bothered to check. What's not fair is 40 people nodding along while he plans to pave over grandma's legacy for a shopping mall. Two million dollars! Frank shouted. Do you know what that could do for this family? I know exactly what it would do. You take the money, divide it up, and in five years nobody would remember there was ever a farm. So what are you going to do? Tim asked quietly. Keep it? Yeah, I'm keeping it. You can't afford that, Frank said. You're a teacher. You make nothing. I make enough. Full story on the channel linked below.

I said, you've been managing it into the ground. The barns falling apart, the fences are broken. Half the fields are overgrown. That's because nobody helps, Frank shouted. None of you ungrateful kids ever lifted a finger. You just showed up for Sunday dinners and acted like you own the place. Grandma wanted us to have Sunday dinners there. She wanted it to stay in the family. Well, Grandma's dead, Frank said, and I'm the executor of her estate. The farm goes to me. What I do with it is my business. My cousins looked at their plates. Nobody argued. Did you actually read the will, I asked? Of course. I read it. I'm not an idiot. And you check the deed at the county office. Frank laughed. Why would I need to check?

My sister Rachel has Tourette's. That makes her elbow. People stomp and yell ha, ha, ha! Loud enough to stop conversations three rooms away. It started long before I ever understood what it meant. When I was seven, one of her tics grabbed my hair and slammed my head into the wall. Mom didn't ask if I was okay. She just sighed and said, she's having such a hard day. Go play in your room. That moment started a pattern that never stopped. Rachel lashed out, I took it, and mom pretended not to see. Then last winter, I got a taste of a different kind of love. It was New Year's Eve when my. My boyfriend got down on one knee right as the fireworks exploded. He held my face in his hands and said, you deserve to be someone's first priority. I sobbed so hard I could barely say yes. For three days, I called friends, posted pictures, and planned venues. Once, I wasn't the family shock absorber. I was just Lisa, a woman in love planning her perfect day. Then my mom called. I've been saving for this since you were little. Let me pay for everything. Her voice tripped, honey, but I should have heard the poison underneath. We talked flowers and venues for 20 minutes before she dropped it. Of course Rachel will be your Maid of honor standing right behind you during the ceremony. I'm paying so I get to choose at least one bridesmaid. That's the rule. In that instant, every memory I tried to bury came barreling back. See, with Rachel, you had to know the right distance. Three feet was safe from the elbow. Five feet protected you from the stomping. Zero feet meant blood. When I was 12, Rachel threw a dinner plate at my face during Christmas. Seven stitches above my eyebrow. But I had to clean up the blood while mom comforted her. By 16, I Learned to back up everything twice because her stomping tick had destroyed too many of my things. Mom bought Rachel weighted blankets and therapy lamps and told me to be understanding. At 22, I watched Rachel elbow a pregnant woman at our cousin's wedding. The woman doubled over crying, but mom told everyone she was being dramatic. That's when I realized mom wasn't just enabling her. She was protecting the chaos because it kept her in control. So I told her no. Rachel could come to the reception, the rehearsal dinner, everything except the ceremony. I even offered the church nursery so she could watch on a TV screen that. I'm not paying for anything. Mom snapped. Fine, I said. My fiance and I will cover it. The next three weeks were hell. Mom called relatives saying I was able to. And cruel. She showed up at my apartment with Rachel To practice being calm. Ten minutes later, Rachel's elbow shattered my living room mirror. Shards of glass everywhere.

My 16 year old Sophie had been begging for AirPods Pro all summer, the new 300 dollar model. She'd researched every feature, watched countless unboxing videos, even created a detailed comparison chart showing why the Pro version was essential for her aesthetic. Her birthday arrived and I surprised her with the exact model. I was so proud finding them in stock when they'd been sold out everywhere. Her face dropped the second she opened the box. Um, these are the regular AirPods Pro. She held them like they were defective. I specifically said I need the AirPods Pro Max. Everyone at school has the Max version now. These make me look poor. The Max version. This kid wanted the $600 over ear headphones that cost more than my car payment. Her music career consisted of making 15 second TikTok dance videos to trending songs. The Pro version has the same sound quality I explained trying to salvage the moment. These are what actual musicians use for professional work. Mom, nobody cares about sound quality. It's about the look. These tiny earbuds are so basic. The max ones are a statement piece. Was already putting them back in the box. Can you just return these and get the right ones? It's only like 300 bucks more. Only 300 bucks more. Like I was made of money that's stung deep. I'd specifically researched which model music professionals recommended. I'd read reviews, compared features. Even asked my friend who works in audio production. I'll think about it, I said quietly, taking the box from her. She was already back on her phone. Thanks, mom. You're the best. Make sure you get the space grey ones, not silver. Silver looks cheap on camera. I just nodded and walked away. Next day, I'm at Apple store standing in the return line, still feeling terrible about the whole situation. The line was moving slowly and I could hear the customer service conversation happening ahead of me. I'm sorry, ma'am, your card was declined again. Do you want to try a different payment method? I looked up from my phone. A woman about my age wearing scrubs with Maria embroidered on them was standing there with her teenage son. He couldn't have been older than 15, wearing a faded band T-shirt and holding her hand supportively. Um, let me try this one, Maria said, pulling out a different card. Her hands were shaking slightly. Sorry, Miguel. I thought I had enough after paying rent. This one declined too, the employee said gently. The boy immediately stepped forward. It's okay, mom. I don't really need new earbuds for school. My old ones still work fine for online classes. Maria's shoulders sagged like someone had just crushed her dreams. Miho, you've been using those broken earbuds for two years. The left one doesn't even work anymore. And you need them for your virtual music lessons. Maybe next month I'll have Better tips from work, she said, her voice cracking. Your music teacher said you have real talent. You deserve proper equipment. Mom, sharing one earbud with my study group is fine. Besides, my music sounds better when we listen to.

My little sister demanded I teach my study partner how to braid hair because she was convinced we were secretly in love. Emily was 8 and had this weird obsession with my chemistry study partner Conrad. Every Tuesday and Thursday when he'd come over, she'd magically appear with some urgent eight year old business. Can I show you my rock collection? Do you wanna see me do a cartwheel? Did you know I lost a tooth yesterday? Conrad was incredibly patient with her, always stopping whatever we were doing to admire her latest drawing or listen to her explain why unicorns were scientifically possible. I kept apologizing but he just laugh and say she reminded him of his little cousins back home. He actually seemed to enjoy her interruptions, which made me like him even more. One Thursday, Emily cornered me in the kitchen while Conrad was in the bathroom. You need to teach Conrad how to braid hair, she whispered urgently. Why would I do that, em? Because when you guys get married and have daughters, he'll need to know how to do their hair for school. It's basic dad requirements. I nearly choked on my water. We're not getting married.

I thought everyone heard the vacuum cleaner screaming when it turned on. For years my parents told me I was being dramatic when I covered my ears during everyday stuff. Turns out I wasn't dramatic at all. When I was little, probably like three or four, I'd always ask my mom why the T. V. Was so loud. Check the volume and it would be on like 15, which is pretty normal, but to me it sounded like someone was yelling in my ear. My parents thought I was just being a weird kid. As I got older, things got worse. Started wearing these chunky noise cancelling headphones to school assemblies because the microphone feedback made me wanna throw up. During fire drills I would literally hide under my desk crying because the alarm felt like someone was stabbing my eardrums with a fork. The school nurse started calling my parents saying I was having panic attacks during normal school activities. My mom took me to our family doctor when I was 8. He did the basic hearing test where you raise your hand when you hear the beep. My hearing was perfect, so he said I probably had anxiety. That's when the real nightmare started. Every little sound became torture. The microwave beeping sounded like a fire truck Siren. When my dad would start his car in the garage, I could feel the engine vibrations. In my chest, and it made me dizzy and sick. Stopped eating dinner with my family because the sound of forks scraping plates made me want to scream. My parents were getting frustrated with me. My mom would say stuff like, normal people don't get panic attacks from the dishwasher running. My dad thought I was making it up for attention. They sent me to a counselor who gave me breathing exercises and told me to download meditation apps. By the time I turned 14, I couldn't function anymore. I stopped riding in cars because the engine noise made me nauseous. Flowers hurt my ears so bad, I could only take them for, like, two minutes. I couldn't go to restaurants because the sound of people talking mixed with plates clinking. Sounded like metal scraping against metal. One day during sophomore year, we had a fire drill, and I completely lost it. I collapsed in the hallway, sobbing and shaking. Sound was so overwhelming, I thought my head was going to explode. Three teachers had to carry me to the nurse's office. Most of my teachers thought I was being overdramatic, but my substitute science teacher, Mrs. Lopez

My daughter had asked to sleep in my room for the third time in a row. She's 5, so I assume she was having nightmares or maybe she was going through a clingy phase. When she asked for the fourth time, I said yes. And as I was tucking her in, I asked why she kept asking to sleep in my room. She couldn't look at me as she told me, because mommy's friend gets into bed with me when you're gone. Her words didn't fully register at first. I asked her what she meant and she repeated it, adding that Mommy says it's okay because he's like family. I couldn't sleep at all that night. The next morning, I told my wife what our daughter had said and asked if anyone had been over recently. She brushed it off almost instantly, laughing a little and saying our daughter probably meant a stuffed animal or had made something up. She said, you know how kids are and change the subject. The way she said it was off as if she was prepared for that question and had her answer ready. A few days later, I told her I had to leave town for a short work trip. In reality, I stayed in a nearby hotel and logged into the security cameras I had installed last year after a neighbor's house had been broken into. I'd almost forgotten they were even still Active the next day. I got a motion alert around nine thirty PM from the hallway camera. I opened the feed. I saw a man I didn't recognize. He kissed my wife who entered our bedroom right after. But the man kept walking through the hallway and went straight into my daughter's room. He just walked in like he belonged there and my wife was fine with it. I was so scared for my daughter. I instantly got in my car and drove straight home. When I walked through the door, I didn't say a word, not even when my wife popped out of our room and nervously asked me what I was doing back home so early. I pushed past her and went into my daughter's room. I turned the light on.

The parents gave me a horrifying set of rules. I thought I hit the Jackpot when the Morrison family offered me $300 to babysit their daughter for one night. I had no idea this would be the last normal day of my life. The job seemed perfect, rich neighborhood, well behaved kid, easy money. What could go wrong? Everything, apparently. I arrived at their mansion on Elm Street. Mrs. Morrison answered the door looking absolutely exhausted, dark circles under her eyes, hands shaking slightly as she spoke. Thank god you're here, Riley, she said, practically pulling me inside. We haven't had a night out in months. Mr Morrison came downstairs carrying their seven year old daughter, Sophie. The little girl was adorable with curly blonde hair and big blue eyes, but something felt off. She didn't smile when she saw me. She just stared. Before we leave, Mrs. Morrison said, handing me several folded papers. These are very important instruction. Please follow them. Exactly. Sophie special. I nodded, stuffing the papers in my pocket without reading them. Mistake. They left in a hurry, practically running to their car. I should have known something was wrong when they didn't even say goodbye to Sophie. The first few hours went great. Sophie and I watched cartoons, played board games, ate pizza. She was sweet and polite, nothing like the weird, difficult kids I usually dealt with. Around 7:30, she yawned and said she was getting tired. What time is Your bedtime, I asked. Mommy says I have to be in my room with the door locked by eight PM she said, matter of factly lock. That seemed weird, but rich parents had strange rules sometimes. I figured I'd check the instructions once I got her settled, I tucked Sophie into her bed at 7:55. As I was leaving, she grabbed my arm. Don't forget to lock the door, she whispered urgently. And whatever you hear tonight, don't come back in here. Promise me. Why would I need to promise me, she said, her grip tightening. Okay, okay, I promise. I closed her door and noticed the heavy duty lock installed on the outside. Not a regular bedroom lock. This was the kind they used in psychiatric hospitals. My hands were shaking as I turned the key downstairs. I finally pulled out Missus Morrison's instruction. What I read made my blood turn to ice. Dear Riley, thank you for watching Sophie tonight. She is not like other children. At exactly eight fifteen PM, you will hear scratching coming from her room. This is normal. Do not unlock her door no matter what you hear at eight thirty PM

My wife Jenna has this thing where she's always late, not just fashionably late, but like 30 to 45 minutes late to everything, dinner with friends, movies, work meetings, family gatherings, you name it, she's gonna be late for it. It drives me absolutely insane. The worst part is how she acts about it like it's no big deal. She'll roll her eyes when I tell her we need to leave, say, relax, babe, we have time, when we absolutely don't, and then get mad at me for being stressed about it. I've started telling her events start an hour earlier than they actually do, but she caught on and now just shows up even later. Last month was the breaking point. We were supposed to meet my parents for my dad's birthday dinner at this nice restaurant. I told her we needed to leave by 6:30 to get there on time. At 7:15, she's still doing her makeup, telling me to chill out because they'll wait for us. We showed up at 8:20. My parents had already ordered appetizers and were halfway through their main course. My dad looked hurt, my mom was pissed, and I wanted to disappear. But two weeks ago, something happened that Jenna had been talking about for months. Her favourite singer was doing this acoustic set at a tiny venue downtown She'd been refreshing the ticket page for weeks trying to get seats and somehow managed to snag two tickets when someone cancelled last minute. She was beyond excited, posting about it on Instagram every day, telling everyone at work about it. The show was at eight PM on a Saturday. The venue was small, maybe 50 people max, and they were super strict about their no late entry policy.

I laughed, because what else do you do when someone says something that insane? Marcus wasn't laughing. His face stayed dead serious. He reached for my hand, started rubbing circles in my palm like he always did to calm me. It's how we make sure the bride is pure, he said. I couldn't wrap my head around it.

About how her own mother has spent two and a half decades disrespecting her husband in a language she thought I couldn't understand. About how you've been planning to manipulate your inheritance to make sure I know my place behind them. I saw Mira walk into the kitchen doorway. From the look on her face, she'd heard at least the last part. How long? She asked me quietly. Since the engagement dinner. My mother in law turned around and saw her daughter standing there. She started speaking rapidly in Korean, but I cut her off in English. Mira deserves to understand every word this time.

Cameron was the reason bullying basically didn't exist at our school anymore. He started the zero tolerance movement freshman year after watching someone get tormented in the cafeteria and deciding he was done being a bystander. Teachers loved him because he actually got results. Principal put him in charge of the entire anti bullying program. By sophomore year, he created the anonymous reporting system where anyone could submit evidence of bullying and Cameron would personally make sure something was done about it. He won the state Youth Leadership award two years in a row and got featured in the local news three times. Cameron system was so effective that teachers started sending kids to him instead of handling discipline themselves. A freshman got called a name in gym and the teacher you said go report that to Cameron. Instead of dealing with it, Cameron made this senior do a public apology in front of the whole cafeteria for making fun of someone's haircut. The kid had to stand on a chair and read a statement Cameron had written for him while everyone watched. It was humiliating but everyone thought the bully deserved it. The wall of shame account became legendary. Cameron would post screenshots with captions like this is what a bully looks like at our school with the person's Instagram handle tagged. One post guy kids college acceptance rescinded because the admissions office saw it. Cameron said it. Was consequences for actions. People were terrified of ending up on that account. Kids deleted entire group chats in case Cameron got access. When someone started a rumor about this girl, Cameron didn't just stop the rumor. He found out who started it, posted their photo and organized the petition to get them expelled. They got 300 signatures in two days. The school suspended them for a month. Cameron threw a victory Celebration for the girl who'd been targeted. He treated every case like a war he had to win. By senior year, Cameron had more power than most teachers. Get you suspended just by submitting enough reports. Through his app, he could destroy your reputation by posting you on wall of shame. He could turn the entire school against you if he decided you were guilty. And everyone loved him for it because he was protecting victims. Anti bullying summit was supposed to be his crowning achievement. The district was going to adopt his program system wide. He was on stage talking about accountability and justice, using words like eradicate and eliminate when talking about bullies. Then someone stood up in the back, a teenager and an older woman. They walked toward the stage and everyone went quiet. The kid reached for Cameron's microphone. Can I say something? Cameron's whole body went rigid. He set the mic down without saying a word.

They're Korean. And from day one they made it clear I wasn't good enough, too white, too poor, wrong background. At our engagement dinner, my mother in law said something in Korean while looking directly at me. My wife's sister laughed so hard she almost choked on her water. When I asked what was funny, they exchanged glances and said, just an inside joke. You wouldn't understand and kept speaking Korean the rest of the night. Here's the thing, though. I speak Korean fluently. I studied it in college, lived in Seoul for two years teaching English and continued practicing after I moved back. But I never told them why. Because what my mother in law actually said that night was at least the grandchildren will look Korean. So I made a choice. For 25 years, I've sat through every family dinner, every holiday gathering, every birthday party listening to them trash talk me in Korean while I smiled and nodded like an oblivious idiot. I heard every insult, every cruel joke, every comment about how Mira could have done better. When our son was born, my sister in law said in Korean, thank god he has her eyes and not his. At our 10th anniversary, my mother in law told her friends still waiting for Mira to wake up and leave him. Last Christmas, while I was carving the Turkey, they discussed whether my American Laziness was genetic and would affect our kids work ethic. My wife Mira doesn't speak Korean. Her parents never taught her, saying she needed to focus on being properly American for school. The irony isn't lost on me. I kept my secret because I figured their opinion didn't matter as long as Mira loved me, and she does. We've built an incredible life together. But last week, something happened that made me finally break my silence. We're at my daughter's college graduation party. Big Celebration at our house. Both families there, about 40 people total. I'm in the kitchen grabbing more drinks from the garage fridge when my mother in law and sister in law walk in, speak in Korean. They don't see me behind the open pantry door. He's getting fat. Did you see his stomach? I know. Poor Mira. Remember that doctor she dated before him? Park's son? He just bought his third house. At least the kids look Korean. Thank god they don't have his ugly nose and they got Mira.

My sister Felicity was halfway down the aisle when I realised the champagne I just sipped tasted wrong, bitter and chalky with this weird metallic aftertaste that made my tongue feel thick. I set the glass down on my lap and tried to focus on the ceremony, but my vision started getting blurry around the edges. The string quartet playing Cannon and d sounded like it was underwater and far away, even though they were only 20 feet from where I sat in the second row. My hands started tingling first, then my feet. And I looked down at the champagne flute, realizing something was seriously wrong with whatever I just drunk. I tried to stand up to get help, but my legs wouldn't cooperate and I ended up half falling into the aisle. Felicity's new mother in law, Diane, rushed over and grabbed my arm hard enough to bruise, yanking me back into my seat with surprising strength for someone in her 60s. She hissed in my ear that I was making a scene at my sister's wedding and needed to sit down and be quiet, quiet like a proper bridesmaid. I tried to tell her something was wrong with my drink, but my words came out slurred and wrong, like my mouth wasn't working right anymore. Diane leaned in closer and whispered that she, I knew exactly what I'd done, that she'd watched me Trying to steal attention from Felicity all week, my vision tunneled even more and I could feel my pulse hammering in my neck and temples while sweat started soaking through my bridesmaid dress. The efficient was asking if anyone objected to the marriage, and I wanted to scream and that someone had poisoned me. But Diane's hand clamped over my mouth before I could make a sound. She pressed so hard I tasted blood from where my teeth cut into my lip. And her other hand stayed locked around my arm, keeping me pinned to that chair. I tried to bite her hand or scratch her or do anything to get free, but my body felt like it was moving through syrup and nothing worked the way it should. The ceremony kept going while I felt myself slipping further away from consciousness. I could hear the vows being exchanged, but they sounded muffled and distant, like I was listening from the bottom of a swimming pool. Diane finally let go of me once the kiss happened and everyone started clapping, and I immediately slumped forward onto the person in front of me. They turned around looking irritated until they saw my face and their expression changed to concern. People started noticing and a few guests gathered around asking what was wrong while I lay there unable to move or speak properly. My chest felt tight and breathing was getting harder with each attempt. And I realized with absolute terror that This wasn't just being drunk or having a panic attack. Someone had actually poisoned that champagne and I was dying right there on the ground at my sister's outdoor wedding. Diane pushed through the small crowd and announced loudly that I was clearly drunk and had embarrassed myself in the family. She told everyone to give me space and let me sleep it off in one of the back rooms at the Venue. 2 groomsmen picked me up under Diane's direction and started carrying me away from the ceremony area. I tried to tell them I needed a hospital, that someone poisoned me, but all that came out was garbled nonsense that made them laugh like I was just really wasted. They hauled me up the back stairs of the mansion and into a small storage room that smelled like dust and old furniture, then dumped me on a moth eaten couch before leaving and closing the door behind them. I heard the lock click and realized Diane had just had me imprisoned in this room while whatever was in that champagne worked its way through my system. My almost back at my seat and there was no way to call for help. The room had no windows, just shelves of old decorations and boxes stacked against the walls. I don't know how long I lay there drifting in and out of consciousness, but at some point I heard voices outside the door. Diane was talking to someone about how I'd always been jealous of Felicity and had probably taken something to get attention. I tried to scream to let them know I was actually dying, but my voice wouldn't work anymore. The footsteps walked away and I was alone again. With my heart beating irregularly and my breathing getting shallower, the edges of my vision went completely black and I felt myself slipping away, wondering if anyone would even notice I was gone until it was too late. And that's when the door locked behind me. The rest of the story is linked below or on my channel.

So I bought carnivorous plants and place them next to hers. I'd lived with Amanda for three years in our two bedroom apartment. She was vegan since 14, had plants everywhere and we never had issues. I ate my steaks, made her quinoa bowls. Life was balanced. Amanda was obsessed with her plants. 47 different species across our apartment. Succulents on window sills, ferns hanging from ceilings, some tropical thing in a humidity tent. She named them all. If you bumped one, you got a death stare that could wilt the plants themselves. Then two months ago, Amanda went to an animal rights conference. I'm back a different person, suddenly attending rallies every weekend, wearing aggressive vegan shirts, posting constantly on social media. I came home one Thursday with leftover steak. Amanda walked in and lost it. 10 minute rant about animal suffering. How could I look at myself eat meat? Made me a bad person. I tried laughing it off. We'd always respected each other's choices. She said that was before she saw the light and couldn't stay silent while I participated in murder. This became daily. Every time she saw me eating non vegan food, she'd make comments, enjoying your corpse or that chicken had a family. It got so bad I started eating bread first in my car at 5:00am. My coworkers thought I was insane. Why are you eating oatmeal in the parking lot? Because my roommate Became the vegan police. That's why three weeks of this. Finally I told her, if this continues, I'm moving out. She crossed her arms. Good. I'll be glad when I don't have to live with an animal murderer. That's when creative inspiration hit. I mentioned her avocados probably killed more beings through monoculture than my eggs. She exploded saying I didn't appreciate her efforts to save the planet. We were done. Least ended in two months. But I wasn't leaving quietly. Next day while she was at a rally, I drove to an exotic plant store 20 minutes away, asked the owner, what's the most dramatic carnivorous plant you have? He showed me everything. Venus fly traps, pitcher plants, sundews, butterworts. I bought 12 different carnivorous plants, specialized pots, hanging fixtures, nutrient poor soil they need. Cost nearly $300. Spent three hours setting up key detail, didn't touch Amanda's plants. Instead placed mine directly beside hers. Everywhere she had a plant, mine flanked it. Kitchen became ground zero. Her windowsill herbs now beside pitcher plants. Her pothos on the fridge. Meet Venus flytrap named Rib Eye. Her fiddle leaf fig. Say hello to sundew called brisket. Made little name tags. Rib eye, porterhouse brisket, t bone, sirloin, bacon. Every carnivorous plant got a meat name.

I said, prove it. Then I moved out that night and started dating her untouchable model friend who had been secretly in love with me. I, 29, ma'am, was washing dishes last Wednesday when my fiance, Kelsey, 27, dropped the most arrogant statement I'd ever heard. We were arguing about her spending one $200 on a designer bag when we were supposed to be saving for the wedding. She slammed her fresh manicure on the counter. You know what, Ethan? I could replace you in 24 hours. Literally. Guys are lined up waiting for me to be single. You should be grateful I even chose you. I stopped washing, turned off the water, dried my hands slowly. Prove it. She laughed. That mean girl. Laugh. What? You said 24 hours. Prove it. We're done. Clock starts now. I checked my phone. 7:23 p m. Wednesday. Her face went through confusion, amusement, anger, then smug confidence. You're bluffing. You can't even match your socks without me. I walked to the bedroom and started packing. She followed, listing reasons I'd fail. You don't know the Netflix password. Your mom likes me more. Good luck finding someone who looks like me. You're literally nothing without me. That last one made me pause. Not because it hurt, but because I realized she actually believed it. Three years fit in two suitcases and a backpack. As I was leaving, my phone buzzed. Adrian Kelsey's best friend. The one she called untouchable because she only dated millionaires. Heard you're single. Kelsey's already posting. You okay me heading to Jerome's? Adrian come to mine instead. We need to talk now. I showed up at 9 p m. She opened the door in sweats and a messy bun. Before you say anything, I need to tell you something I should have said two years ago. She showed me texts with Kelsey from 2022. My stomach dropped. Kelsey Ethan's getting too comfortable thinking about monkey branching to that lawyer guy from Pilates. Adrian that's messed up. Ethan's a good guy. Kelsey good. Doesn't pay for Mycanoe trips, but he's stable until I find better. Already added myself as authorized user on his AMX. Lol. There were dozens more plans to upgrade me. Her active hinge profile messages about backup guys, why didn't you tell me? I asked. I tried. Kelsey threatened to ruin me if I said anything. Then I've been in love with you since the day I introduced you to her, but I thought she'd be better for you. We talked until 4:00am. She let me crash in her guest room, and I watched Kelsey's replacement speed run. Our 1 6 thirst trap three different bars. Where are all the real men at? Videos got progressively sloppier. Our 7 to 16 matched with 30+ guys. Brought home some guy named Kyle who looked like he sold protein powder. Posted his back with upgrade already. I. Kyle left. She posted and deleted a crying selfie. Our 17 to 24 full panic. Texted me from three numbers. I win. I replaced you became. Can we talk? This isn't what I meant. At seven twenty three PM, Thursday, the 24 hour.

This went on for weeks. I told her multiple times to stop asking because we weren't sharing the name yet. She promised to stop and then the next day the text would start again. I start started just ignoring her when she asked. But that somehow made it worse. My husband and I had already picked out the perfect name months ago. We loved it and didn't want anyone's opinion on it. But we especially didn't want Katie to know because I had this gut feeling she would try to either use it herself or pick something that matched with it. See, Katie has always been a little competitive with me, not in a mean way, but in this weird twin way where she needs us to do everything together. Or similarly, when I got engaged, she got engaged four months later. When I bought a house, she started looking at houses in the same neighborhood. Last week, I finally hit my breaking point when she texted me seven times in one day asking about baby names. That's when Jake suggested we just give her a fake name. At first, I thought it was too mean, but then I thought about it more. Katie thinks any unique name is weird. I once told her years ago that I liked the name Meadow and she acted like I said I wanted to name my kid helicopter. So I figured if I gave her something.

She wasn't falling asleep at the kitchen table after school anymore. Her skin looked better, too, not as pale. Her teacher sent an email saying she was participating more in class. I knew it was working, but I couldn't tell her the truth. The second she found out those juice boxes were healthy, she'd stop drinking them. So I kept up the act. I'd shake my head when I'd see empty boxes in the recycling. I'd say things like, you're going through these too fast, while secretly buying two packs instead of one. Then I got bold with the food. She loved my spaghetti sauce but only ate the noodles with butter at other people's houses. One night I blended up carrots, zucchini and tomatoes and stirred it into the sauce, cooked it down for like two hours so it got really thick. She ate three bowls that night, said it was the best sauce I'd ever made. I started doing it with everything. Sloppy Joe's got blended peppers and onions. Meatloaf got shredded zucchini. I made a huge batch of each every Sunday and put them in containers so she could microwave them for lunch. During the week, she, she'd come home from school and tell me about how the other kids were jealous of her food. Last month, she asked me why my spaghetti sauce was so much better than the jar stuff her friend's mom uses. I told her it was because I Added extra tomato paste and let it cook longer. She believed me, went right back to eating. The juice box thing almost got exposed. Two weeks ago, we were at target and she saw them on sale. She grabbed my arm and pointed at the display all excited. I looked at the label with her standing right there. She was reading the front that said Fruit Punch in big letters. I made sure she didn't flip it around to see the back where it listed all the vegetables. I told her the sale wasn't that good and we'd just get them at our regular store.

The first thing she did was try to get me to do matching baby names. She wanted us to name our babies Edmond and Edward if they were boys, or Ethel and Mabel if they were girls. They kept going on about how cute it would be for twin moms to have matching baby names and how it was meant to be. Here's the problem. Those names are absolutely terrible. Edmond and Ethel sound like they belong to people who died in 1890. I told Katie that me and my husband Jake, were going to pick our own name without worrying about what she chose. She did not take that well. She got all pouty and said I was ruining what could be a special twin moment. Then she switched tactics and started asking me constantly what names we were considering.

It started with these juice boxes she spotted at the grocery store. They had cartoon animals on them and she begged me to buy a pack. I checked the label real quick while she wasn't looking and almost laughed. These things were packed with spinach, kale, beets and had like every vitamin a kid needs. It just tasted like regular fruit punch. I played it cool, told her we could get one pack, but she had to make them last. Can't be drinking sugary juice all day long. She nodded like she understood, but I knew better. This kid would slam three in an hour if I let her. Here's the thing about my stepdaughter. She's 9 and she came to live with us last year after CPS finally got involved with her mom's situation. Her mom used to force feed her stuff as punishment or make her sit at the table for hours staring at cold food. So now she's weird about eating. If something looks too healthy or if I tell her it's good for her, she shuts down completely, won't even try it. The first few months were rough. She'd eat chicken nuggets, plain noodles and maybe some bread. That's it. Her doctor said she was low on basically everything, iron, vitamin d, all of it. But getting her to take those gummy vitamins, forget it. She said they tasted like Medicine and made her gag. So when I found these juice boxes, I saw my chance. I made a huge deal about limiting them, told her one per day, maybe two if she's really good. I even put them on the top shelf of the drink fridge in the garage so she'd think they were special. Within a week, I caught her sneaking out there during her iPad time. She grabbed two boxes and stuffed them in her hoodie pocket. I didn't say anything, just went to the store the next day and bought 6 more packs. Kept that top shelf stocked like it was my job. She started getting smarter about it, too. She'd wait until I was doing laundry or on a work call. Sometimes she'd take one to school in her lunch box. Even though I packed her a Capri Sun, I'd find the empty Capri Sun in her backpack later, still sealed. Made me want to laugh every time. After about a month, I noticed.

Military police specialist was running route security that day, first on scene. I watched him run straight into those flames. No hesitation. Pulled out all three soldiers while ammunition was cooking off inside. Burned his hands. Smoke inhalation kept going back. My dad's face went pale. Jenkins continued. Sergeant Collins was there. He was in shock from the blast. We retreating him for head trauma. When the rescue happened, good soldier. But he froze, couldn't move. Totally normal response to an I E. D strike. The room was absolutely silent. Every eye shifted between Marcus and me. The paperwork got mixed up in the chaos. Wards clerk put the wrong name down. By the time anyone realized it, the ceremony had already happened and Sergeant Collins was stateside. Jenkins looked at Marcus. Sir, I think you know this deep down. Marcus's face went bright red. He stood up. Chair scraping loud against the floor. This is bullshit, his voice cracked. He grabbed his jacket and walked out. The door slammed behind him. Jenkins turned to me. We can get this corrected, get you the recognition you actually earned. I shook my head. I didn't Do it for medals. I just wanted them to come home. The words came out quieter than I meant. They had. Families in that room nodded. They understood. But my dad just sat there staring at that display case like it had turned into something poisonous. We drove home in complete silence. Marcus won't return my calls. Dad can't look at me. Last night, my mom finally said something. I always knew you did more than you told us. Six years. Six years of being invisible while my brother wore my moment around his neck. And now that everyone knows the truth, my family is fractured into pieces. The veterans respect me now, but I'd almost rather have my family back, even if it meant staying invisible forever.

I came home to my dad asking if I'd written any speeding tickets or over there every Thanksgiving, every Christmas, every fourth of July barbecue for the past six years, that metal comes out. Dad keeps it in this fancy wooden display case and he sets it right in the middle of the table like a centerpiece.

And I sit there eating potato salad while dad beams and says things like, now that's a real soldier. That's what service looks like. Then he turns to me. You were just doing police work, right? Checking IDS at the gate. I'd correct him. I was route security, criminal investigations, detaining operations. He'd wave his hand, sure, sure. But Marcus was really in it. You know, my uncle once asked what I did over there. And before I could answer, dad jumped in. He was basically a cop, wrote reports while the real soldiers fought. Marcus never corrected him, just smiled and changed the subject. I stopped trying to explain what MPs actually do stopped mentioning the convoys, the raids, the times we were first on scene didn't matter. I wasn't infantry, so I wasn't really a veteran in their eyes. Last Tuesday, there was a veterans town hall at the VFW in our hometown, mental health resources, VA benefits, that, that kind of thing. Marcus and I both went. Dad came, too. And I swear to god he brought the metal case, set it on the table next to his coffee like he was Marcus's manager or something. During the open discussion, this guy in his 40s stood up, Corporal Jenkins. I recognized him immediately from our deployment. He'd been in Marcus's unit. I wanna talk about something that's been bothering me for years, Jenkins said. He pointed at.

He didn't. Then it kept happening because she needed to be sure he'd eventually come to his senses and end it. He never did. She actually sat there listing dates and locations like she was reading a grocery list. The conference room at his office when I was visiting my sister, our bed when I was at my book club, her apartment every Thursday when I thought she had therapy. Six months of lying to my face while claiming she was protecting me. The worst part was how she acted like I should thank her. She literally said, I was lucky to find out now before we had kids, that she saved me from wasting more years on him, that a real friend would do this for someone they loved. I stood up, through $40 on the table and walked out. She followed me to my car, still explaining how this was actually a good thing. I drove straight home, packed Brian's things while he was at work. Everything he owned fit in six garbage bags. I left them on the lawn with a note that said Lisa could help him move since they were so close. Then I called my lawyer cousin about divorce papers. Brian came home early, found his stuff outside, started banging on the door. I didn't answer. He went to stay with his brother. Lisa kept texting me essays about How she sacrificed herself for our friendship. How sleeping with my husband was the hardest thing she'd ever done, but she loved me enough to do it. The delusion was unreal. She even asked if I wanted details about what positions he liked so I'd know for my next relationship. I blocked her on everything. Brian tried to apologize through his brother, said Lisa pursued him aggressively and he was weak. His brother actually agreed with him until I explained Lisa's loyalty test story. Then even his brother called him pathetic. The divorce papers were filed within a week. I'm taking the house since it was my grandmother's. Yesterday, I heard from a mutual friend that Lisa was confused why everyone was taking my side. She apparently told everyone she exposed Brian's cheating to save me, leaving out the part where she was the one he cheated with. But people figured it out when Brian drunkenly admitted everything at a bar. Now she's calling around crying that she lost her best friend trying to help me. The mutual friend asked if I wanted to reconcile once Lisa apologized properly. I said Lisa could test someone else's husband's loyalty. I'm done being her friend.

Lisa and I had been friends since college. We were roommates freshman year, got matching tattoos at 19, held each other through every breakup. When I married Brian four years ago, she was my maid of honour. She gave this beautiful speech about how she'd never seen me happier, how Brian was the man I deserved. Everyone cried. She helped me pick my dress, planned my bachelorette party, fixed my veil when it got caught in the church door. After the wedding, she was at our house constantly, Sunday dinners, random movie nights. She had a key for emergencies. Brian liked her, too, said I was lucky to have such a loyal friend. When Lisa's mom got cancer last year, I drove her to every single appointment, held her hand during the bad news, made sure she ate, basically moved her into our spare room for three months. Brian was amazing, too. He'd pick up her prescriptions, fix things at her apartment while she was at the hospital. We were her family. Her mom recovered, thank god. And Lisa said she owed us everything. Two months ago, Lisa started acting weird. She'd cancel plans last minute, barely text back, showed up late to my birthday dinner. I figured work stress. She was always complaining about her new boss. Ryan was acting strange, too, working late more often, keeping his phone face down. Showering the second he got home. I thought maybe he was planning something for our anniversary. Last Tuesday, Lisa asked me to lunch, said she had something important to tell me. I thought maybe she was dating someone new. We sat down at our usual spot and before I even ordered, she said she'd been sleeping with Ryan for six months. My brain just stopped. She kept talking, though, said she did it for me, that she needed to test if he was really loyal, if he'd resist temptation, that she'd been trying to seduce him to see if he was worthy of me, like she was doing me some kind of favor. She said the first time was after my birthday party when I went to bed early with a headache.

They've never been here. He made a sound halfway between a scream and a sob. I put them in a taxi Thursday morning. If you sent them Thursday, they've been missing for three days. He started screaming. I could hear Olivia in the background asking what was wrong. He couldn't even form words. I hung up, called 9 1 1, then pulled every contact I had. Patrol officer, friend, dispatch connection, search and rescue contact. Within an hour, three officers worked the case with. Then two. They tracked the taxi the driver dropped kids at 14 87 Maple street. Hour three, police located the house. Kids were safe. Helen had protected them. I drove there immediately. Seeing them in that strange house broke something in me. They ran to me crying, I've got you. You're safe. Isaac was at my apartment, pounding my door when he saw us. Relief mixed with rage. Where were they? Three days at a stranger's house. But I gave your address. Wrong address. And you never followed up? Never confirmed arrival. Just assumed. Excuses started. He'd been busy. The trip was booked. You need to leave tomorrow. We're explaining to child services why you ship children to someone who said no. You're ruining my life over a mistake. You made it. I'm documenting it. Monday, I contacted CPS. Full timeline, police reports, statements. Investigation opened immediately. Olivia had no idea. Isaac told her the kids were with his parents. Sent Old photos. Finding out they'd been lost three days while he lied broke her. She moved out within a week. Filed for separation. Court was brutal. Isaac claimed vindictiveness. His lawyer called it honest error. The judge disagreed. Children under 8 sent alone with no verification, no follow up for 72 hours. Criminal negligence. Isaac lost custody. Supervised visitation only. Olivia won full custody. Isaac got every other weekend. Supervised child support and a criminal record. Lost his job over child endangerment charges. Six months later, Isaac called from different numbers. Voicemails about how I destroyed his life. I saved them, but never responded. I didn't destroy his life. He did when he chose convenience over safety. Years later, Marie's 14, wants to be a lawyer. Owen's 12, into computers. Thriving with Livia. Isaac tried reconnecting recently. They're not interested. Old enough to understand, old enough to choose. I'm just the aunt who said no and meant it.

I had no chance with her anymore. Thirty seconds left. Jack is still staring, still going, face getting redder. I grab paper and write the fastest note of my life to the teacher. My handwriting looks like a drunk spider, but whatever. Jack is doing inappropriate things aimed at me. Please help now. I fold it and speed walk it to Evans's desk, reads it. His eyes scan it once, twice. For a second, I think he understand what's going on. But then he scrunches it up and wraps it into a ball, throws it in the trash. Back to your seat now, sir. Please. Back to your seat. Jack is watching me walk back, still smirking, still going. He's not even trying to hide it anymore because he knows Evans won't do anything. The whole situation is about to get so much worse. And Evans is just sitting there grading papers. Lucy is passing notes. Now other kids are starting to notice. The whole room knows what's happening except the one adult who's supposed to stop it. I turn my chair sideways. Jack adjusts his angle like he's got some kind of targeting system. Mr Evans shouted again, face your chair forward. Last warning. He's about to. One more word and it's Saturday detention. Lucia stands up. Mr Evans, everyone, eyes on your own work. Jack's breathing got Faster. His face went from red to purple, his whole body tensing up. And I could see the exact moment he was about to lose it. Time slowed down. I could hear my heartbeat in my ears. I knew I had maybe three seconds before no nut November became the worst month of my life. I threw myself off my chair like I was dodging a dodgeball, hit the ground just as Jack finished his little personal project into his bookbag instead of my face. The room went dead silent except for the clock ticking and someone going, oh, my gosh. Fast forward a week later and Jack followed me into the bathroom and started doing it again. But he wasn't ready for the pocket snake that I threw at him. And let's just say he never lost no nut November again.

No nut November. I used to have a best friend named Jack. Everything was cool until he started making gay jokes. He wasn't even gay. He was just trying to be annoying. It started small at first. Normal joked about me being handsome and stuff like that. But within weeks, the a jokes became his new form of rage bait. He'd make jokes about how I want him. So when we both got detention at the same time, he kept calling it our detention date and making kissy faces when the teacher wasn't looking. We were five minutes into detention when his hand starts moving up and down under the desk at lightning speed and there's no paper on his desk. It was like he was asserting dominance or something, making sure I knew this was about me. He was breathing like he just ran a Marathon while sitting completely still. He looks up right at me, not a glance, full eye contact while his hand is still going full turbo under the desk. My brain just froze like when your computer shows you that spinning wheel of death. Then I noticed his chair. He's turned it toward me and the angle when he finishes, it's gonna hit my face. I had two minutes maybe less. Face was getting red. I tried to reach for the phone in my pocket to text someone to help but the teacher, Mr Evans notices instantly. Phone on my desk. Now Mr Evans has a radar for phones. I swear you know the rules. I walk up and put it on his desk, locks it in his drawer. Great. No lifeline, no evidence, no nothing. While I was walking back, I can see Jack tracking me with his eyes, that same smirk from when he'd make his stupid jokes. But his hand hasn't stopped moving. I get up real quiet and start moving to the empty seat behind him. Where do you think you're going? Evans doesn't even look up. It's a sign, seating only. Go back to your seat. Sir. Sir, I just need to, you need to apologize to Jack for disrupting his concentration and sit back down. Wait, what? I'm sorry. Go on, apologize. I look at Jack, his smirk gets bigger. Sorry, Jack. His voice comes out all breathy and weird. It's cool, bro. Good. Now sit down. The walk back felt like death row. Lucia, the girl I've had a crush on since freshman year, notices what's happening. Her face goes from confused to horrified to buried in her textbook.

Real family only. He said. My wife didn't defend me. I left the party early. By the time they needed me to co sign their mortgage refinance, I was already filing for divorce. My father in law waved me out of the frame. Step back, Jason. Real family only. I stood there holding Emma, my daughter, her first birthday, 50 people watching, pink balloons. My wife's entire family crowded around the cake. I'm her father. I said, you married in. That's different. Frank Jester impatiently. Blood relatives, come on, we're losing the light. My hands went numb. I looked at Sarah, my wife, waiting for her to say something. He avoided my eyes, reached over and took Emma from my arms. The room went silent. 50 people watched me step aside. Frank positioned everyone, smiled, cracked jokes, took a dozen photos. I stood alone against the wall, an outsider at my own daughter's birthday. When the photos finished, Frank walked past me. Nothing personal, just want the bloodline documented properly. I found my keys. Sarah caught me at the door. Where are you going home, Jason? Don't be dramatic. It's just a photo. Your father called me an outsider and you handed him our daughter. He's old fashioned and you're my wife. You should have defended me. She crossed her arms. You're making this bigger than it is. I stared at her, really looked at Her? No. I'm finally seeing it clearly. I left, sat in my driveway for 20 minutes, hands shaking, and I called my lawyer. Monday morning, I filed for divorce. Sarah got served at work. On Thursday, she called me screaming, are you insane? No. I'm done being treated like I don't belong in my own family. Over a photo, over 3 years of being disrespected while you watched. We can fix this. You had your chance when your father called me an outsider. You could have said something. You didn't. I hung up. Her mother called the next day. You're being selfish. Think about Emma. I am thinking about Emma. I'm thinking she deserves a father who doesn't teach her it's okay to let people disrespect her husband. You're tearing this family apart. Your husband did that. When he made it clear I'm not family, I blocked her number. Two weeks of lawyers, mediation, Sarah crying, her family calling me every name in the book. I didn't care anymore. Then Frank called. I almost didn't answer. Jason, we need to talk about what our mortgage, the banks requiring us to refinance. Interest rates went up. His voice.

You just didn't realize it until you needed me. Please tell me again how I'm not real family. The line went quiet. That's what I thought.

Days became weekends. Weekends became constant emergencies. Isaac's surprise work trips were golf weekends. Livia's emergency appointments were spa days. They assumed I wouldn't question family. Three weeks before my first vacation in 18 months, I sent a group text off completely. March 15th to 22nd, phone on silent. Isaac responded with a thumbs up. Three days before vacation, he called.

You're destroying our marriage. When are you going to act like family, Isaac? I've babysat 60 times in two years. I'm being unavailable, not selfish. It's one week to save my marriage. No. Find other childcare. He hung up. Guilt text flooded in from mom, dad, Olivia. I didn't respond. Thursday morning, I woke up, naturally, made breakfast, pure peace. I didn't know was Isaac had decided to force it anyway. He called a taxi at 9:00am, put Marie, 7, and Owen, 5, in the back with a small bag. No note, no call, just shipped them.

Helen was gardening when she found two confused kids on her curb. She assumed they were at the wrong house. Their parents would realize any minute nobody came. Helen brought them inside, gave them juice and cookies. The kids knew they were going to Aunt Nat's but didn't know my address or last name. Evening came, no parents. She made dinner, set up her guest room. Friday passed. Then Saturday, 72 hours in a stranger's house. Saturday evening, my phone rang. Hey, thanks for taking the kids after all, Isaac said, cheerful, ice cold. What? The kids? Thanks for not making a big deal. What kids? Silence. My kids, the ones I sent Thursday.

He just laughed and said it's not his problem. I gave everyone access, said if I didn't want people using it, I shouldn't have shared the password. This kid just graduated high school and acts like he runs the world. So I called my mom and told her everyone needed to chip in for prime or get their own accounts. She got all dramatic and said family should help each other out. She reminded me how she used to buy me clothes when I was younger. I told her that was literally her job as a parent and not the same thing at all then Ashley calls me crying, saying she can't afford her own prime account because she's saving for a wedding. I reminded her that her wedding is in two years and she just spent $300 on workout clothes she returned last month. She said I was being petty and that it's only like $10 a month split between everyone. I did the math. If everyone chipped in 10 bucks, that would actually cover prime and give me extra money. But when I suggested this in our family group chat, suddenly everyone had excuses. My mom said she's on a fixed income. Ashley said she's saving for the wedding. Rick said he barely uses it anyway, which is a lie because he ordered protein powder just yesterday. The final straw was when my grandma called me confused about why her soap order got cancelled. Turns out my account got flagged for suspicious activity because there were so many different addresses. Amazon temporarily locked my account and I couldn't order my medication refills. That's when I snapped. I changed the password and removed everyone's.

I guess disabled people think they're more special than everyone else. She grabbed the handles of my wheelchair and tried to tip me forward to help me out of it. I had to grip the wheels to prevent myself from falling face first onto the concrete. Get your hands off me, I shouted. Her husband Dave came running over with his phone out recording Karen, get it on video. Show everyone how selfish she's being. I'm documenting disability discrimination, Karen announced to the crowd, still gripping my chair. This woman is refusing to share public resources with a child. Public resources? I stared at her in disbelief. This is my wheelchair. I bought it with my insurance for my paralyzed legs. Wheelchair should be community property for educational purposes, she declared, making up policies on the spot. That's when Coach Martinez, a 6 foot 4 inch former college football player stepped in. Ma'am, you need to remove your hands from her wheelchair. Immediately said in a voice that could stop traffic. She's discriminating against my son. Karen protested, finally letting go. No, coach Martinez said. Slowly. You're assaulting a person in a wheelchair on camera that your husband is recording. Dave's face went white as he realized what he'd actually captured. Furthermore, the coach continued asking someone to give up their medical equipment so your kid can try being disabled. Probably the most offensive thing I've heard this season. Pack up and leave, coach Martinez. Said Braden can finish the season with another team. You can't kick us out, Karen shrieked. Actually, I can. It called protecting our Players Families from harassment. Dave was already dragging Karen toward their Tesla, muttering about lawsuits. Karen kept yelling over her shoulder about disability, body privilege and reverse ableism. The next day, Dave's video went viral on social media, but not the way they intended. The comments were universally horrifying them. Within 48 hours, Karen was fired from her job as a school administrator. Dave's law firm quietly suggested he take a sabbatical.

A mom at my daughter's soccer game demanded I give her 8 year old my custom wheelchair because her son really wanted to try it. When I politely declined, she screamed that I was selfish and discriminatory in front of 200 parents. Then she tried to physically remove me from my own mobility device while her husband filmed it, claiming I was hoarding disability resources from able bodied children. I've been paralyzed from the waist down since a car accident. My wheelchair isn't just transportation. It's a 15,000 dollar custom fitted medical device calibrated for my spine and daily needs. Like asking someone to hand over their prosthetic leg so your kid can try being disabled for fun. This kid, maybe 8 years old, became fascinated with my wheelchair at my daughter Emma's soccer practice. Kept asking questions about the wheels, the brakes, how fast it could go. Can I sit in it? He asked innocently. Sorry, buddy, but this is especially made just for me, I explained gently. It wouldn't fit you right? That's when his mother Karen materialized like a helicopter parent superhero. My son Braden asked you a simple question, she said, hands on her hips. The least you could do is let him try it for two minutes. I understand he's curious, but this is medical equipment. It's not safe for someone who doesn't need it. Karen's face flushed red. That's ridiculous. It's just a chair with wheels. Braden has good balance. Ma'am, this chair is calibrated for my specific medical needs. Are you seriously going to deny a child a simple request because you're gatekeeping your disability? She interrupted. That's discrimination against able bodied people. I blinked trying to process the backwards logic. This is literally my legs. Don't be dramatic, she snapped. You're sitting here doing nothing anyway. Braden would actually use it properly. He'd have fun with it instead of just taking up space. Other parents were starting to stare. Emma looked mortified from the field. The answer is no, this isn't a toy. That's when Karen completely lost it. Fine. She screamed loud enough for the entire.

I'm Mike and I have a four year old daughter named Ebony who has absolutely no filter. Last week we were at the grocery store when she made me want to crawl into a hole and disappear forever. We're standing in the checkout line behind this really tall black man who's probably 6 feet 5 inches and built like a basketball player. Ebony is staring at him with that intense kids stare that makes every parent nervous. I'm trying to distract her. Ebony, look at the magazine, look at the candy. But she's completely fixated on this guy. Finally she tugs on my shirt and says in her loudest four year old voice, daddy, why is that man so dark? The entire checkout line goes silent. I want to disappear into the floor. The man turns around with this patient smile that tells me he's dealt with curious kids before. Well, little one, that's just how god made me. Ebony nods seriously, then asks, God run out of the light color when he made you? I'm mortified, Ebony. That's not how. But the man starts laughing. You know what? Maybe he did or maybe he thought dark was more beautiful that day. Ebony considers this. I think you're right. Dark is prettier like chocolate. Thank you, sweetheart. I think we're in the clear. But Ebony is not done. Are you made of chocolate? No. Honey, I'm made of the same stuff you are, but you look like chocolate, the really good kind that mommy hides from me. The man is cracking up now. Well, I do love chocolate. Ebony gets it excited. Me, too. We have so much in common. I'm starting to relax, thinking maybe this isn't so bad. Then Ebony asks, can I lick you to see if you taste like chocolate? Ebony, the entire line bursts in to laughter. The man is doubled over. Sweetie, I don't taste like chocolate. I just look like it. Ebony looks disappointed. That's false advertising. False advertising? Yeah. Mommy says that's when something looks like one thing but it's really something else. Like when cereal boxes have more cereal on the picture than in the box. The man looks at me. Your daughter is very smart.

Jake brought his portable speaker, and we're picking grapes to 90s hip hop like it's some kind of twisted harvest party. Around midnight, we're halfway through row two when my mom starts giggling like a teenager. She's exhausted, but running on pure spite at this point. Maureen's gonna show up tomorrow, and there won't be a single grape left, she keeps saying between fits of laughter. By three a m, we've cleared three full rows, and we're all delirious. Ryan finds this one perfect cluster hanging way up high and makes this whole dramatic speech about it being the chosen grapes before Jake lifts him up to grab them. Sun's starting to come up, and we're on the final row. My dad's passed out in his lawn chair, but he picked for, like, four hours straight. The absolute legend. We're all covered in grape juice and dirt, looking like we survived some kind of agricultural apocalypse. At exactly 7 a m, we hear car doors slamming. Maureen's arrived with what sounds like her entire extended family. I'm hiding behind the fence with Emma, both of us trying not to laugh as we watch Maureen march toward the grapevines with her little army of relatives carrying baskets. Silence was beautiful. You could literally hear her jaw hit the ground when she saw the completely bare vines. Not a single grape left. We'd even gotten the tiny ones that weren't quite ripe yet just to be Extra petty, she starts screaming at my mom, demanding to know what happened to the grapes. My mom, still in her pajamas and covered in grape stains, just shrugs and says, oh, we decided to pick them after all. Maureen's nephew or whoever asks if we left any for them, and my mom points to this one Vine in the corner where there's literally three grapes hanging. Help yourselves, she says with the sweetest smile. Maureen's whole family starts arguing with her about driving all the way over here for nothing. Her daughter's like, mom, you said there would be tons of grapes! And some old dude, who's probably her husband, is complaining about his back hurting for no reason. They all pile back in their cars and leave without a single grape. Meanwhile, we've got enough grapes to make wine for the next five years. My mom spent the whole day making grape juice and calling relatives to give updates like she just won the World Series.

So my parents rent this house with a quarter acre of land, and the landlord lets us pick from these grape vines every year. There's this old lady, Maureen, who used to pick them before we moved in, and she's been nothing but trouble ever since. Every single year, it's the same drama. The landlord already told her we get first dibs because we actually pay rent. But Maureen acts like she owns the place. She's got her own grapes on her property, but apparently, that's not enough for her greedy ass. This year, my mom tells Maureen, we're picking this weekend. Simple enough, right? Wrong. My dad just had major cancer surgery and was still recovering. my mom's usual helper crew all got sick with some nasty stomach bug. So the weekend comes and goes without us getting to the grapes. Monday morning, my mom's phone rings. It's Maureen. And she's got this smug tone like she just won the lottery. She tells my mom that she's coming tomorrow with her whole family to pick all the grapes, since we apparently missed our chance. My mom tries to explain the situation. She's like, Maureen, please. My husband just had surgery for cancer, and everyone who helps me is sick. Can you just wait a few more days? And you know what this heartless witch says? That's too bad. You had your chance. My family is coming tomorrow, and we are picking the grapes. I'm sitting in the kitchen when my mom comes in, absolutely losing it. She's crying and yelling about how Maureen calls herself a Christian, but acts like Satan himself. She tells me the whole story, and I just snap, absolutely not. I tell her we're staying up all night if we have to. We're picking every single grape off those vines. Start calling everyone I know. My girlfriend Emma, my college buddies Jake and Ryan, my cousin Madison, even my mom's work friends. I'm like, emergency. Great mission. Be here by sunset. By 7 p m, we've got 10 people in our backyard looking like we're about to storm the beaches of Normandy. Except instead of machine guns, we got buckets and flashlights. My dad, even though he's supposed to be resting, hobbles out with his walker and grabs a bucket, too. We start with the first row closest to the house. The grapes are perfect. Fat and juicy.

He said if I claimed damage I didn't cause, I could get in serious trouble. Fines, maybe even criminal charges. He told me not to do it. I also posted about it online without details, and two people who said they were lawyers said the same thing. When Jenna came back three days later, I told her I couldn't do it. She started crying, saying she was going to have to declare bankruptcy. She kept saying it was just insurance and they have money and it wouldn't hurt anyone. I felt horrible, but I kept saying no. She got angry and said I was being selfish and that friends help each other. I told her I could help her find a payment plan with the building or maybe a lawyer, but I couldn't lie on an insurance claim. He left and didn't talk to me for two days. Then she showed up again. This time Ashley was with her. They both sat on my couch, and Ashley apologized for causing the whole mess. She said she felt terrible and knew it was her fault. Then Jenna started again about the insurance. She said the building gave her two weeks to pay $8,000 as a down payment or they would start legal action. She really did think she would go bankrupt. I looked at both of them and said I already talked to professionals and They all said this was fraud. I couldn't do it. Ashley got mad. Then she said I was letting Jenna's life get ruined over something that wouldn't even affect me. I asked how it wouldn't affect me if I committed fraud. She. I didn't have an answer. They both left, and Jenna didn't talk to me for another week. During that time, our whole friend group was weirdly quiet. I later found out Jenna had told everyone I was refusing to help her and made it sound like I was the bad guy. Finally, one of our mutual friends named Chris texted me asking what actually happened. I explained everything, including the fraud part. He said that made sense and he didn't blame me. Apparently, Ashley's parents ended up giving her money to pay for half the damage, and Jenna got a payment plan with the building for the rest. She didn't go bankrupt. She didn't even miss any rent payments. But she never apologized to me for asking me to commit fraud twice.

My friend Jenna and I both moved into the same building after college. She got the fourth floor and I got the third one. Saturday morning, she texted our whole friend group saying she wanted to do a rooftop barbecue. She had done these before, but I never went because I don't eat red meat. This time I figured I should actually show up. So I grabbed chips and paper plates from the store. The barbecue was nice. Everyone was drinking and laughing. Our friend Ashley brought this huge grill and cooked burgers and hot dogs for everyone. I just ate the chips I brought and hung out. Around 9 at night, we all went down to Jenna's apartment to watch some reality show about people stuck on an island. Before we left the roof, Jenna and Ashley talked about leaving the grill up there to cool down overnight. They said they would grab it tomorrow. Made sense to me, so I didn't think about it. The show ended around midnight and I went back to my apartment and crashed. The next morning, I woke up to this long email from building management. There was a fire on the roof last night. Someone had dumped hot coals into the plastic trash can up there and the wind made them catch fire again. The email said they had camera footage and key card records and they knew exactly who was responsible. Screenshot The email and sent it to Jenna. She immediately called me freaking out. Apparently after I left, she and Ashley decided to take the grill home that same night. Instead of waiting, Jenna gave Ashley her keys to go up and get it. Ashley thought the coals were cool enough so she just dumped them in the trash can on the roof. The building was saying Jenna was responsible because it was her guest using her key card. The email said the damage was around $15,000. New roof section, new trash area, new door because the smoke messed up the sensors. A week went by and Jenna came to my apartment. She looked terrible, like she hadn't been sleeping. She asked if I could claim the fire damage on my renters insurance. I was confused at first. She explained that neither her nor Ashley had renters insurance and the building was threatening to sue her. She said if I claimed it on mine, we could just say I was up there, too and it would all go away. I told her I needed to think about it. I called my old insurance agent from when I lived with my parents. He was this older guy who always gave me good advice. I explained the whole situation.

I was 13 when I heard my mom tell her friend Linda that having three kids was her biggest regret. They were drinking wine on the patio. Thought I was at basketball practice. But coach canceled, so I came home early. If I could do it over, I'd stop at one, my mom said, laughing like it was funny. Maybe two. But three? That broke me. I'm the third kid. I stood behind the sliding door, basketball still under my arm, listening to my mother explained how I ruined her life. How she was finally getting her career back after my sister. Then my brother came along and set her back again. But she managed. Then I happened. Birth control failure. She called me like I was a defective product. Linda asked which kid she'd keep if she had to choose. My mom didn't even hesitate. Sophia, obviously. She's going to Yale next year. Pure genius, that one. What about the boys? Tyler. Sweet. Good at sports. Easy kid. She took another sip. But Ryan, he's just there. Doesn't excel at anything. Mediocre grades. No real talent. Sometimes I look at him and think, what's the point? What's the point of me, her son? I went to my room and didn't come out for dinner. When my dad knocked, I pretended to be asleep. But I wasn't sleeping. I was replaying every moment that suddenly made sense. Why my baby? Pictures stopped after age 2. Why? Sophia got a car for her 16th birthday. Tyler got a motorcycle for his, and I got a used bike from Craigslist. Why? They went to every one of Tyler's football games. I couldn't remember when my art show was. The next morning, I tested something. I told them I needed money for a field trip. $20. Ask your father, mom said. Without looking up from her phone. Ask your mother, dad said. From behind his newspaper. Tyler walked in. Hey, I need new cleats. How much? Mom immediately asked. Like, 80 bucks. She pulled out her wallet. Here's 100. Get good ones. I stopped asking for things after that. Two months later, report cards came out. I got straight b's. Best ever. I was so proud. Worked really hard for those grades. Left it on the kitchen counter where they'd see it. It sat there for a week, untouched. Tyler brought home a C plus in English. Mom hired him a tutor that same day. We can't let your grades slip, honey. You've got scholarships to think about. But the moment that broke me. My 14th birthday. They forgot. Not like they got the date wrong. They literally forgot I existed. That day, Sophia was visiting from college. Tyler had a game. They all went out to celebrate his winning touchdown. Posted family photos on Facebook. So proud of our kids. The caption read, I was.

My uncle told me buy old muscle cars and fix them up for cheap. There's only so many left and you'll get more car for your money than any new ride. When I was 22, I just landed my first decent job at a tech startup and got approved for a loan on a brand new luxury sedan. Everyone my age was driving German cars, showing off their success with monthly payments they could barely afford. But pulled me aside at a family barbecue. Uncle wasn't the type to talk much, but he always had some cool old car project going, so I figured he knew what he was talking about. I followed him over to his garage and watched him point at a beat up muscle car covered in a tarp. He explained that pile of rust cost me $2,000 in 1995, sold it last month for $140,000. Your fancy new car will be worth half what you pay the moment you drive it off the lot. These old beauties only go up if you know what you're doing. That conversation stuck with me for weeks, thinking about what uncle said while I was looking at all these shiny new cars at the dealership. Finally, I called them up and cancelled my loan approval. Instead of putting money down on a luxury sedan, I started hunting for old muscle cars I could actually afford to buy and fix up Within two months, I bought three rusted out classics from the late 60s. There was a Camaro that wouldn't start, a Corvette with a blown engine and a Chevelle that looked like it had been sitting in a field for decades. Parents were mortified when neighbors started complaining about the junkyard in our driveway. My friends thought I'd lost my mind. Every time we hung out, they wouldn't shut up about their new rides. They'd show off their leather seats and touch screens while roasting my cars. One friend laughed and said I'd never get any girls driving rust buckets like that, only cougars who were into vintage stuff. Another kept saying I looked like I was collecting scrap metal, not chicks brag about their heated seats and backup cameras, then joke that the only feature my cars had was breaking down. I'll admit there were moments pulling up next to their shiny Bmws that I wondered if uncle was wrong. But then I'd remember that 140,000 dollar sale and I stayed determined to prove them all wrong. For four years, I spent nights and weekends in Uncle's garage learning how to fix these things, welded engine work, paint, whatever I needed to know, started hitting up car auctions to see what stuff was actually worth. My social life pretty much ended because they all thought I was too broke to hang out with them. So while my friends were posting pics of their fancy interiors and complaining about 1,400 Monthly payments, I was covered in grease trying to get these rust buckets running. Slowly, I started recognizing patterns and what collectors wanted. The models I bought weren't just any old cars. They were the specific ones that were getting harder and harder

Um, it's. It's not. I feel like it's not up for someone. I don't. I just feel like it's not up for you to decide. I think it's up for the individual. And I think the way they. The way they express themselves through. You know, through the. The way they express themselves through their. What's called. Through their. Through their. Through their appeal, through their attire. I think that's more indicative of. Okay, then let's play it. Let's play this out. If everyone can just choose however they want. Should biological men who are born as a man be able to compete in female sports? I'm asking. Um, no, I don't believe that biological men should be in women's sports. And god bless you for saying that, cause that's a. So here's another question. Should biological men who identify as women be able to go into women's locker rooms? Can you repeat that one more time? Biological man. So he has a. And he says he's a woman. Should he be allowed to go into female locker rooms? I mean, we have. On campus, we have all. We have all gender restrooms on campus where males and females are. Yeah, I think that's a terrible idea. Right. So because this male female distinctions are critically important as how society is structured. Yeah. So we have these shared spaces, and there hasn't been any sort of issues or. I Don't think. I think the major consensus surrounding it is that people actually enjoy the. What's it called, the gender. The all gender bathrooms. About locker rooms. Do you think women would enjoy undressing next to a fully unclothed man? No, I don't think so. I don't care. So then we should prohibit that. So we agree. So. And then finally, do you think that a young 15 year old here in California, a young boy who thinks he is a girl, should he be allowed to drop his. Can you. Can you say that again from the start? 15 year old boy in California, he thinks he's transgender. Should he be allowed to go chop his parts off? No. Um, should he be allowed? I think. I think that's a conversation for him and his medical and his doctor and his family. I mean, I'm not. It's not. It's not my. It's not my job to. Should. Should 15 year olds be allowed to get tattoos? Should 15 year olds be allowed to get tattoos? I. No. So you could, but you can't get a tattoo. I mean. I mean with. I think that's. I don't think that's really that comparative. Well, they're both irreversible, right? Actually, one matters a lot more for human flourishing than the other. No, I would definitely agree that's. It's a very. What's it called? It's a very life altering process and I think it requires a lot of time and it requires a Lot of time. It shouldn't be something that should be just jumped into. Um, I just think that's something for an individual and their. Their family and their doctors to decide and not for, um, society or the state. The state. Last question. Most important question. What is a woman? Um. A woman. You know it. You know it when you see it. You know, it's like, if I look, she looks like a woman. She looks like a woman. She looks like a woman. She looks like a woman. It's the way. It's the way you express yourself. So, like, all these. It's the way you express yourself. So if you. If you. If you. Basically, womanhood is a costume. I'm not saying that. No, If you're able to wear the right stuff and just assume the identity, you can appropriate womanhood. Is that correct? No. Okay. Is Caitlyn Jenner a woman? Yes. Why? Why is she a woman? What chromosomes does Caitlyn Jenner have? Um, I mean, I think her chromosomes don't have to deal with her gender. Like, I think that's where the disagreement lies. Is that. Yeah. Again, so this is where you are playing into this narrative that gender exists. We reject that paradigm completely because gender has LED us to this place that your own personal self expression matters to your core identity. And again, that means nothing. Infinite personalities, no genders, two sexes. And we must live in reality, not In the delusions of the heads of people that want us to accommodate their fantasy. Thank you very much for your time.

Yes. When, when most of them especially. And I want to ask you what you think about the ones who were arrested or were detained while trying to go through the legal processes. The ones who came in actually, and it was a loophole. I'll admit that Joe Biden allowed for a loophole to get into the system, right, through, um, open borders. No, through, um, through asylum. So asylum was a loophole, but it still was a legal way to enter the country. And what about the illegal immigrants who were detained while going to their meetings to make sure they stayed within the legal process? They're still in violation of 8 USC 1312. If they came in using what is, what is, what is 8 USC 1312? You don't know. That's fine. It's fraudulently filling out an asylum claim, but, which these people are, but that's what the courts are gonna. 8 USC 13 0 5, which is illegal crossing the southern border, which can be enforced also upon the second entrance going on. And there's 8 USC 13 0 5. And I know, I don't mean to like make you look bad, you just don't know enough about this stuff. Like I encourage you to look at 8 thirteen 8 USC 13 0 5 8 18 thirteen, 8 a U c 13 12. How the Criminal code actually comes in particular here The Supreme Court is giving President Trump full authority to deport these illegals without without same due process as people here in America. But what about the Supreme Court decisions like a which one is it? Yes. So I know what you're talking about. Yes. I don't know the name, but it basically says that's three illegal aliens. Those are for illegal aliens that commit crimes while they are here. So if it's like an illegal this this is recognized do process rights for non citizens. I just deportation hearings. Yes. Correct. Not deported not every again, The Supreme Court has clarified that 2019 that not every single illegal here within the last two years gets a deportation hearing. They've clarified it and people are conveniently ignoring the media. Thank you for your time. Can you tell me where where I can find it and clarify it? Chat type in a chat GTP not chat GTP from the Supreme Court. Okay. Well, it'll lead you to the source say find me the Supreme Court case. I don't know the name of it 2019, 2018 decision around expedited removal within 100 miles of the border and two years of being in the country. The Supreme Court clarify they do not need the same due process. Right. So you're also saying that these other Supreme Court cases that were that reaffirmed that due process rights does apply to non citizens naturalized. Again, what the Supreme Court said is they had a distinction. They said that if an illegal alien is here and, for example, commits a DUI, they get to process on that infraction. They don't get to process necessarily on just the fact they came into the southern border illegally. there's about crimes you can't commit on the interior of the country different than ones that you commit while you come into the country. What about the people who have not committed crimes? Doesn't matter. Coming in the country, coming in the country for crime doesn't matter for longer than two weeks. That the Supreme Court will, hopefully it's not. Again, it's 18 USC 13. It's a 8 USC 1312. It makes it a felony to hurt yourself illegal United States America, not notify the government of your presence. You look it up anytime you want. 8 USC 1312. Any illegal alien that does not tell the government where they are, what they're doing and why they are here is in violation and is currently committing a felony. Thank you for your time on it. Thank you. Well, I can say one last question. No, we got a question. Thank you, everyone. Look up w.

Relating to immigration as well. Do you think, um, through this mass deportation that Trump, Donald Trump is trying to enforce, do you think it's fair that he wants to deport back all the Venezuelan people who just came back, who just came from Venezuela? And I understand the news has made this prejudice that Venezuelans are criminals, they're killers. I absolutely understand. I agree for the young one, the young girl that was killed here. But people do not realize how bad the safety and economic state is Venezuela is right now. They just re elected Nicolas Maduro. He is one of the worst presidents in Latin American history. Yeah, again, so in order for them to come, they'd have to come the right and legal way. Now, the Venezuela, and some have actually applied for asylum and were granted asylum through legal methods. That's a separate discussion. I think we're too generous in that way. Others decide to just enter through the southern border. Here's the thing, you have to return to your country of origin and then we can get our own house together. And let, let me just kind of put this differently. We can open up our arms again. Once our young people, you guys can own homes and have a life as good as your parents, we can start thinking about letting in all the other world's problems. Until then, we have an obligation to fulfill the mandate. So that you guys can have the same life and access to the American dream that your parents had. Thank you very much.

I know who you are cause of who you voted for. It's a, you voted for a man who is sexually liable. Who is, here we go. I know who you are. You. Oh, you know who I am. Oh, hold on. Donald Trump has never sexually assaulted or raped anybody. You're so from the pit of hell. You're so full of, oh, really? When did he do it? What year? And I don't know. She didn't either in court. She didn't even remember the year. Who, who made the claim? That is so harmful. Edgar Carol. Edgar Carol. That is so harmful to say that because, hold on. She doesn't remember the year that it doesn't, hold on. Edgar. Edgar Carol said rape is sexy. Was Donald Trump ever convicted of being a rapist? That's not about, that's not what we're talking about. Was Donald Trump ever convicted of being a rapist? He was held civilly liable. Ah, civilly, not criminally. Why? It doesn't matter if he's held liable? For something he did it a threshold of civil and criminals, two completely different. So you wanna say they're guilty when it's immigrants but not when it's Trump? Hold on. You think there should be harder standards for immigrants to get into the country to become felons? Immigrants, illegal immigrants are felons. I don't care. That's not my question. You just brought that up. I'm saying that you think it should be harder for someone to get into the country. Yes, to become a president. Yeah. Again, it should be very hard. You do? Wait, hold on. I did not say that. What are you talking about? You said yes. Hold on it. Hold. First of all, how dare you say it was easy for Trump to be president? He faced 700 years in federal prison and got shot on his way to the presidency. How dare you say that's easy for him to be president? That's not what we're talking about here. You just keep, you just keep bringing up things that have nothing to do with what we're talking about. You don't like cause they're facts you don't like. Let me repeat, stop means stop. Facts. Intoxication is a gray area. An unwanted kiss of two teenagers on a park bench and a young man goes in does not make him a sexual assaulter. That is my final statement. Thank you very much. None of this changes the fact. I'll go out. Thank you. I'll go out after This, none of this changes that you said that it was an unfair categorization. MAGA, all of you who support Trump, this is what you're voting for? A man who was held. Do you guys like what I said? Sexual, go away. These people are cheering for sexual assault. I literally said stop means stop. When there's intoxication, there is a gray area. And if a teenage boy goes in for an unwanted kiss with a young girl, that does not make him a sexual assaulter for the rest of his life. Can we agree on those three things? My goodness. And are we forgetting that just this past week in California, there was a Bill defending making it uh, illegal for 16 and 17 year olds to be actually legal to be, for 16 and 17 year olds to be sold into sex slavery and child trafficking. This is what State Senator Scott Wiener tweeted. Sending an 18 year old high school senior to state prison for offering his 17 year old classmate $20 to fool around isn't smart criminal justice policy. Yet that's what some people are effectively advocating in this misleading debate. And Riley, let's just go a step further that, that almost all the Democrats are gonna vote for this thing they did. It's like and, and is Gavin Newson gonna sign it? We'll see. Or is he too busy hosting a podcast? That's right.

No, We're a country of settlers, not of immigrants. Okay. That's a big distinction. Let me tell you the difference. Settlers are people that build a new country that was barren. Immigrants come to a country already built. The people who built this country, they went west to an unconquered, barren country and built a new society. Immigrants helped enrich it. They helped grow it upon that. But the foundation of America were settlers, not immigrants. That is a, that is a talking point. We have no unifying religion, no unifying race, no unifying, you know, national origin. We, but what we do share is that if you were born on the soil, you have an inherent birthright to the benefits of American citizenship. And when you. And that's a huge mistake. And that's a huge mistake. So you disagree with 200 years of president. Yes. Have you read what was discussed during the founding fathers? First and foremost, never wanted all of a sudden a pregnant woman to be able to get on, they didn't have airplanes back then, go across the ocean and all of a sudden they become a US citizen. Those who drafted the 14th amendment did. Yeah. The 14th amendment was in what year? 1866. Yeah, exactly. Way past the founding era. So you don't agree with. No, no. The 14th amendment was largely applicable to free slaves. I understand that was a Purpose. But it was, it has also been extended to those who come. Exactly. No, you're right. It has been wrongly extended. You know, the 14th amendment by the Supreme Court. Exactly. And they got it wrong, just like the, how they got row versus Wade wrong and we got that repealed. The point being is the Supreme Court can get things wrong. The idea, it's very simple. It's that if you think you can just get on a Delta Airlines flight from Paris and all of a sudden your kid becomes a US citizen, that devalues the meaning of what it is to be a citizen. Should we hold the, the children who do not choose to come here accountable for their parents actions? There are some countries that, well, if you're already a citizen, you're a citizen. We're not gonna revoke. Right. But once, if it becomes overturned, do we want to credit like second class citizens who aren't. No. Citizen of another country. Yes, they're, they're citizens of another country. Go back to your own the country. Except if they come from India, they come here and a child is born, that citizen, that child is not a citizen of India. Correct. Nor would they be a citizen of here. Then you have like. No, no, they are a citizen of India. That's not true. They're not. Yes, they are. The parents are Indian citizens. And that's how it works in India is that the citizenship goes To the parents. So that, that's the point, is that they can go back to their own country and they can go live in India. So, so the children should be deported as soon as they're born? Yes, with their parents? Absolutely. You, you don't think that we should give them, they should, we shouldn't encourage them become productive members of American society? No. No. Do you believe in the American dream? Yes, of course, for American citizens, not for every person around the planet. I agree. I agree. I think we all agree. Yes. It's, it's not our job to open up our borders to every sad story around the planet. Exactly. The adults. But the children who were, the children did not choose to cross the border. They did not choose to come here. Okay. They have been placed here. Exactly. So don't punish them by separating the mom and dad. They can all go back to their country of origin. It's very simple. But that's not the law. That's not how it's meant. Do you think that would be. No, hold on. The American society. Hold on. The, that's the interpretation of the 14th amendment. We're talking about two different things from my birthright citizenship and then we're talking about kids that are crossed when they're already born. The point being is this, and President Trump's executive order is phenomenal. It goes back to this very basic question, what does it mean to be a citizen? And We're throwing around citizenship like frisbees every day. You're a citizen, you're a citizen, you're a citizen. And it dilutes the meaning of the citizen, of what it means to be a US citizen. We need to bring it back to actually say, hey, you have to earn your citizenship. You are not given your citizenship. So, so the children who, a child doesn't, a child doesn't choose to be born between someone who comes here illegally and someone who is already a citizen. That person did not choose that. There's no account. Yes. And there's kids in Namibia that didn't, you know, choose to be born in Namibia. Exactly. Not our concern. To important thing about America is that by being here, you offer them the extension for the opposition. I disagree. I think that, I think on the surface it's a great thing about America. I think it's us having generosity being turned into compromising our values, used against us. At time generosity can turn into an over indulgence. You could become too generous where you are borrowing money that you don't have. We're doing that. We're giving citizenship where it dilutes. Yes, we are a generous nation and our virtues have become our vices. What does it dilute? What? What is a child being born or having birthright? You know what, you know what it dilutes, take away from us? It's, first of all, they pay taxes, first of all, No. 1. It dilutes a lot. What Is it dilute, can I, can I get to. It dilutes a lot. Number one, it dilutes legal immigrants that are full adults that had to apply to come here. And I agree. So we should stop illegal immigration. Well, but they're all. I said, I said legal, legal immigration. Right. Number two is that I actually want the idea of being a US citizen that you are here or born here because your parents did something to allow you to be here. Not just that you got on a non stop flight from Seoul, South Korea and you happen to fall in your water breaks and you're suddenly a US citizen. It to values the entire meaning of what it means. Everybody here has a unique story of what your parents did for allow you to live in this country. That's called a social compact. Some of you guys, your parents came here and your ancestors came here in the 1700s. Some of them came here in the early 1900s. But if all of a sudden you can gain entry and cut in line, it dilutes the sacrifices primarily of the greatest generation from World War 2 that allowed us to live here. And it is an insult to them to say that we can live in a free society. I wanna get to the next question. Thank you very much.

Um. Being gay is a behavior more than anything else. And you, I guess our evidence, and I love to hear your story, that you could stop acting on that behavior. So tell the audience more about you would identify as gay and as not. Tell us about that, that path and that journey. Cause I'm told that can never happen. Yeah, so I mean, a lot of people tell me that you are what you feel, um. You are um. Your attractions, you know, you're quote unquote born with it, you know, it just. There's just many reasons why you have same sex attraction, that that will never leave you and that that is who you will always be. Um. And I believe that lie for almost 10+ years of my life. I slept with men um. Many times, um. Watch a lot of porn, um. Dwell in a lot of sexual sin um. And just gave my body up because that's what I thought love was, um. And that's what I thought it looked like until I met Jesus, um. And he helped me to see that I was never meant to identify as a gay man, but I was always meant to be a son of his, um. And have a new identity and a new life in him. And I walked away from that lifestyle for over five plus years now. And I Have never looked back because Jesus is way better than the sexuality that I was partaking in. Praise god. Um, are you. Are you happier and more joyful that you're no longer participating in a homosexual lifestyle? Oh, 100%. Like before I met Jesus, I was filled with so much depression, anxiety, I wanted to, um, kill myself multiple days of the week. But Jesus came and healed all the brokenness inside of me. And I love being a son of his rather than identifying as a gay man.

Um, so I have a question, which is also kind of a disagreement, but I wanna build it up. Okay, so of course you just said Jesus is the most important thing for everyone out here. And so can you please explain to everyone out here what Jesus stood for? And especially the qualities of love. How to love your neighbor even if they don't agree with you. So what. What is your name again? Talis. Talis, that's a beautiful question. I'm glad you came up to ask it. But I wanna also just add something, cause you're right. Jesus fully embodied two things simultaneously. That showed his divine and his godly nature. Cause not thus, Jesus said good things. Jesus is Lord, Christ is king. And Jesus is god. On top of just being a guy with a lot of good ideas. Yeah. So John 8, if I'm drawing from memory correctly, best embodies both Christ's mercy and love, but also his commitment to truth. And sometimes in the modern gospel, we overemphasize the Grace and we underemphasize the truth. Yeah. And so we are far too willing to say, hey, Jesus loves everybody, but we don't get to the second part of the conversation. Says, Jesus doesn't want you to live in sin. So this is in John 8, it's best embodied. Right. Almost every Christian in this audience will be Able to tell you the first part of this, which is a bunch of Sadducees and Pharisees are sitting around, standing around with rocks, and they're about to stone, um, the prostitute woman. And Jesus comes up and says, let the first among you without sin cast the first stone. And everyone starts dropping the rocks. But what comes next shows that Christ is not just Grace focused, he's simultaneously truth focused. He goes up to the woman who had a career in selling herself for sex and said, sin no more. Now imagine today how much trouble you would get in if you would go up to somebody and say, stop sinning that well, you're being too judgmental. No, no, you're actually being Christlike. So Jesus stood. He was 100% Grace and truth. And that tension is very hard in a modern world because we want to overemphasize Grace, when in reality, Christ loves us too much to have us continue to live in sin. He wants us to try to elevate our actions to glorify god and all that we do. I agree 100%. Um, and so to build on my question, I really want to talk about D E I. And so with our Christian, I will agree with you. A lot of I read the Bible for myself, so I knew what that Scripture said. But my question is, how can Christian teachings on love, equity and justice inform and shape discussions on diversity, equity and Inclusion in today's society. And so to also, Jesus hung out with sinners. He did not judge, he told the truth. And so I think that a lot of people in society today, when we talk about political views that are opposition, we judge them because we think, oh, because you voted for Trump.

My mom's conservative and my dad's a Liberal. And my mom is always kind of pushing me to bring politics into my life. And I was wondering, a, should I care and if I should, why? And which parent should I lean more towards? Got it. So did you say Mom's Liberal? Mom's conservative? Oh, wow. Okay. That's, that's opposite I would have thought. Okay. So I, I see you have a shirt here that says who, whom shall I send? Here I am, right? Yes. Um, which I love. That is the Hebrew word heinani, which appears many times throughout the scriptures. Uh, when Abraham, the binding of Isaac, Moses at the burning bush, the call of Isaiah, the call of Samuel, every believer here in the audience, by the way, the most important thing is to bring Jesus into your life. Let me just make sure I say that. Most important thing. It's way more important than politics. It's the most important thing. Amen. And so I encourage every believer out here to learn what that word heinani means. It means, Lord, use me, send me. And I could tell you're probably going through a trial right now cause your parents are separate and it's not easy. So the scriptures are very clear about this. Uh, Christianity has a heavy emphasis on honoring your parents. Now, to contrast that with the prior questioner, I don't think she's doing a good job of honoring her parents cause she's accusing them of being in a cult. Yeah, even, this is for a very important, everybody, even if your parents share values and views and a worldview that you do not have, you are biblically obligated to honor them, which means to spend time with them and to love on them and to go visit them, even if they are wearing a black lives matter and in this home that we have no hate and trans lives, you still go and spend time with your parents. Because if you are incapable in this case of honouring your earthly father, you will never honour your heavenly father. And it's very clear in the Ten Commandments, and I'll get back down to the specific advice in the Ten Commandments, it is the only commandment, honor your mother and father so that you may live long in the land of which you are in. It is the only commandment that deals with a promise and your country. You will cease to have a strong country, America, if we do not have kids honoring their parents. You, everyone out there, every day, you, you should call your parents on a weekly basis. I know college exists a lot of the times to separate children from the parents. They want to try to separate you from your upbringing. Your parents aren't cool. They don't understand you. They don't share your values. The closer that you stay with your parents, even though you have disagreements.

Okay, so do you mean legislate control over women? Yeah, yeah, specifically with abortion, taking away her right to choose. Got it. Okay. So I'm sure if I ask this question, the answer will be no. But you would say, does a mother have the right to kill her child, not kill? But I, what I'm trying to raise awareness right now is that we need to abolish child neglect laws because that forces women to use their bodies even with babies. Now, I'm not saying they should be allowed to kill babies, but I'm saying they should be allowed to let nature just take its course, for example, that we're, I'm just saying we, we are saying that it's survival of the fittest. And what I'm saying is I think that the MAGA fascist, I think you all are winning because, because you at least are trying to be consistent on the life issue. But what I'm saying is we need to be as progressive consistent. That's why I've got this, this, uh, petition here to get people to see that we must abolish child neglect laws if we're gonna be consistent that it really is her body and her choice. So I, I, I, I think, uh, I think you're doing a very good job exposing the hypocrisy left. I could tell that this is, uh, a stick and I will say, um, it's very Effective and I tend to agree with where you're trying to go. What he, what he, they, them, whatever is saying is the following, which is to abolish child neglect laws is the furthest extrapolation of a pro abortion view, which is consistent, of course. No, and I don't know what you actually believe, but your satire can sometimes lead you towards truth. And you should show like what he's, what, what he, or, yeah, show the poster. What he's saying in a way is that in order for the left, he doesn't actually believe this. This is a stick. I, yeah, got it. Fine. Yeah. Um, but what, what he's doing is trying to prove a point that if you are pro choice, then therefore you should also get rid of child neglect laws because it means you actually don't care for the baby, whether it be in the womb or outside of the womb. And so we are forcing women to use their bodies. Sure. I got it. So, uh, very good. Thank you and best of luck with your petition. Thank you.

Taylor. Taylor, thank you for coming up. Can you give me two things that you don't agree with Trump on? Or would you like me to try to win you over for Trump? So you're not gonna be able to do that, but I appreciate it. Well, then you're not open minded. Um, so. Well, first of all, if you say that there's nothing you can then here to win be won over for Trump, then you gotta give me a good reason, at least two, why you don't like Trump. He's racist. Oh my god. Yep. Boomy. Use Google example. Thank you guys. Okay, so let me ask you a dumb question. Uh huh. Can you. Can you define what does it mean to be racist? Haha. Do you. Do you want me to look up a definition? I want you to. You. You said he's a racist, so yeah, you must. You must have a definition of racism in your mind. Tell me what that definition is. Okay, so. Oh, I'm gonna make. Make you guys wait on this. Oh, zero knowledge. Guys, please don't heckle. Just. I'm. I'm. I want to try to understand because these words have a lot of meaning. Yeah, but you can't get. I know it's hard on the spot. I just want you to think about it. Because if you say Trump is a racist, you should be able to easily give a definition of what that Word means. So it's hatred towards another race. Right. So when has he ever exhibited that? Give me clear and specific examples. You got one? Um. Well, yeah, I heard someone say he told a. Told. Yes. Okay, but let me just help you out here. Uh huh. What? You think he's a racist cause the media has told you he's a racist? Because you can't give me an example off the top of your head. And even when you phone a friend of the audience, not. I'm not criticizing you. Maybe the media is lying to you. Maybe the man who's being called a racist is actually someone that's trying to improve lives of all Americans. I think this is fun, guys. So. Okay, so let me just ask one. One final question for you. Yeah. Um. Which is you. You say you are Liberal. Yeah. Right. And you say you lean to the left. Yeah. Are. Are you open minded to have your mind changed on your core. On your core political principles? On my core political principles or philosophical? If it's a fact, then sure. Cool. So can I give you a fact? I want you to think about Kamala Harris as she's been in charge of the border. We have 320,000 missing children right now in this country that were all sex traffic or labor traffic across the southern border. Do you agree that that should probably get more attention? I think any type of issue Like that should get attention. Have you heard about that before? Me mentioning it? Not really. Like I said, I don't really know that much. No, I know. No, but hold on. But you had. You knew enough to say Trump was a racist. Why do you think you don't know that? There's 320,000 missing kids in America? Why is that? It's not really presented in the media. The media is so focused right now on the battle between conservative and Liberal. But isn't that a core part of the battle? That the Liberal vice president has allowed 320,000 kids to go missing? So how is she allowed that, exactly? That's a good question. She's in charge of the border. She has stopped DNA testing at the border. So if a kid comes to the border, 12 years old, and someone says, I'm their father, there's no DNA rapid test. That takes 90 seconds to make sure that's actually the father. Most times it's a pimp that is selling the girl into sex slavery. In the interior of the United States. Kamala Harris specifically got rid of that policy. So it was in place before? Yes. When Donald Trump was president. It required DNA testing, and families would remain together, and they were not granted asylum into the interior of the country. And we had remained in Mexico. The lowest border crossings in American history. Under Kamala Harris, we have 10 million people coming illegally into America. Okay, next person. All right, I want you to think about these things. And maybe one day you'll remember this conversation. And you'll think back that maybe conservatives have been right all along. Thank you.

Sure. Fair, very fair question. Thank you. And thank you for having the, um, position that border security is, is important cause not everyone in the Democrat Party does. Why don't you outline some of the, like 1 or 2 costs, I would imagine economic or maybe cultural? Let's line, lay out two of the most pressing costs that you would see in your, in your research. So from, from my point of view, I, I see that it will likely decrease jobs for Americans. I think you look at the, um, Secure Communities Initiative under Barack Obama and the effects of that. Um, the studies of that show that for every 1 million, um, unauthorized workers that are deported, that's 88,000 American citizens who are forced into unemployment. Um, the other cost is, is the opportunity costs. Obviously, one of the, the biggest points is to keep people safe. But if we're spending $1 trillion to deport unauthorized workers, there are better ways to spend that money to keep people safe, such as investing in police departments, paying higher salaries, better training, things like that. So there's a third element, which is also fairness. So those of us that are conservatives that support mass deportations think that it's wrong that you can cut in line to come into the United States of America when someone else has to wait 10 or 20 years to be able to come here legally. So it's An issue of fairness. But would you agree that we are headed towards an inevitable massive job displacement problem with artificial intelligence and robotics? Would you agree that that's probably on the near event horizon of 10 to 20 years? Yes. Tech, tech will take, take some jobs away for sure.

She didn't want her classmates to find out that her mother was blind. However, despite this, the mother still managed to recognize her by her scent. When they got home, the girl got into an argument with her mother. Just then, the mobile phone in her pocket rang. The mother, thinking her daughter was misbehaving, angrily threw the phone to the ground when she saw that it was broken. The daughter ran to her mother's room, destroyed the cassette tapes her mother treasured more than anything, and stormed out of the house. The parents waited until nightfall, but the daughter didn't come back. The next day, they heard on the recorder that the police had found a female body on the beach. They immediately went to the police station to identify it. The mother touched the body's arm and didn't find any scars, confirming that it wasn't her daughter. They went out on the streets searching from day until night, but they couldn't find her. However, at that moment, the girl was strolling with her boyfriend, unaware of how worried her parents were. When she finally came home, she discovered her parents weren't there. Seeing the broken cassette tapes on the floor, she realized what had happened.

But the pain he felt wasn't his. It belonged to a woman. Turns out they shared the ability to feel sensations. Meaning the pain was mutual. 20 years ago, when Marco was in elementary school, he suddenly felt his heart race, his body trembling, and nerves on edge. The others around him were confused. But Marco saw a ski slope and a girl out of control in a loud crash. Marco passed out in the classroom while the girl fell in the snow. That was their first sensory link, though no one noticed at the time. As the years passed, Marco went from teenager to a mature man. One day, while driving, he saw the same scene again at the same time, thousands of miles away. Kelly also noticed her vision blur. What the hell? Marco slammed on the brakes. After all these years, that strange voice in his mind was clearer than ever. He was sure it wasn't just some hallucination. Once they both calmed down, they realized they were sharing the same vision. The oddest part. Even though they were 1,000 miles apart, with a two hour time difference. They could hear each other and experience each other's sight. Two complete strangers inexplicably connected.

Through a private investigator's research, I got the basic info on 4 criminals. The first one loved working out. He drank a ton of protein powder every day while eating an apple. I suddenly thought of the perfect plan. Then I started cutting apples again, took out the seeds and ground them into powder because apple seeds contain cyanide. Just 1.5 grams is enough to kill a person. Then I sneaked into the criminal's house and poured the seed powder into the protein powder he planned to drink. When he took it the next day, he instantly started convulsing and foaming at the mouth. Luckily, his brother was home and rushed him to the hospital. In time, they saved his life, but he ended up permanently disabled. The second criminal was a pervert. So I hired two women to lure him into a car, then knocked him out. When he woke up again, he just wanted to pee to relax. But when he looked down, he saw his precious part was gone, freaked out and fell onto a pipe and died on the spot. Meanwhile, the police investigation came out. His home was filled with pieces of apples and his computer search history showed how to make cyanide. He was conveniently arrested and sentenced to life for murder. And He was the third criminal who assaulted my daughter. Then I went to the hospital and told the paralyzed man everything I had done. I said this was revenge and all four of them would pay.

It eased her arm pain for a moment, but it greatly slowed her efficiency. My mother's tens of thousands of daily motions. I had already left her with serious work related injuries. So for the next 10 years, I never stopped observing and thinking of ways to ease her burden. Until one day my bicycle chain suddenly fell off. When I struggled to put the rusty chain back and gently push the pedal, spinning wheel gave me an idea. After days of non stop experimenting, I used two wheels and a few old boards to build the first prototype of a loom. When two friends came to the warehouse to see it, they thought it was silly and ridiculous. Neighbors laughed at me. Even my parents told me to do something proper, like finding a good girl to marry so she could inherit the weaving skill and help my mother with the work. A sweet marriage did make me pause the research. But only six months after the wedding, my wife's arm hurts so badly she couldn't lift it. Seeing something was wrong with her broke my heart. I knew letting her rest was only temporary, so I reignited my drive to build the machine. After learning how the machine worked, my wife realized I was right to stay determined. So she chose to fully support my work. But I told her I had No money to continue the sake of my dream, she gave me her lifelong savings of 1,000 rupees. Without hesitation. From that moment I devoted myself fully to the research. This time I kept quiet and told no one. Months later, the simple loom was finally done. I invited family and friends with full confidence.

Little did she know, this act would make her regret it for the rest of her life. Just as the woman poured food into the man's bag, countless black vines suddenly emerged from inside. By the time Anna realized something was wrong, it was too late. The vines instantly crawled all over her body. Then, under the man's control, Anna was suspended in midair. Seeing this, the man decided to stop pretending. He took off his tattered clothes and removed the Mark from his forehead. His arms became more muscular, and even his messy long hair transformed into a stylish short cut. It turned out he was the legendary Demon King Jack. Just then, a swarm of bats appeared in the sky. A giant bat landed beside Jack, and Jack was its master. Anna was placed on the bat's back while he sat in the pilot's position, preparing for takeoff. The giant bat then leaped from the cliff's edge, flapping its enormous wings and ascending rapidly. Just when Jack thought it was all over, a giant eagle suddenly charged at him. Jack quickly dodged the Eagle's attack by swerving to the side. He originally wanted to shake off the Eagle, but Jack had underestimated its speed, so he decided to use superior piloting skills to lose it.

His mother died during childbirth and his father abandoned him at the door of a nursing home. A caregiver named Queenie found him and moved by compassion, decided to adopt him, naming him Benjamin. Seven years passed and Benjamin grew older in appearance, living a monotonous life just like the other residents of the nursing home. But deep inside, he remained a child, immature and full of wonder. One day, encouraged by the local priest, Benjamin mustered all his strength and stood up. It was the first time he had freed himself from the wheelchair, taking his first steps towards learning how to walk. By the time he turned 11, he met someone who would change his life forever, Daisy. She saw something different in Benjamin. His unique vitality stirred a sense of curiosity in her. But just as things began to change, Daisy's grandmother appeared and sent her back to her room. As she left, the grandmother insulted Benjamin. Though only 12, Benjamin had endured more bitterness than most people could imagine, all because of his aging appearance. Needing to clear his mind, he went down to the docks where a captain was recruiting sailor.

Not only did he play music for her baby, but when he found out she was a single mom, he even offered to help prepare formula. After the flight, however, Mike threw out a wild idea. He told her he wanted her to be his contract wife. He was tired of the marriage his parents had arranged for him and had no interest in marrying someone he didn't love. Daisy, meanwhile, was worried about how to explain the arrival of her baby to her dad. Just as she was hesitating, her child called him dad, and that simple act saved her from years of inner turmoil. Seeing her baby accept him so easily, Daisy had no choice but to go along with it. What she didn't expect, though, was just how ridiculously wealthy Mike's family was. Their house looked like a castle. As soon as they stepped inside, Mike was taken aback. His parents had thrown a massive welcome party and a stunning fiance rushed up to kiss him. But when Daisy walked in, everyone froze, scrambling to change the baby's diaper. Daisy, however, didn't care about formality. She placed the baby on the table like it was her own home, asked Mike's dad to distract the child with his phone, and even handed the soil diaper to Mike's mom without noticing the shocked stares around her. She handled it all like a pro. And after taking the diaper back, she headed to the bathroom. It wasn't until she left that everyone snapped out of it. Mike's mom immediately turned to him and asked, who is this woman?

In an instant, she grabbed his throat and slammed him against the wall. Thomas managed to calm her down and the lights flickered on. The woman stared at the TV, then suddenly drove a trident into the screen. A sharp pain shot through her body as the wound flared up and she collapsed, clutching her side. When she woke up again, her wound was carefully bandaged. She scanned the room, her gaze landing on a small fish swimming in a tank. Without hesitation, she grabbed it and swallowed it whole. I was going to make you some eggs. Just don't eat my dog again, Thomas said, handing her a cup of hot tea. She took the cup, watching him blow on his tea before she took a sip. So, uh, who are you? Thomas asked. Atlanta, Queen of Atlantis, he replied. Atlanta reached out, catching a falling snowflake in her hand. Thomas draped a blanket over her and they shared a quiet, tender moment. They soon fell deeply in love, and Atlanta gave birth to their son. She used a teddy bear and a fork to tell him stories about the underwater kingdom of Atlantis. Suddenly, a bomb exploded, shattering the wall, and Atlantic soldiers stormed into the room.

It could reduce an ordinary human to just 10 cm tall. They ate less, lived in smaller spaces, and over four years produced as much waste as a single day for a normal sized person. Best part, they could live like millionaires. Luxury homes cost just $99 and pearl necklaces went for five. A poor husband and wife visited the miniature city and eventually chose to undergo the shrinking procedure. Before being miniaturized, they had to shave all their hair and have every tooth pulled because teeth cannot shrink. Then they were pushed into the enormous oven. When the procedure ended, a nurse with a small cart carefully moved them onto tiny beds. When they woke, the doctor was already there.

Just don't. Don't let it get to you. Please continue. Okay, cause it's just disrespectful. But, um. So. So I had people telling me about the Democratic Party, like, different stuff. They were like, this is good because of this. And then I had my family, they're like, well, Trump's good because of this. So then I just started researching literally three days ago, and I fell down this whole like, rabbit hole of so much stuff. Um, and um, that's why I will be voting for the Democratic Party. Can I ask You. It's not your question. What did you find persuasive enough to convince you to vote for Democrats? Well, so you talked about Trump creating safe cities, safe streets, just a safe country. But you know about his rally where he said that he wants one full day of police retaliation to eradicate crime? You know about that? Are you familiar with the night of broken glass? Crystal knocked? World War 2. Are you familiar with that? I'm intimately familiar. I'm trying to understand the connection. Are we doing the Nazi thing again, or, like. Are we, like. There's honestly. So. So crime was lower under Trump than under Kamala and Joe Biden. So I'm not. Okay, like, much lower. Violent crime was substantially and sizably lower in every major metro area and every.

It was a miniature pistol, a hidden weapon specially designed for assassins. On the overpass, the two engaged in an intense battle. Lisa moved quickly, agile and precise. But no matter how she attacked, she couldn't break through his defense. Time passed bit by bit, yet the situation remained unchanged. Her stamina was slowly drained and the rhythm of the fight began slipping from her control. Refusing to accept defeat, Lisa grabbed a stun baton and smashed it hard against the man's body. To her shock, even as the electric current intensified, he didn't let go. Seconds later, he countered with a reverse strike, knocking Lisa to the ground. The man slowly drew his pistol, his hand trembling slightly, aiming at Lisa's head. Just as he was about to pull the trigger, a toothpick suddenly shot into his arm. Reinforcements had arrived. The man leapt onto the assassin's shoulder. Their fighting styles were completely different. Lisa was like the wind, fast and agile. He was like a mountain, steady and unyielding. No matter how the assassin countered, he always found an opening and quickly retaliated. Within a few moves, the assassin was subdued before Lisa could even speak. To stop him, the man turned and left, clean and efficient, like the wind, as if he had never appeared at all.

Thirty five years later, he awoke in the middle of a rice field in a remote village somewhere in rural China. Strangers surrounded him and the language they spoke was completely unfamiliar. The boy, terrified, fainted on the spot. The villagers quickly contacted the US Embassy. When the staff checked his clothes, they discovered a tag with a handwritten name, Jacob. Astonishingly, the boy could recall his entire family address from memory. Soon after, he was sent back to the United States, delivered to the house he had written down. Detective Malik assigned to follow the case. Unable to believe the address actually existed, he knocked and a man in his 70s opened the door. Malik asked if the man had ever lost a son. The elder informed him that his child had died 35 years ago. But when he saw the boy, he froze. Jacob suddenly blurted out a nonsensical phrase rushed out at the speed of lightning like millions of miles per hour, like frogs spinning in a blender. The old man responded instinctively to the riddle. Seconds later, he realized that only he and his son had ever known this puzzle. Yet 35 years ago, he had buried his son with his own hands.

Then with one confident stroke of a pen, he rewrote the date, adding 10 extra years to his life on paper. He trimmed the ruined receipt, lifted its name cleanly and pressed it carefully over the real one as if patching a new identity into place. Next came the step that mattered most. He pulled out a plane model he had soaked in water beforehand, peeled off the airline's tiny emblem and fixed it onto the corner of the receipt. Just like that, the counterfeit airline check was ready when he walked into the bank to cash it. The teller almost spotted the trick, almost, but his charm worked faster than her suspicion. Few gentle words, a smile and the check went through without a hitch. Success tasted good, too good. He bought more model airplanes, crafted more forge checks and even faked pilot credentials, turning paper into cash again and again. Each win made him bolder. Soon he was flying for free, slipping straight into cockpits as if he belonged among the crew. From then on, he traveled exclusively on that airline, cashing forged checks all across the country. One day while cashing another one, he struck up a conversation with a bank employee and quietly coaxed out details about their newest anti forgery measures. He headed straight to an auction afterward, purchased a professional grade printing machine and His operation, his entire scale expanded overnight.

If you truly believe that the vast majority of people were educated enough about the fact of Donald Trump's opinion, voters aren't very smart. Now that's what we're going after. No, I'm simply just responding to what you said. What you said. Insult the voters, they don't know. No, no, a lot. I know a lot of people that voted for Trump who had absolutely no idea that he was gonna defund the. And of course, this is just an anecdote, but I know that. That this is the truth. Not everybody look when they vote, looks at every single little thing and every little aspect, like you and I might of why we would vote for somebody like, we're both political commentators, right? So the fine and. And as a political commentator, then I will. I will argue more forcefully against you, cause now you're not just like a college kid searching for this. Has education America improved or gotten worse since the Department education was formed? It is literally been three months. I have absolutely no idea. Since the Department Education was formed in the 70s, we. We now have 50 years of evidence. Has American education gotten better since we've had a department of education or has it gotten worse? I personally don't think that that has to do with department of education. I. Well. Well, when you spend. When you've spent over four and a half trillion dollars with one Federal department. And we have 30 schools in Chicago where a 5th grader cannot read at grade level. We have 35 schools in Baltimore where kids cannot do math or reading at grade level. We have, cannot find a single school, not a single school in, in downtown Detroit where by the time they graduate high school in the heavily black areas, that they're proficient in reading or math.

Oh, is it? Well, hold on. Let's think about that. Sure. Was a, was a, first of all, it's legal, not illegal. But was America founded by immigrants or settlers? Settlers. That's not an immigrant. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And that's not my point. My point is that you just brought up the, the nation built by immigrants. Yeah. We're actually not because the political leaders have said that this place is built. Yeah. And they're, they're wrong. Immigrants, they're wrong. Political leaders are wrong. George Bush is wrong. All these political leaders who have built America. By the way, the first person to say that was. How is that wrong? When illegal immigrants make. I just. They grow the economy. OK. Statistically. Allow me, studies again. Allow me to build it out for you. Sure, immigrants have helped at times in American history, but we are first and foremost a nation founded by settlers. Immigrants come to a country already built. Settlers come to a barren place and build something new. Right? This land was barren when people came in the 1840s gold rush. This was not an easy place to live. Yeah. California was not exactly industrialized. There was not immigrants coming west to California. Those were settlers building a new place around, you know, western, western values. Finally, I would just ask the question, do you see a moral distinction between a legal immigrant And an illegal immigrant. Well, the argument is that they're cutting in line the argument is that they're cutting in line in the 20 year process that it would take for someone to be to it's not it's not 20 at most it's 20 at most it's 20 right now there's around like 1.2 million people who are currently waiting that would take six to seven years for a hearing. And by the way, no one has a right to come to this country, just to be clear. Let me stay on track of what I was gonna say. Okay. So so people people who come here usually almost all the time when they come here, it's it's they benefit society. They benefit society. There's studies that have done this.

But the moment she stepped into the hotel, she turned back into the obedient assistant who always followed her boss's orders. The director handed her a manual and told her to learn the prices of all the artworks before he returned. Anna didn't dare slack off for a second. She immediately headed to the company's London branch, dragging her heavy suitcase through the busy streets. Luckily, she made it to the meeting just in time. During the meeting, the executives announced a major collaboration to help a wealthy client auction off her private art collection. What Anna didn't know was that the mysterious client was William's mother. After the meeting, two co workers deliberately made things difficult for her. Because the office space was limited, they LED Anna to work in the basement, so this is my office? Yeah, let me guess. My hotel. It's a shithole. She didn't complain, knowing that earning the director's approval was the only way to advance her career. Then out of the blue, she received a message, an invitation from William's mother to a party. After work, Anna returned to the small, simple apartment her coworkers had arranged for her. She slipped into an elegant dress and headed out to the party.

And I knew that if I worked really hard, someday she wouldn't have to anymore. I ranked No. 1 at the Future Stars Nationals last year. I was going to the Rio Olympics. I was next. When my hip started to hurt, I thought that I pulled a muscle, so I trained through it. I'm not next anymore. I'm nothing. I'm number zero. Hey, no, you're not.

He had just wanted to send his sister to the hospital as soon as possible, but what he saw before him left him completely stunned. He didn't even dare to get out of the car to pick up his sister's head. After standing there in a daze for a few minutes, he finally started the car slowly and left. From that moment on, all the strange things seemed to have just begun. After getting home, Jack stayed in bed all night, his eyes vacant, trying to escape from reality. Early in the morning, when Lisa, the mother, was about to go out, she found that her daughter's head had vanished from the car. She was immediately heartbroken and plunged into endless pain and despair. To relieve her grief, she joined a mutual aid society and confided her painful feelings to others. But the grief still couldn't be let go. She even moved into the treehouse that her daughter loved most before her death. And the atmosphere at home came even more eerie. Jack, the son, couldn't sleep at night and was in a daze. The only relatively normal father, John, could only silently recall in his daughter's room. Finally, one day at dinner, the pent up emotions erupted completely. If you could have just said I'm sorry or faced up to what happened, maybe, Pam, we could do something with this. But you can't take responsibility for anything. So now I. Can't accept and I can't forgive because, because nobody admits anything they've done. The next day, Lisa went to the mutual aid meeting again, but was told by a woman that she could summon her daughter's soul through a ritual. That night, Lisa called John and Jack to the living room, took out her daughter's favorite drawing book in her lifetime and began to chant incantations. Unexpectedly, as soon as I finished reading, the red candle on the table instantly burst into flames. Why are you scaring me? Make it stop. Make it fucking stop. Make it stop. Stop it. Stop it now.

Sacó lentamente la Mina del lápiz hasta que se rompió. En realidad solo quería confirmar si estaba dormido. Cuando se aseguró de que estaba dormido, salió de la habitación, abrí los ojos y lo seguí en silencio. Para mi sorpresa, vi que mi hermano, a quien siempre había considerado enfermo y cojo, caminaba perfectamente normal. Lo seguí hasta un callejón oscuro y descubrí que en realidad era el líder de una banda criminal. Seguí siguiéndolo, tratando de entender qué estaba pasando, pero de repente alguien me golpeó por detrás y me dejó inconsciente. Cuando desperté estaba sentado en la misma mesa de la noche anterior. Confundido. Miré a mi alrededor y vi a mi hermano, que acababa de despertar y se comportaba como si nada hubiera pasado. Corrí nervioso y me encerré en el baño. Mi hermano trató de calmarme y me dijo que solo había visto mal porque había olvidado tomar la medicación. Después de mucho explicarme realmente, comencé a creer que todo había sido una pesadilla y me disculpé con él, pero cuando mi hermano se fue, de repente noté la Mina de lápiz sobre la mesa y horrorizado me di cuenta que mi hermano no era en absoluto quien decía ser. Corrí inmediatamente a contarle a mi madre. Ella se sorprendió mucho y dijo que definitivamente lo descubriría todo. Pero por la noche ocurrió algo aún más extraño.

I lowered my hand, understanding everything. At lunchtime, classmates ate delicious fried chicken. I dare not even look, but a classmate noticed me anyway. What's wrong? Can't you even afford a piece of bread? He tossed the chicken skin onto the floor. I fought back my rage, remembering my mother's words to promise me you won't fight. But the humiliation didn't stop. Don't you change his name from poor man to poor man. It's Foreman. What's that? Poor man. I couldn't take it anymore and stood up. He still didn't back down. I was completely enraged.

Pointing me in a new direction. I told my mother my decision. She warned me not to fight anymore. But on my first day of school, I nearly got into a fight over a bed. I held back my anger, open my suitcase and found a note from my mother and a pair of new shoes. She wanted me to leave the past behind and embrace a new life. The next day, the shoes vanished. As I searched frantically, I spotted them. On someone else's feet. I stared at him and he turned and ran. I gave chase. He hid in a dorm room. I kicked the door open, pinned him against the window and tried to grab the shoes back. Just then, the supervisor burst in and stopped me. I let him go, but the administrator misunderstood and tried to send me to prison. That boy stole my shoes. My mama worked hard to give me those. He shoved me into a car, intending to take me away. I begged desperately, saying I'd do anything to stay. The administrator decided to give me one last chance and took me to a boxing gym. But I couldn't land a single punch. My movements were clumsy and I was knocked down by others. People laughed the same mocking laughter from my childhood. I rose and slammed my fist into the punching bag. That single punch stunned everyone. Seeing this, the manager encouraged me to learn boxing. I decided to give it a shot. After two months of training, I stepped back into the ring. This time I easily defeated the opponent.

Jack swore to take back what was rightfully his. With the substantial funding provided by the old Chairman, Jack's influence gradually expanded and a power struggle was about to erupt. Soon after, the old chairman suddenly died, Jack knew the Chairman's death was definitely John's doing. Clearly, he had discovered that the chairman had been supporting Jack. At that moment, Jack mentally sentenced John to death. What he didn't know, however, was that if John could kill even the old chairman, he certainly wouldn't spare Jack. After the funeral, Jack and John left together. But up ahead, a group of men had set up an ambush on the road. This film is called friend.

Now she can go find her own damn liver. No cuts. So your answer is no? My answer is hell, no. Right. Granny's gonna get a liver today. Didn't see that coming. You didn't? I've been treating her for five years. I didn't think she could say the word screw. Such a good baker. She's an organ hog. I'm so sorry. She could just be cranky from not eating before the surgery. Don't apologize. It is absolutely her right to say no. She's so unlike Mama. She volunteered for meals on wheels. She. I'm just surprised. And that poor girl, she Get another chance? There's no guarantee. But, Lily, that is why we have a U know list. So that people can wait their turn and get a chance fair and square. And that's what Granny June has done.

I just couldn't control my desire. After satisfying him, I started thinking about what happened these past few days. That day, the wind was blowing hard on the street. We bumped into each other and fell to the ground. He helped me pick up the things I dropped. Then he looked at my injured knee and invited me to his home. He said his place was just upstairs. I didn't think much of it and went with him, simply treated my wound. While I was on the phone telling my husband I'd be home late, the boy was drawn to the way I crossed my legs. He grabbed an ice pack and placed it on my leg. After the call, I was ready to leave, but he found excuses to make me stay. He told me there was an important book on the shelf. Out of curiosity, I opened it. The words inside made me feel uneasy. Instinctively, I made up an excuse and left. But when I got home, I realized I had accidentally brought the book with me. I told my husband about it. He said I should thank that man. The next morning, after sending my son to school, I picked up that book again. A card slipped out from inside. It had his contact number on it. I dialed the number. He invited me. Over to his house. Nervously I went to his place. You got, do I want to take off something? I can't stay very long. My parents have to run. When he went to make coffee, I noticed a book on the table. He told me it was a book for the blind. Then he asked me to close my eyes and gently placed my hand on the page. As he guided my fingers across the Braille, he read the words out loud. At that moment, I felt something I'd never felt before. Soon, our hands were holding each other's. Not wanting to betray my husband, I found an excuse to leave. Then I went to my husband's office. He was surprised to see me there. We hugged each other tightly. I bought him some new clothes. He couldn't wait to put them on. When we got home, I used my bad mood to test him. But instead of comforting me, he just turned around and left the room. When I looked up, I realised I was alone. My mind went back to the moment I met the boy that afternoon. The next day, I went to see him again. I brought him some desserts. He naturally helped me take off my coat. Then we started dancing together in the room. How many girlfriends have you had? Two. Really? Would I like to know? I don't know. Would you? But a sudden knock on the door interrupted us. That's when I. Suddenly realized, I think this is a mistake. There's no such thing as a mistake. That's what you do and what you don't do. I can't do this. I quickly grabbed my bag and walked out. He kicked the dessert helplessly. I forgot my coat. That night when I got home, my husband noticed something had changed about me. Latter Khan. Yeah. Do you love me? Of course I love you. What a silly question. I'm just, I'm feeling. So when I was out eating with my friend, I ran into that boy again by accident. Our eyes met for a moment when he walked past us. His charm caught my friend's attention, so I made up an excuse and left the table.

Then he walked over, lifted his new stepmother, Alice, into his arms, and kissed her. To his surprise, Alice seemed to enjoy the moment, too. Their gestures grew bolder and more intimate. And just as Alice was about to lose control and let Hugo go further, his father, Jonas, woke up. The two of them quickly pulled away and acted as if nothing had happened. Poor Jonas had no idea what had just unfolded. He simply suggested taking Alice back to their bedroom to rest, watching them walk into the room together. Hugo was consumed with jealousy because he was Alice's real boyfriend, not his father. Later that night, the sounds coming from his father's bedroom drove Hugo to the edge. He couldn't bear to accept what was happening. Half an hour passed, and Alice seemed to sense Hugo's distress. She sent him a text to comfort him, promising she'd sneak over to his room in the middle of the night. Finally, after Jonas fell asleep, Alice quietly got out of bed and headed for Hugo's room. Just as she reached the doorway, Jonas woke up and noticed her strange behavior. Alice had no choice but to lie. She said she was just passing by and wanted to close Hugo's door for him. Jonas believed her. This turn of events crushed Hugo, who'd been eagerly waiting for her. Overcome with anger, He decided to get back at Alice by going after her daughter Julie. That night, when Julie came to visit Alice, Hugo deliberately walked out in front of her without a shirt on. Julie was instantly drawn to her mother's stepson. She thought he was incredibly handsome. Seeing she was hooked, Hugo went a step further. He kissed Julie on the cheek as a greeting, making sure Alice saw it. Sure enough, Hugo's actions made Alice suspicious. She stared at him angrily, but Hugo completely ignored her glare. He took Julie by the hand and LED her straight into his bedroom.

Mis padres escribían de vuelta en la pizarra, pero cada vez tenía que esperar una semana entera para ver su respuesta tan lenta que me hacía sufrir.

De esta manera, se convirtió en un asesino. Iba a asistir a una reunión que solo invitaba asesinos. Pronto, Ben llegó al lugar acordado. Una mujer rubia vino a recogerlo. Ella lo llevó a una villa lujosa, rodeada de autos de alta gama. Antes de entrar, tenía que pasar un escaneo de huella dactilar. Aquí fue donde su huella falsificada le fue útil, pero falló en los 2/1 intentos. La mujer empezó a sospechar. Él miró nervioso su pulgar en el tercer intento. El escaneo finalmente funcionó. Ben conoció al dueño de la villa. Para su sorpresa. El dueño era solo un fanático coleccionista de asesinos en serie y organizaba este tipo de reuniones cada año. El dueño le mostró su colección. Un disfraz de payaso llamó su atención, despertando fragmentos de recuerdos. Luego había un refrigerador usado por un caníbal y un martillo cubierto de sangre. Estas eran las mismas herramientas que él había usado en crímenes pasados. A cambio, Ben también entregó una tarjeta de presentación. Poco después, otros asesinos llegaron 1 a 1, comenzó la cena, pero un asesino estaba ausente. Había roto las reglas y el dueño lo ejecutó en el acto. Después de la comida, un asesino presentó su siguiente objetivo, una mujer que quería tatuarse a su perro fallecido. Como tributo, el asesino planeaba matarla primero y luego convertir su tatuaje en un objeto de colección. Esas palabras crueles alteraron los Nervios de Ben. Cuando la reunión terminó, los asesinos se fueron 1x1. Al día siguiente, Ben concertó una cita con ese asesino. Casualmente, la mujer con el tatuaje estaba sentada justo frente a ellos. El asesino le mostró sus herramientas a Ben. Ben puso una excusa para irse. En realidad, estaba esperando cerca. Cuando el asesino se preparó para atacar, Ben aprovechó la oportunidad para emboscarlo. Ató al asesino con plástico transparente, Ben tomó un poco de sangre como recuerdo y luego levantó su cuchillo.

I'm gay. Life was good. I moved to Florida, got two adorable pups and a boyfriend named Jimmy. I swear, I bought anything that caught my eye. Clothes, jewelry. You name it, I snatched it up. I was the guy everyone called to find out where the new hot spots were. Clubs, bars, restaurants. I knew them all. And sometimes I'd even stay at hotels on the weekend just because I heard they had great bathrooms or room service or really hot bellboys. But it didn't take me long to realize something that never occurred to me before. Actually, no one ever really talks about this, but. Cash or charge? Being gay is really expensive. Charge. Now, I had a job, but it was nowhere near good enough for living as high on the gay hog as I wanted to us one, right? Finest in the land. And for a guy without a college education, my options were limited. So I had no choice. Come, ma'am. You're checked. Yep. Insurance fraud, credit card fraud, passport fraud. I was selling bad tomatoes. Anything to make a buck. And best of all, there you go. No one got hurt. Mr. Evans, um, can I see some ID, please? Of course you can.

Un grupo de hombres enmascarados con armas salió y caminó directo hacia la niña. Ella notó que algo no estaba bien, abrió la puerta e intentó correr, pero los pandilleros la alcanzaron rápido. Solo pudo gritar pidiendo ayuda hasta que un puñetazo la dejó en silencio. Entonces otro de los tipos se acercó lentamente. Su papá todavía estaba dentro del restaurante sin saber nada de lo que pasaba afuera, hasta que uno de los pandilleros levantó un arma. Fue en ese momento cuando se dio cuenta de que algo andaba mal y salió corriendo. Los demás se subieron a los autos para huir, pero el que disparó se quedó paralizado. Claramente era su primera vez. Justo entonces el padre lo tumbó de un golpe y le arrancó la máscara. Los 2 comenzaron a pelear al escuchar las sirenas. Los demás no tuvieron opción y se fueron sin él. Durante el forcejeo, el tipo le dio una patada a william, se soltó y trató de huir, pero terminó chocando directo con la policía. Fue arrestado de inmediato. William abrazó a su hija cubierta de sangre, destrozado. Cuando su esposa llegó al hospital. La niña ya había muerto, una familia feliz se había roto en pedazos y todo esto solo pasó porque el jefe de la Banda dani estaba poniendo a prueba a un nuevo recluta. Para entrar al grupo tenía que salir a la calle y matar a alguien al azar, ya fuera que escapara o terminara en prisión. Eso lo hacía parte de la pandilla y esta vez la hija de william, que fue la víctima. Su muerte dejó a la familia completamente destruida. Pero la pesadilla no terminó ahí. El fiscal le dijo a william que el sospechoso solo admitió haber resistido el arresto y agredido a un oficial. Negó todo lo demás. No había cámaras ni testigos, así que no se podía probar que fue el asesino. Lo máximo que recibiría serían de 3 a 5 años. William quedó atónito. El hombre que mató a su hija apenas sería castigado. No podía aceptar eso. Así que al día siguiente, en la corte, william tomó una decisión que dejó a todos en retiró todos los cargos. El sospechoso fue liberado de inmediato. Dani incluso fue a recogerlo personalmente. Salieron del tribunal riendo y celebrando. Sin saber que william los seguía. Los persiguió en silencio y cuando vio al tipo solo, pisó el acelerador y lo atropelló para un padre que perdió a su hija. Esto apenas comenzaba. You're that girl's pops. You killed my little girl. She was innocent

But just then, a big guy walked over. Is your watermelon sweet? Of course. Uh, try it yourself. Clearly, he noticed something was off, but that was exactly what I wanted. Then I used the moment to sneak some vegetables into my jacket. While the two of them were arguing, I started stealing fruits again. Soon, Tony caught a whiff of the paint on the watermelon. He never would have guessed that the one who painted it was actually me. But right then, Tony accidentally found a piece of evidence. He followed the trail of grapes on the floor and saw me hiding in the distance. What he didn't know was I was stealing all this just to feed my kid some fruits. After explaining everything, I took out all the things I had just stolen. But just when I was about to surprise my son, I realized his favorite grapes were almost all gone. Before I could even feel sad about it, Tony showed up with the police officer. She stole my goods. Ma'am, you are now under arrest. The sudden change left me completely stunned. But just as the police were about to arrest me, Tony caught sight of my little boy and the poor kid's face made him feel pity. Officer, I made a mistake. But to Tony's surprise, even though he told the police, he got the wrong person, They still refused to let me go because the fruits on the ground were enough proof I was a thief. Tony felt awful about it all, so while the officer was distracted, he quietly handcuffed the cop to a chair, then signaled me to run. At that moment, I understood what he meant, and with Tony's help, I escaped the chase. Little did I know that experience cured me of my stealing habit. A week later, I took my kid to visit Tony again, but this time I didn't steal anything. Instead, I handed him a small bag. What's this? Everything I stole from you. I'm very ashamed. My words made him smile with relief, but Tony didn't want to accept it, so he gave the bag back to me. He didn't realize what I needed now wasn't sympathy. I'll earn money someday and I will bite. My words seem to spark something in Tony's mind, so he quickly called out to stop me. I always wanted to take some time off, but I don't have anybody to cover for me. His offer caught my attention. Then Tony pulled out a stack of cash. Take this. No, I look, my employees shouldn't live on the street. You should rent an apartment. I knew the boss had told him to do this on purpose, but for the sake of my child, I still took the money.

She was gonna upload it into the database and geotag me. I can't allow my location to be compromised. The black helicopters, they can land in Central Park. That is part of the UN's controlled airspace. Okay, so then you grabbed her. I searched her for wire and make transmitters that look like buttons. That's why you cut her clothes off. I ordered her to abort a mission and now we'll abort this interrogation What have I told you about talking to the police without an attorney, Peter? No, I just have to send form DD five.

But no one ever questioned my real gender because by then, I had already become a star in the WNBA, and my teammates didn't care who I used to be. But when the coach announced we'd have a team physical, I suddenly worried everything will fall apart. Back in the NBA, my playing style was so aggressive. As long as I was on the court, we always won, and my teammates barely touched the ball. But after I did a strip tease in public, the league banned me for life, and I lost my house in my car. One day, I passed by an outdoor court, and watching the girls play sparked an idea. Basketball had men's and women's leagues, and I was banned from the NBA, but not from the W NBA. So I decided to disguise myself as a woman. In that moment, I went from a man to a woman. I asked my agent to reach out to the women's team and recommend me to the coach. The coach said he needed to see my skills first, which was easy for me. I beat every woman on that court, from layups to deep threes. I handled everything. The coach had no choice but to sign me. No one suspected I was pretending to be a woman. Every morning, I had to dress up like a pretty girl, and when the police checked my ID, I told them I'd had gender reassignment surgery, so they return my license and let me go. Soon. I blended in perfectly with my teammates. I went to the salon with the captain. We even shop for clothes together. But I couldn't change the way I played, and the coach exploded over it. But the more time I spent with the girls, the more I enjoyed being around them. Slowly, I built real bonds with them. The coach even named me MVP and gave me a limited edition Banshee's team ball. After all my years in the NBA, it was the first time I felt like part of a team. I told them I wore my Jersey in the shower for luck, and we kept winning game after game. My real identity slowly faded into the background. But during the championship game, I dunked with everything I had and didn't even notice my wig coming loose. In an instant, I became a fraud. Everyone backed away from me. I had become a joke, and without me, the whole team fell apart. During halftime, I gathered my courage and apologize. I told them I never wanted to trick them. I just love playing basketball with them. In the end, they forgave me, and with my encouragement, they won the game. When I face judgment from the NBA, the entire women's team came to defend me. With their support, I was finally forgiven, and I even started dating the team cap.

The moment I stepped inside, an AI voice announced the handcuffs could be unlocked. Screens looped ads for upgraded cells. I shouted for a lawyer. Lawyer ads instantly popped up. The cheapest option cost $10,000. I had no choice but to take the free public defender. Turns out the lawyer was AI too. It told me the appeal failure rate was 88%. It even advised me to plead guilty. Even with good behavior, I'd serve 40 years. You want to plead guilty? Please repeat the words. Plead guilty. No, no, no. I'm not guilty.

I buried my face in the pillow. Are you going to sleep? Would you like the lights to be turned off for a more comfortable sleep? Yes. I'm sorry. You have insufficient funds to turn off the light. But the television played an ad. Prisoners can earn money through labor. Knitting sweaters provide steady income. To regain my freedom, I decided to sign up press equals to learn knitting skills. My account finally had $5. I called my mom. She started nagging. The moment she answered, I cut her off, explaining I was locked up and needed $10,000 before I could finish. The system cut the call. My balance hit zero. The AI popped up again asking if I plead guilty. Calming down, I resumed knitting. A drone flew over, reminding me the trial time had arrived, demanding whether I plead guilty or not. You want to enter a guilty plea? Please say I plead guilty to accept. Wait, wait. Please state your plea. Wait. Sorry, I didn't get that. Do you want to enter a guilty plea? Please say I plead guilty to accept. I plead guilty. A guilty plea means that you accept responsibility for your actions and that you are ready to face the consequences of those actions. Do you understand? Say yes to confirm. Your guilty plea?

Unexpectedly, this rule breaking behavior was stopped by the coach. I got you here. It was this seemingly simple response that saved Jesse, signing the man's acceptance of him. From that day forward, the man became Jesse's first ever coach. Not only did Jesse rigorously follow the man's physical training regimen, but more importantly, he Learned various street fighting techniques. Okay? Day after day, as the man guided his combat training, Jesse transformed from an outcast into a formidable street fighter, capable of sparring with his mentor. Three years of rigorous training later, the faces of every bully who had tormented him remained etched in his memory like a brand. Now mastering his skills, Jesse sounded the trumpet of vengeance. Soon, Jesse encountered another former bully classmate at the supermarket. This time he was no longer the helpless victim. He intended to make the bully taste the humiliation of losing face in front of the girl he admired. As expected, the bully's fate was grim. Within minutes, Jesse had beaten him to a pulp. Jesse's ultimate target, however, was the leader of this gang. As Jesse stormed toward the leader, sensing danger, the leader frantically searched for a weapon to fight back. Little did he know Jesse was no longer the boy they remember, the one they could push around. Jesse wrapped a beverage bottle in the thug's own shirt and whipped it viciously across His body like a lash, the excruciating pain finally broke the leader's resolve. He immediately handed over the two years worth of unpaid goods to Jesse. Thus, through this battle, without blades or guns, Jesse conquered everyone with his fists. From that day on, no one in the area dared to provoke him lightly. The humiliation he once endured had.

The woman was instantly enraged but completely helpless, only able to watch as they drove away. The man thought he had escaped danger, but then his teammates sent word. The computer showed that ahead of the man was a cliff. If they didn't stop the car, they would definitely be killed in the crash. But not only did the man not stop, he instead floored the gas pedal and accelerated. The next second, he crashed straight through the barrier. It turned out this was the man's prearranged escape plan, prepared for emergency situations. Soon they emerged from the other side of the tunnel.

This guy was living and eating in a billionaire's house without anyone noticing. The billionaire kept feeling like someone else was in the house, but every time he looked around, the man would quietly shift positions, make food onto his plate and even shyly exchange glances with the lady of the house. What no one expected was that the man had Learned his invisibility technique in prison. His name was Jack, a graduate from a top university, yet he never held a real job. Instead, he spent his days sneaking into strangers homes, brushing his teeth with their toothbrushes, taking showers in their bathrooms. The strange part, he'd been living in other people's houses for years and nobody ever caught him because Jack had his own system. Every day he rode his motorcycle around town and stuck flyers on people's doors. If a flyer stayed untouched for more than three days, it meant the house was empty. He'd then break in with his lock picks, listen to the landline voicemails, figure out where the owner went and when they were coming back. And only after confirming every detail would he move in for a few days. And he wasn't freelancing for nothing. He cleaned the place, washed the dirty laundry, and even took photos with the homeowner's family photos before leaving. This odd parasitic lifestyle made him feel strangely accomplished. One day, Jack moved into another new house, but he Had no idea the lady of the house was actually home. She realized a stranger had broken in, yet didn't make a sound. Instead, she quietly observed this bizarre man. She watched him cook food for himself, then wash her dirty laundry afterward. She could tell he wasn't dangerous. Sure enough, when Jack noticed her bathroom scale was broken, he immediately started fixing it. Then he lay down on her bed to rest. Only then did the woman slowly open her bedroom door. Jack nearly jumped out of his skin before he could explain, the house phone suddenly rang and a man's angry, screaming voice blasted from the receiver. Horrified, Jack grabbed his things and tried to flee. When the woman suddenly broke down crying. Seeing the bruises covering her face, Jack instantly understood her husband was abusive. He didn't have time to think. He sped off on his motorcycle, but that woman's desperate eyes stayed in his mind. He turned around. When he returned, he saw the rich husband yanking the woman around, shouting at her for answering the phone late and hitting her. Jack couldn't take it. He made noise in the yard to draw the man out, then grabbed a golf club and beat the abuser down. When the man collapsed, Jack didn't even try to hide. He revved his motorcycle loudly, a signal. Sure enough, the woman, Anna, heard it, walked outside and climbed onto his bike. And just like that, Anna joined Jack's wondering breaking Lifestyle. Together, they wrote around, posting flyers on doors. One day, they slipped into another house. Judging from the photos on the wall, the homeowner was a boxer, but they didn't care. They even took a photo with his portrait and sat on the couch like a cozy couple, drank the man's wine and fell asleep on his bed. What they didn't expect is that the boxer came home early, finding two strangers sleeping in his bed. He immediately beat Jack senseless. Only after confirming nothing was stolen did his wife manage to pull him away. And just like that, Jack and Anna were homeless again. The next day, search for another empty home. But the moment they opened the door, they froze. An old man was dead inside. Jack shut the door ready to leave, but Anna didn't understand why until she saw the body. They tried calling the man's son, but the phone line wouldn't connect. So out of kindness, they buried the old man themselves, cleaned up the house afterward. They finally relaxed until a frantic knock came at the door. It was the old man's son returning home, seeing strangers inside and his father missing. He immediately called the police. Both Jack and Anna were arrested. When police checked their camera, they discovered countless photos, proof that the pair were serial trespassers. Naturally, they suspected them of murder. But after investigation, the old man was confirmed to have died of cancer. Then came another twist. Anna Had been listed as a missing person for months. Her husband arrived at the station furious, accusing Jack of kidnapping her and dragged her away. Jack, meanwhile, was sent to prison for breaking and entering. Behind bars, Anna's face lingered in his mind every day. And to see her again, Jack began training the only skill he knew, his invisibility.

She quietly stuffs paper into the coffee machine outlet. When the boss hits the button, water splashes straight onto him. He thinks the machine just malfunctioned so he hurries into the restroom. But while he is washing his hands, an employee slips into the camera blind spot and walks to the door. She pulls out a hairpin and jams it into the lock. Right after that, another worker pretends to drop a cup. The cleaning lady gets the signal immediately so she turns on the high power vacuum. Co workers having coffee outside hear the noise. They twist open the valve on the gas tank next to them because the restroom vent has already been modified. C 0 2 starts flooding in non stop. Thick white gas pours out like crazy. The boss senses danger. He turns to open the door and escape, but he has no idea the lock is jammed and the loud vacuum outside completely covers his cries for help. A few minutes later, he collapses on the floor and just like that, with everyone working together, the boss is taken out without leaving a trace. The security cameras show nothing unusual. Even the corner rules it as an accidental slip. But the scratches on the inside doorknob tell me he desperately tried to twist it open. If he really slipped by accident, he would not be fighting to open the door. And the floor is anti slip. That makes me Doubt this was an accident, but a carefully planned murder. So I confiscate all the employees phones. After checking their recent activity, I make a shocking discovery. Every one of them visited the same clinic. That cannot be a coincidence. So I drive there. Immediately after pressing for answers, I Learned something terrifying. It all starts with two young men who came in for treatment, said they had constant headaches and insomnia. Blood tests revealed they both had the same unknown substance inside them. Since they were co workers, the doctors suspected the workplace. So we told them to check on their co workers. But that very night, the entire company showed up at the clinic. The doctor was terrified. He never expected everyone to be affected. Some had severe hair loss, some had spotted nails, some even started losing their hearing. Tests this time revealed all their cells were mutating, clearly caused by the unknown substance. During the talk, someone mentioned their boss. The name felt strangely familiar to the doctor. He checked online and realised their boss was the founder of the famous B. Farmer. This gave the doctor a terrifying idea. To verify his suspicion, told them to steal files from the boss computer. And the truth was horrifying. V. Farmer had created a new oral vaccine. To accelerate its development, the boss quickly set up an it company. He dump the oral vaccine into large water barrels and fed it to the unsuspecting employees. Then he Modified the punch machine into a DNA extractor so he could track their physical changes in real time and observe the side effects of the vaccine. Once he had the data, he replaced the punch machine and swapped all the water barrels, all to destroy the evidence. This truth left me shaken. When I returned to face the employees again, my attitude had completely changed. For the first time, I felt sympathy for these killers. I was even glad their plan worked perfectly. After thinking it over all night, I filed my report the next morning. The boss indeed died from a simple accidental slip.

Zelda screamed and ran out to get help while Elisa noticed a creature inside the water tank, something she had never seen before. The next day, her curiosity only grew stronger. So she sneaked into the lab again. She tapped an egg with a spoon and the water reacted instantly. The Fishman sensed her kindness, swam toward her and slowly rose to his feet. Facing the creature's sudden alertness, Alyssa did not panic at all. She gently placed the egg down and use sign language to explain what it was. The Fishman seemed to understand a little. He grabbed the egg and turned away. That single interaction built a sense Of trust between them. After only meeting once, the Fishman already Learned to sign the word egg. From then on, Alyssa brought eggs to him everyday. She even played music for him. And he would quietly accept the egg, then dive back into the water. But when Alyssa turned off the music, he would rise out of the water, calling out for her to keep it playing. This brought a unique joy to Elisa's dull life. A mute woman and a water creature who could not speak built a seamless way of communicating. They became friends just like that, completely unaware that the doctor hiding in the shadows had seen it all.

When the computer starts up, all the keycaps stand up ready for work. Unfortunately, the owner is a huge fan of gaming. As soon as the game starts, the owner keeps pounding away at the keyboard, and the most used keycaps are constantly doing squats, struggling to keep up. Some are so exhausted they can barely catch their breath, even relying on the treadmill to hold themselves up. Meanwhile, the less used keycaps just stand there cheering on the others. A few rarely used keycaps are enjoying the comfortable life provided by the massage chair. There are also a few special keycaps, rarely pressed, but capable of having a huge impact. When they are, they need special care to stay alive. The saddest one is the tab key lying on the sick bed. Just then, the owner's girlfriend walks into the room, and both the Alt and tab keys take a massive hit. The tab key gets pressed too hard and dies on the spot. Seeing this, the other keycaps panic. Tab's death causes the game to freeze. Suddenly, tab seems to come back to life, and the owner's computer unexpectedly switches to the work interface.

El sonido del disparo hizo que la chica escondida afuera, gritara del susto y eso llamó la atención del enmascarado. Siguió el sonido y comenzó a buscar el rastro de la niña. Cuando llegó al dormitorio del segundo piso, la chica estaba escondida debajo de la cama. Por suerte, el hombre enmascarado revisó alrededor, pero no miró debajo. Justo cuando estaba por irse, el teléfono sobre la cama comenzó a sonar, atrayendo otra vez su atención. La chica entendió que si seguía escondida, tarde o temprano la descubriría. Salió de inmediato de debajo de la cama y le disparó al enmascarado, vaciando todo el cargador. El hombre cayó desde el segundo piso y parecía haber quedado inconsciente. La chica pensó que ya estaba a salvo y corrió a ver cómo estaba su madre, pero la encontró convertida en un cuerpo frío.

They believe I could find someone more suitable. I looked at her and answered, then go ahead and find him. I'd been with Natalie for three years. Her parents, Richard and Caroline, belonged to that old Money Country Club crowd. Private schools, summer houses on Long Island. I grew up in a modest Cleveland neighborhood. Paid my own way through public university with scholarships and night shifts. Every dinner with them was an interrogation. Caroline loved dropping memories about Natalie's college boyfriend killing it at a hedge fund. Richard would mention friend's sons who were surgeons or executives. By 35 that Thursday, I walked in exhausted. Natalie was at the kitchen counter, unusually quiet. I had lunch with mom and dad. They're not convinced you're the best long term choice for me. They pointed out differences, earning potential, lifestyle. They feel your career plateaued early. Three years, one proposal, and it boiled down to her parents approval. And you? I asked quietly, what do you think? I think maybe they have a point. Then you should find the guy they want. Ryan, I'm not breaking up with you. I'm just processing doubts. Doubts about whether I measure up. Because your parents said so. That night, I waited until she fell asleep. Then I moved like a ghost. Opened the building portal, submitted a request to remove myself from the lease and transfer it to Natalie. Logged into my Banking app removed her from my platinum card. Wrote a short note explaining she had 30 days to decide on the apartment, left the key on top and walked out at 2 a m. By morning, my phone exploded. The landlord emailed about a lease transfer. What the hell? You canceled my card? How am I supposed to buy food? I ignored everything, found a better apartment, signed the lease, and rebuilt. Day 6, Richard called. We need to talk, son. I'm not your son. Richard, Natalie is falling apart. Meet us tomorrow. I walked into the cafe expecting Richard and Caroline. Instead, the whole family was there. An intervention? I owe you an apology. Richard said I was wrong.

I'm 16 and I live with my mom during the week. Every Saturday I go see my dad at his place. But last Saturday, he texted me to meet at this cafe downtown instead. That was weird already because we always hang out at his house. When we sat down, I ordered an iced latte. Dad made this snorting sound and grinned at me. I asked him what was so funny. He leaned back in his chair and said he pulled a prank on my stepmom. That's when I knew something stupid happened. Dad loves pranks, always has. When I was younger, he'd play videos of cat screaming on his phone just to watch our cat freak out. He'd play dog barking sounds, too. The cat would run around the house looking for the other animals. Dad thought it was hilarious every time. He also used to flip the light switch off when I was in the bathroom. I'd be standing there in complete darkness yelling at him to turn it back on. He'd wait like 30 seconds before flipping it back. Did it at least 10 times over the years. The worst one was with my mom. This was before they divorced. Dad found this fake rubber snake at a dollar store. He knew mom was terrified of snakes since she was a kid. One night he put it right next to her pillow while she was Sleeping. She woke up and saw it in the dark, started screaming so loud. I heard it from my room downstairs. Dad was laughing in the hallway. Mom didn't talk to him for three days after that. So when he said he pranked my stepmom, I already knew it wasn't going to be good. I asked him what he did. He started smiling and said he made her a latte that morning. She's vegan and only drinks oat milk. He knows this. He's told him 100 times. But he made her latte with whole milk instead, regular cow milk. He wanted to see if she could tell the difference. She drank half of it before she asked him if he used the right milk. He started laughing and told her.

He slid papers to me. Years ago, I set aside a trust for family needs. After watching how needs are defined here, I've reassigned it to you for the business. Mom's chair scraped. You can't reward his tantrum. Grandpa's eyes were kind and unmovable. I'm encouraging work and boundaries. I said three things. I want the charges stopped. I want repayment on a plan. My business is mine. Mom pointed at me, finger shaking. You owe us. We raised you. You raised me to be useful, I said quietly. I'm choosing to be respected. No dramatic ending, no group hug. I took the folder and left. That week, I signed a lease on a corner unit. I hired a high school kid named Jess. Mom still sends probes. Family dinner, bring ornaments, I reply. Can't shop hours. Brie rebranded lifestyle content, thrifting tips. She came in once, bought a camera ornament, paid full price. We didn't hug. We didn't fight. Customers started telling me their boundary stories while I lettered names. They left with lighter shoulders. Grandpa sits in back with cross words and says, work is long but honest. That beats applause. What Grandpa did at that table wasn't rescue. He stood beside me while I rescued myself.

So I've always known my son had an interest in men. When he was younger, he'd prefer all the traditionally feminine things like barbies and makeup. He would also play fashion show with things he took from my closet. And as he grew older, he was slow on the pickup of incognito mode. And from the searches he made, I figured he was at least bicurious, if that's the proper term for it. Since he hit puberty, I've never had anything against the community. We live in a pretty accepting town, so he didn't have to worry about me thinking otherwise. Well, last year, he started bringing a boy around and it was obvious they were dating to the point I figured that he knew, I knew and it wasn't a big deal to anyone. Well, apparently I was wrong. After school yesterday, he and his boyfriend came up to me and said there was something really important they needed to tell me. My son said that they were dating and had been for a year. Well, I was surprised that he wasn't aware I knew and was a bit thrown off. My mouth moved faster than my brain and I said, well, that's pretty effing gay. Now. I thought it was peak comedy since it is, in fact, gay. However, I understand using the word gay in that way gives it a very negative undertone, hence the mouth Faster than brain comment. Now, my son and I are usually pretty edgy with our humor, this being fairly tame for the stuff we joke about. While probably not appropriate for the situation, it wasn't our norm for a conversation between us. However, he and his boyfriend were very, very upset and left. He currently won't respond to my texts or calls.

What happened to the BMW we gave you for your 21st birthday? Before I could answer, my mother smiled and said that car belongs to his sister now. My grandpa stayed silent for a moment, deep in thought and what he did next made me truly proud of him. I'm Wade, 26, the family fixer who never says no. I run a small workshop, hand painting Christmas ornaments. My hands always smell like lacquer. People think I'm patient. Truth is I'm conflict allergic. The BMW was Grandpa's gift when I turned 21. A craftsman needs reliable wheels, he said, picking a sensible sedan with a trunk big enough for market racks. Then the creep started. BRI, my 22 year old sister, the influencer needed it for a collab just the weekend. Mom needed my business card for family marketing. I said yes because saying no felt like slamming a door in a library. Soon I was covering their mortgage, $1,800 and then utilities just until Bree's brand deal hits. It never hit, but they kept taking. My card got linked to Bree's growth account. Charges appeared $249 for Promoted Posts, $119 for influencer boosts. I confronted her. Mom said don't be selfish. Your sister's bringing eyes to your little shop. I started tracking everything. At 2 a. M. I built a spreadsheet, mortgage transfers, ad charges asked for a car I couldn't use. Refunded orders Bree promised using My name total eight thousand seven hundred forty two dollars and nineteen cents. The family chat announced Thanksgiving plans. Everyone contributes $300. BRI can't. She's investing in content. Wade will cover for her. I typed and erased 10 responses. Finally, I've covered a lot. I need the BMW back. Stop using my card, mom replied instantly. You're being ungrateful. Grandpa gave that card to our family. We decide what's best. My bank pinged overdraft that week. I slept on the workshop floor. Then came Grandpa's dinner. Roasted chicken can soft rolls. He passed the peas and asked casually the car. What's the story? Mom jumped in. Dad, don't make this a thing, Grandpa smiled without warmth. I'm just asking. Bree stirred her water. It's simple. I'm using it more. Grandpa looked at me and you son. Do you agree it's simple? The word came out small but solid. No. That night I changed every password, closed the joint account, drafted a PDF titled record of transfers and Unauthorized Charges. I sent one mess.

I sighed. Gail was my neighbor and just so happened to be the most popular boy in school. And since I was more of a quiet girl, the type to choose studying for a test over hanging out with friends I didn't have, he always felt safe coming to me for weird favors. He knew I wouldn't judge him. Just last week, he texted me a photo of his armpit, asking if the deodorant stain was visible before his presentation. So now asking me to cut him out of a Halloween costume in between classes didn't even feel that weird. What classroom are you in? I asked. 3B, he responded instantly. I walked to the classroom with a pair of Scissors I had from an art class. As soon as he heard my footsteps, he laughed awkwardly, his handsome green eyes shining through the costume. Thank you so much for coming. This is so embarrassing. I rolled my eyes, fighting back my smile. It's fine. Not like it's anything new. He was wearing a ridiculous inflatable green crayon costume, except it was now completely deflated and he couldn't get it off. I tried cutting, but the Scissors barely made a dent. It's like reinforced with wire or something. As I got closer, I got a whiff of that Cologne he always wears and butterflies raced in my Stomach. I tried to suppress my crush on him by reminding myself he had a girlfriend, Chelsea, the most popular girl in school. Blonde, pretty, she was everything I wasn't. But suppressing my crush didn't really work because that's when he joked. You're breathing really fast. Am I making you nervous? Maybe we can just pull it off, I suggested, ignoring the butterflies that filled my stomach. Worth a shot. His eyes met mine through the mesh window of the costume. You'll have to get pretty close though. I positioned myself behind him, wrapping my arms around to find a grip. Point this okay, more than okay, he said softly then quickly added, I mean, yeah, try pulling from there. We struggled for a few minutes. My body pressed against his back as I pulled. Gosh, why are you so weak? He teased. All that studying and no gym time. Excuse me, I'm plenty strong. I moved to face him, grabbing the costume from the front. Our faces were inches apart now maybe you're just too big. You think I'm big? He grinned and I realized how wrong that sounded. The costume the costume is too big. My face burned. His eyes were doing that thing where they went soft. The same look he'd given me when I explained derivatives to him last week. Your face is really red, he said, reaching up like he wanted to touch my cheek, then dropping his hand. You sure I'm not too heavy? For you. I'm fine. I pulled harder, basically hugging him. Now his hands came up to set.

He leaned over and put his head on my shoulder. I wrapped my arm around him, rubbing his back the way I'd done since we were kids. He was sobbing into my sleeve, and I just let him. That's what we do. That's what we've always done. I heard footsteps behind us, but didn't turn around. What the hell is this? Danielle's voice was ice cold. I looked up. She was standing in the doorway, holding a glass of red wine, face twisted into something ugly. Danielle, I'm just. I started. Shut up. She stepped closer. I knew something was off. The way he talks about you, the way he's always texting you. And now you're in my house with your hands all over my husband. Marcus lifted his head, confused and still half crying. Babe, what are you talking about? I said. Get off him! She slammed her wine glass on the coffee table so hard it cracked. Red wine splashed everywhere. Then she lunged. He came across that coffee table like a wild animal, nails out, aiming straight for my face. I threw my arms up just in time. Her nails Rake down my forearm, drawing blood. Marcus jumped up and grabbed her around the Waist! Pulling her back. Danielle, stop! That's my sister! She was still thrashing, trying to get at me. I don't care what she. My twin sister. My literal twin. She went still. You're what? My twin. The girl in every single childhood photo in this house. The one I talk about constantly. The one who was my best man at our wedding. Danielle's face went from rage to confusion to horror in about three seconds. She looked at me, then at him, then at the family photos on the wall she'd apparently never bothered to actually look at. Marcus let her go and stepped back, his expression completely flat. Eight months married, and you never once asked about the most important person in my life. She moved out that weekend. Divorce papers came a month later.

Your gifts just arrived with some weird note not to be ambushed and humiliated. Silence. Then. What are you talking about? I heard everything, Rachel, last week in your dad's office. The intervention, the financial shaming, packing my things while I sat at dinner. We're concerned about your future. Was it concerned when you called my business a lemonade stand? When you plan and to humiliate me in front of everyone, if you don't come, there will be consequences, she threatened. What consequences? Cut me off financially. I've supported myself for 5 years. Pack my thing. You're already doing that. I deserve better than this, Rachel. I hung up, spent Christmas with people who actually valued me. Messages started rolling in. Relatives saying, dinner Got awkward when Rachel couldn't explain my absence. Some even apologized. After opening my gifts, two months later, I'm standing in my new expanded facility. The retail deal went through. My coffee is going national. Rachel and I are separated. She's furious I embarrassed the family. But I'm finally free. That Christmas, overhearing their plan became the moment I chose myself instead. But the real story of what happened next, the confrontation, the unexpected allies and how my business became bigger than I ever imagined, that's a whole other chapter. Click here for the full story.

I was cleaning paint brushes after teaching my art class when the principal walked in with a small boy. She said, this is Kai. He's joining your class tomorrow. He's been unable to speak since birth. Rare neurological condition. She handed me this thick medical folder full of documentation. His parents enrolled him here hoping art might help him express himself. The kid looked really pale and way too skinny for an eight year old. When I smiled at him, trying to be welcoming, he actually flinched backward, which seemed weird, but I figured he was just shy. The principal mentioned his mother insists on staying for the first class. He's very protective. The next morning, Kai's mother showed up dressed like she was going to a business meeting, not dropping her kid at art class. She immediately announced, if he seems upset, call me immediately. He has special dietary needs and can only eat what I pack for him. She watched him unpack his lunch with this intensity that felt excessive, but I thought maybe she was just an anxious parent. When Kai started painting without me even giving instructions, made a grey house with purple grass, his mother smiled and said, he's so creative. But her smile never reached her eyes. Every class, Kai painted that grey house, but with colours that made zero sense. Purple grass one day, orange sky the next, and an Indigo dog that nobody asked about. My other students kept pointing it out and laughing, saying things like your grass is purple, but Kai never responded or changed anything, even when I gently corrected him and showed him green paint for grass nod but then keep using purple anyway. He just kept painting with this intense focus that seemed strange for a kid his age. After three weeks of classes, I noticed he looked thinner, which didn't make sense for such a short time. He could barely hold the paintbrush steady anymore. By the fourth week, the kid could barely sit up straight in his chair. I asked his mother about it when she picked him up. She explained the doctors say it's normal progression for his condition. I tried calling child

She thought it would secure her a payout. Until the judge asked one question. You ever see someone's face when their own lie destroys them? Because I got a front row seat to that exact moment. Natalie walked into that courtroom eight months pregnant, glowing with confidence. We've been stalling our divorce for a year with every trick in the book. Fake emergencies, missing paperwork, sudden mental health crises that required postponements. But this. This was her grand finale. The plan was obvious. Walk in looking vulnerable, play the abandoned pregnant wife card and watch the judge throw out our iron clad prenup out of pure sympathy. She'd done her research, too. Picked a female judge thinking the sisterhood would work in her favour. What Natalie didn't realise was that her own paranoia had already destroyed. Six months earlier, during one of our screaming matches, she'd called the cops claiming I'd threatened her. Complete lie. But she ran with it. Filed a restraining order. The next day, stood in front of a judge with crocodile tears, claiming I was violent and dangerous. Said she feared for her life and needed protect action. The judge bought it, granted the order immediately. I couldn't come within 500 feet of her, couldn't contact her, couldn't even drive down our old street. My lawyer advised me not to fight it, just let the divorce proceed and move on. So I did exactly. That followed that restraining order to the letter. Didn't call, didn't text, didn't even look in her direction. When I saw her at the grocery store, I had witnesses, security footage, phone records, everything proving I'd stayed away. But here's the thing about restraining orders that Natalie forgot. They create a paper trail. Every violation gets documented. Every interaction gets recorded. The court system tracks everything. Fast forward to today. Now.

He quickly found out how wrong he was. I was driving to target to grab art supplies for my wife when an officer flashed his red and blue lights behind me. I was confused. I was sure I hadn't done anything wrong. Still, I stopped the car near the sidewalk and waited. The officer walked toward my window with a smirk already plastered on his face. I could tell exactly what he was thinking. In shaven baby faced, wearing my old college hoodie and shorts, looking like I was 19 at most, the officer thought he found an easy target, a punk teenager to help him reach his ticket quota. I was getting profiled. License and registration, he said. I quickly handed it all over. He took a look at my ID and laughed. 34? Yeah. Okay, kid, step out of the vehicle. He pushed me against the car and patted me down, asking again what school you go to. You're quite the reckless driver. Speeding, failure to signal, and your tail light looks cracked to me. That's three violations, sir. I wasn't speeding, and my taillight was fine this morning, I insisted calmly. You arguing with me? His smirk got wider as he flashed the weapon by his hip. I pressed my lips together. That's what I thought. See you in court, kid. He handed me the ticket and walked back to his cruiser. I sat there looking At the citations, every single one was completely bogus. Good. I like the challenge. I've been working as a lawyer who specialized in civil rights cases, and this year alone, I dealt with 30 profiling cases like this. I knew every single procedure, loophole, technicality that existed in traffic court. And this one, it required a special loophole. You're really going through all this for a traffic ticket? My wife asked when she saw what I planned. It's not about the ticket, I told her. She didn't get it. But I'd seen too many kids get railroaded by officers like this one. Kids who couldn't afford lawyers, kids who didn't know their rights. This officer probably pulled this stunt constantly because nobody ever fought back. I filed for continuances, requested delays, pushed the court date back four months while I prepared. Then on the morning of the hearing, I showed up early. The officer walked in looking as smug as the day he pulled me over. He was chatting with another officer about how this would be quick, easy win. Just another reckless kid who thought he could fight a ticket. The bailiff called our case number. I stood up and walked to the defendant table.

My mom was terrified of what would happen if I knew when I turned 16. I broke into the file cabinet while my parents were at work. Inside were medical files with my name on them. Dozens of pages going back to when I was an infant. But they weren't normal medical records. The header on every page said Clinical Trial Participant 347, Project Tolerance Study. I read through the documents, my hands shaking so badly I could barely hold the papers. My parents had enrolled me in some kind of research study before I could even talk. The goal was to study the effects of early alcohol exposure on liver development and addiction formation. I was one of 50 children whose parents have been paid to give them alcohol from infancy through adolescence. Study was tracking whether early exposure would create lifelong dependency or if it would build some kind of biological tolerance. There were consent forms with my parents signatures, payment and receipts for thousands of dollars per quarter and progress reports describing my physical and psychological development like I was a lab experiment. The worst part was a section titled Withdraw Protocols. It explain and that if any participant tried to stop the alcohol intake abruptly, they could experience severe medical complications because their bodies had developed physiological dependence. From such a young age, I've been made physically dependent on alcohol. Before I even understood what alcohol was, I heard The front door open. Downstairs, my parents were home early. I shoved everything back into the cabinet and tried to act normal. But my mom took one look at my face and knew. She started crying immediately reaching for me, trying to explain. But I backed away from her. My mind racing through every doctor's appointment, every force drink, every time they'd watched me with those guilty expressions. My dad stood in the doorway saying they've been trying to find a way out for years, that the research program had threatened legal action if they withdrew me before the study was complete, that they've been waiting until I turned 18 so I could make my own choices. But none of that changed what they've done, what I've been made into because of their decision. And then my dad said something that made everything even worse.

We had time stamps for my Uber rides showing I went straight from the party to Mike's apartment. My credit card showed I bought breakfast near Mike's house the next morning. There was no gap in the timeline where I could have been with Ashley. Patricia requested Ashley's medical records through legal discovery. Ashley fought it hard, but the judge ordered her to comply. Turns out Ashley wasn't even pregnant. She'd never taken a pregnancy test, never saw a doctor. The whole thing was completely made up. Patricia also found Ashley's search history from the week before she accused me. She'd been googling things like how to break up a family and can you go to jail for false accusations? We took all of this to court in September, filed a defamation lawsuit asking for damages. Ashley showed up with some cheap lawyer who clearly wasn't prepared. We presented everything. The timeline, the medical records, the search history, Mike's statement. Ashley's lawyer tried arguing that she was confused and made an honest mistake. you can't accidentally make up an entire pregnancy and assault story. The judge wasn't buying it. During her testimony, Ashley completely fell apart on the stand. Started changing her story, contradicting herself. Finally, Admitted she made everything up because she'd actually cheated on Derek with his coworker and needed a cover story. She thought if she could make me look like the bad guy, nobody would question her. When she eventually claimed Derek wasn't the father, the courtroom went silent. Derek was sitting in the back, and I watched his face go completely white. My parents were there, too, and my mom started crying. The judge ruled in my favor, ordered Ashley to pay me $50,000 in damages plus my legal fees. Also issued a restraining order. Ashley and Derek broke up that same day. He called off the wedding and kicked her out of his apartment. Two weeks later, Derek showed up at my door. He looked terrible, like he hadn't slept in days. Started apologizing and saying he should have believed me, that he was sorry for hitting me and cutting me off. My parents sent letters, too, saying they made a horrible mistake and wanted to rebuild our relationship. Part of me wanted to forgive them immediately because they're my family, but another part of me was still furious. I believed a lie without even hearing my side. They abandoned me when I needed them most. Derek's standing in my doorway now, asking if we can grab coffee and talk. Says he'll do whatever it takes to make this right. I honestly don't know what to do.

She got nothing. I met Jessica at a coffee shop downtown when I was 25. She seemed perfect, smart, funny, always knew exactly what to say. We got married after dating for two years and everything felt right. My family has money, not crazy billionaire money, but my grandparents set up trust funds for all their grandkids. Mine was worth about $3 million and I was supposed to get full access when I turned 30. Jessica knew about the trust fund because I told her early on I wanted to be honest about my financial situation. She always acted like it didn't matter, said she loved me for me, not for money. Looking back, I was an idiot. About six months before my 30th birthday, Jessica started acting different. She'd stay late at work almost every night, said her boss was demanding and they had big projects coming up. She stopped wanting to hang out on weekends.

I asked if there was someone else and she swore there wasn't, said she just needed time to think. A week after that conversation, my buddy Eric sent me a screenshot. It was from Jessica's Instagram story posted from some beach resort. She was holding hands with this guy I'd never seen before.

I mean that literally. My earliest memory is sitting in a high chair while my mom measured out exactly two tablespoons of vodka into my sippy cup. I was maybe 3 years old. She'd mix it with apple juice, shake it up and hand it to me with this weird expression on her face like she was apologizing and threatening me at the same time. I thought every kid drank what I drank. I didn't know it was alcohol. I just knew that twice a day, morning and evening, I had to finish my special juice or my parents would get upset if I refused. Dad would sit next to me at the kitchen table for hours until I drank it. No TV, no playing, nothing, until the cup was empty. Every six months, my parents would take me to a medical building downtown that didn't look like a normal doctor's office. No toys in the waiting room, no other kids, just gray walls and chairs that smelled like Leach. A man in a white coat would check my blood pressure, draw blood and ask me questions about how I felt. Did I ever feel dizzy? Did my hands shake? Did I have trouble sleeping? My parents would stand in the corner watching me answer, and something about their faces always seemed wrong. Too still, too careful. The man would nod, write things down, and then Tell my parents to continue the current dosage. That's the word he used, dosage, like I was taking medicine. But I never understood what I was being treated for. When I asked my mom why I had to drink the special juice, she'd say it was to keep me healthy. When I asked what would happen if I stopped, she'd get this look of pure terror and say we couldn't risk finding out. I started noticing things around age 10. Other kids at school didn't have mandatory drinks twice a day. They didn't go to weird medical appointments where doctors took blood samples and measured things without explaining why. When I asked my best friend if his parents made him drink special juice, he looked at me like I was crazy. At home, I started paying more attention. My parents kept a locked file cabinet in their bedroom closet. Sometimes late at night, I'd hear them arguing and whispers about whether they should tell me the truth or wait until I was old.

Now they're homeless and want to move into my house. My brother Jake and I inherited our parents house when they passed away three years ago. The deal was simple. I'd live there and cover all the bills while finishing nursing school, and Jake would move in with his wife Ashley. Once I graduated and found my own place, it was a two bedroom house in a quiet neighborhood. Nothing fancy, but paid off completely. No mortgage, just utilities and property taxes. I was halfway through my final year of nursing school, working night shifts at a diner to pay for everything, when Ashley started coming over more often. She show up unannounced, walking through rooms like she was inspecting them, making comments about how she'd redecorate once they moved in, how my furniture was outdated and would need to go. I tried to be nice about it because she was going to be living there eventually anyway, but then things got weird. Ashley started taking pictures of the house and posting them on Instagram like it was already hers. We caption them things like can't wait to start our life here and future home goals. My friends kept sending me screenshots asking what was going on. In November, Ashley told Jake she was pregnant. I was actually happy for them, offered to move out early so they could get settled before the baby came. Ashley said no, she wanted to wait. Until after I graduated in may. Said it would be easier to move once. That should have been my first red flag. Two weeks later, Jake called me at two in the morning, screaming. Said I needed to get out of the house immediately. I was so confused. I thought maybe there was a fire or something, but no. Ashley had told him I was doing drugs in the house, that she'd found needles in my bathroom and pill bottles hidden in the kitchen, that I was dangerous to be around. Ashley with a baby coming. I tried to explain that I was in nursing school. I had medical supplies for my clinical rotations. The pill bottles were over the counter vitamins, but Jake wouldn't listen. Ashley was crying in the background. About how scared she was, how she'd seen me acting paranoid and aggressive. None of it was true. Jake gave me 48 hours to pack.

I teach 10th grade English at a public school in Ohio. Three weeks into the fall semester, one of my brightest students, Devon, stopped showing up to class. He'd been getting straight A's, always participate. The kind of kid who actually did the reading. When he came back two weeks later, the school counselor, Mrs. And Guian, pulled me aside in the hallway. Devon's father passed away suddenly. Heart attack. He's having a really rough time. Just wanted to give you a heads up. I waited until after class that day and pulled Devon aside. Hey. I heard about your dad. I'm really sorry. Listen, don't worry about any of the work you missed. We. I already took the state exam, so as far as I'm concerned, you're done with the requirements. Just focus on getting through your other classes and taking care of yourself. He nodded, didn't say much. I could see he was barely holding it together. For the next two months, Devin showed up to my class every day. He did every assignment I gave, even though I told him he didn't have to. Solid E+ work. Not his usual A's, but considering everything, I was just glad he was functioning. Then, in early December, I got an email from Ms. Nguyen asking me to attend a meeting about Devon. I checked my grade book. He was doing fine in my class, so I had no Idea what this was about. I walked into the counselor's office and saw four other teachers sitting there. Missus Harrington from history, Mr. Lopez from math, Missus Lynn from science, and Coach Davidson, who taught health. Miss Inguyen started the meeting. Devon is failing four out of six class. He's in danger of repeating the entire year. The only classes he's passing are English and PE. I wanted to bring everyone together to figure out a plan. Missus Harrington jumped in immediately. He's missed over twenty assignments in my class. I told him he could make up ten of them, but he hasn't turned in a single one. At a certain point, we have to hold students accountable. Mr. Lopez nodded. Same situation in math. He won't stay after school for tutoring. Won't ask for help. Just sits there. I looked at Miss Minion. What exactly did you want my input on? He's doing fine in my class. Missus Harrington turned to me, clearly annoyed. That's exactly the problem. You're enabling him. I don't see why we even needed you here. You just let the kids skip out on work. That's not helpful. That's not teaching. The room got quiet. I leaned forward. His dad died eight weeks ago. You really think 20 history worksheets about the French Revolution matter to him right now? Structure matters. Missus Harrington said, these kids need to learn that life doesn't stop just because something bad happens. That's a valuable lesson. He's 16. I Said he just lost his father. The valuable lesson he's learning right now is that half his teachers care more about their grade books than his dead parent. Coach Davidson shifted uncomfortably. Mister Lopez stared at his hands.

Coach Davidson, shifted uncomfortably. Mister Lopez stared at his hands. Missus Harrington's face went red. That's completely unfair. I offered him extensions. The door opened. Devon walked in. He wasn't supposed to be there, but Miss Nguyen had clearly texted him to come down without telling the rest of us. Missus white Harrington didn't notice him standing by the door. She kept go. These kids need to understand that grief doesn't excuse laziness. My mother died when I was in college, and I still graduated on time. Devin stood there for a second. Then he spoke, his voice completely calm. You're absolutely right, Missus Harrington. My dad dying was super lazy of me. I should have asked him to schedule his heart attack for summer break. That way it wouldn't inconvenience your lesson plans. Every head in the room turned toward him. Missus Harrington's face went from red to white in about two seconds. Devin looked at each. Sure. One by one. Mister Lopez, I'm sorry I didn't stay after school for tutoring. I was too busy planning my dad's funeral and helping my mom figure out how to pay the mortgage. Missus Lynn, I'm sorry I zoned out during your lab on cell division. I was thinking about how my dad's cells stop dividing permanently. He turned to me. Mister Lane, thanks for being the only teacher who treated me like my grief mattered more than a history worksheet. At least one person here remembers I'm A human being. Then he walked out. Didn't slam the door, just left. The room was completely silent. Miss Nguyen closed her laptop. I think we're done here. Missus Harrington tried to say something, but Miss Minguean cut her off. Actually, I need everyone except Mr. Lane to leave now. After they filed out, Miss Minguean looked at me. I recorded that whole thing. I'm sending it to the principal. Harrington's getting transferred. Devon passed all his classes that year. The other teachers suddenly found ways to be more flexible with deadlines. Missus Harrington got moved to a different school that summer. Last I heard, she's teaching somewhere in Kentucky now. Devon graduated two years later. Gave a speech at graduation about his dad. Didn't mention missus Harrington once. That's class.

Every 30 seconds I have to pause so she can breathe. She's doing this weird gasping thing, trying not to make noise, but clearly in agony. I ask her multiple times if she wants to stop. Each time she shakes her head violently and says to keep go. At one point she literally says, just get it done. I don't care. Like we're talking about ripping off a Band Aid and not a 15 hour tattoo project. An hour passes and I've barely finished the outline of one wing tip, maybe 5% of the total design. She's full on sobbing now, shaking so hard I can't keep my line steady. Other clients in the shop are starting to look concerned. One guy waiting for his appointment asks if she's okay. I finally turn off my machine and tell her straight up, we need to stop. This isn't working and I can't continue like this. He starts begging me to keep going, saying she can handle it. She just needs to push through. I tell her that's not how this works, that she's going to associate this tattoo with trauma and regret it forever. That's when she completely breaks down. Through sobs, she tells me her ex fiance just got engaged to someone else. They've been together six years and he proposed to the new girl after only 8 months. She wanted to get these wings, post them all over Social media show everyone she's thrive having and has moved on and is doing something bold and beautiful. She admits she doesn't even really like angel wings that much. She just wanted something big and impressive that would get attention, something that would make him see what he lost. I sat there for a minute just processing all of that. Then I told her the most impressive thing she could do right now is be honest with herself. I offered to design her a small, simple feather instead, something meaningful she could actually complete without torturing herself, something for her, not for him. She agreed in the moment, even paid me for the hour we'd spent. I drew up three different feather designs for her and told her to come back whenever she was ready. She never came back. Months later, I saw her Instagram and she'd gotten a tiny heart tattoo at some other shop, not even visible unless you knew where to look.

Kylie is 9 years old and has been so pumped about being an aunt. She kept asking me when she could finally meet her niece, sending me excited texts with a million exclamation points and baby emojis for weeks. The thing is, Kylie has a physical disability. Her hands shake when she holds things, and she struggles with stuff like buttoning shirts or holding a pen steady. It's just something she was born with. But she's gotten way better over the years with physical therapy and practice. When my daughter was born three weeks ago, my whole family came to visit at the hospital. Kylie walked in with this huge smile, holding a stuffed giraffe she'd saved up her allowance money to buy. She stood next to my bed and just stared at the baby with these wide eyes. I hold her, she whispered. Before I could answer, our mom jumped in. No, honey. Maybe when you're older. Kylie's face fell. But I'm old enough now. I've been practicing with my dolls. Mom shook her head and pulled Kylie away from the bed. Your hands can't be trusted around a Newborn. It's too dangerous. I watched Kylie's eyes fill up with tears, but she didn't argue. She just nodded and sat in the corner chair clutching that giraffe. The whole visit, she barely said anything, just stared at the floor. After everyone left, I couldn't stop thinking about her. Face. So when we got home from the hospital, I texted Kylie and told her to come over the next afternoon when mom was at her book club meeting. She showed up wearing her favorite purple hoodie, the one with the cat ears. She looked nervous. I sat on the couch and positioned pillows on both sides of me. Then I had Kylie sit right next to me, super close. I'm going to put the baby in your arms, but I'm keeping my hands under her the whole time, okay? Kylie nodded so fast, I thought her head might fall off. I carefully placed my daughter in Kylie's lap. My hands stayed underneath, supporting the baby's head and body. Kylie's hands were shaking a little, but she kept them steady by resting her elbows on the armrest. She stared down.

I explained the whole thing again. Limited supply, long line of kids still waiting. Can't give out cups of whipped cream or will run out before everyone gets their cocoa. The mom just stares at me like I told her kid to go kick rocks, then turns around and walks away in a huff. Then it gets worse. This teacher, who doesn't even work with this class, he's just there because her own kid, goes to the school, comes up and asks for the same thing. Can my son have a cup of whipped cream? And again, five other kids immediately start asking for the same thing. I give her the same explanation. There's still a line going out the door and down the hallway. I've got maybe two and a half cans of whipped cream left. If, if I start handing out cups, we're going to run out and the kids at the end of the line won't get any for their drinks. So no, I can't do that. She walks away without saying anything. I turn around to help the next kid in line make their cocoa. When I turn back around, that same teacher is holding the whipped cream can and spraying it directly into a cup for her kid. She just took it, didn't ask again, didn't wait for permission, just grabbed it off the table when my back was turned and did it anyway. And that opened the flood gates. Every kid who saw that immediately started asking for their own cup. For the next 45 minutes, I had to keep saying no over and over and over again, while kids gave me dirty looks and parents whispered to each other. One dad even made a comment under his breath about some volunteers being difficult.

The teacher asked our parent volunteer group to bring cookies and hot chocolate for this winter event thing. I figured why not make it a little special? So I grabbed marshmallows, whipped cream and sprinkles from the store. Nothing fancy, just the usual toppings you throw on cocoa. The event starts and kids are lining up. First girl in line walks up, looks at everything and goes, I don't want hot chocolate. Can I just have a cup of whipped cream? She's literally holding a chocolate chip cookie in her other hand and eating it. So I know it's not an allergy thing. She just wants a cup of straight whipped cream like it's a snack. Before I can even answer, five of her friends immediately start going, me too, me too, I want whipped cream, too. I can see exactly where this is going. I've got maybe three cans of whipped cream total and there's like 60 kids at this event. If I say yes to her, every single kid in that line is going to want their own cup of whipped cream and the last 20 kids won't have any for their actual cocoa. So I tell her no. I explain that I only brought enough whipped cream for people to put on their drinks. If I give her a whole cup, everyone's going to want one and we won't have enough. I even offer her a cup of water if she's thirsty. She just glares at me and stomps away. I think that's the end of it. Wrong. Five minutes later, this woman comes marching up to the table. My daughter said you refused to give her whipped cream. I'd like a cup for her, please. And just like before, the second she says it, a bunch of other kids start yelling.

I noticed my 150 dollar bottle of Chanel perfume was getting low way too fast. At first I thought maybe I was using more than usual, but I keep track of that stuff since it's so expensive. I marked the bottle with a tiny piece of tape to see if I was going crazy. Three days later, the tape had moved down half an inch. My roommate Katie was definitely using my perfume while I was at work. This girl makes double what I do, but apparently thinks my stuff is fair game. She always complimented how good I smelled, asking what perfume I wore. I told her the brand but never the exact one. Thinking she'd buy her own, I decided to test it further. I put a hidden camera in my room, one of those tiny ones that looks like a phone charger. Sure enough, the next day while I was in class, there she was. Katie walked into my room, went straight to my dresser and sprayed herself with my perfume. Not just a little spritz either. She gave herself a full body spray down like she was getting ready for a date. That's when I noticed she was also using my expensive moisturizer and trying on my jewellery. This chick was treating my room like her personal boutique. She even took a selfie wearing my grandmother's ring, which made my Blood boil. But instead of confronting her, I came up with a better plan. I bought an identical Chanel bottle online for cheap and filled it with a special mixture, liquid ass spray, some garlic juice, a tiny bit of fish sauce and water. It looked exactly like perfume but smelled like someone had died and been buried in a gym sock. I put it in the same spot and waited. The next morning, Katie came down for breakfast smelling absolutely horrific. She had that confident strut she always had when wearing my real perfume, completely unaware that she smelled like a dumpster behind a seafood restaurant. Our other roommate, Emma, immediately asked what that awful smell was. Katie got defensive and said she didn't smell anything weird. But throughout the day, I watched her getting more and more confused. As people kept their distance, she kept sniffing herself, trying to figure out what was wrong. The smell got worse as the day went on because body heat activated it.

So I made sure the court knew why she really left my sister. Rachel was allowed to do things crazy even for her golden child status. Skip school to party and underage drink. And our parents would write her excuse notes. She'd steal money from my college fund and they'd say she needed it more. But then she got pregnant at 18 by some random guy at a house party. And out of nowhere they told her no. She wanted to give it up, but my parents refused to let her consider it because family takes care of family. The problem was, Rachel had zero interest in taking care of anyone but herself. After Lynn was born, she'd leave her screaming in the bassinet while she talked on the phone for hours. She forget to feed her, then get annoyed when Lin cried from hunger. I'd come home from my college classes to find Lin sitting in dirty diapers because Rachel couldn't be bothered to change her. The night everything changed, Rachel left three month old Lin alone in the apartment for eight hours to go clubbing. I only found out because the landlord called me about the non stop crying, broke down the door and found Lynn dehydrated and hoarse from screaming. Rachel stumbled home at four in the morning reeking of alcohol, and when I confronted her, she actually rolled her eyes and said, I was being dramatic. That's when I filed for emergency custody. Rachel showed up to court in a crop top and told the judge she was too young for this responsibility. Anyway, she signed over her rights without even reading the papers. For six years, I raised Lynn as my daughter. I dropped out of college to work full time and Learned to function on three hours of sleep. But watching Lynn grow from a neglected baby into this confident little girl who loved science experiments made every sacrifice worth it. Then Rachel got engaged to some investment banker named Marcus. Suddenly, she wanted Lynn back. She hired an expensive lawyer, claiming I'd stolen her daughter and that she'd been suffering from postpartum depression. My legal aid attorney said things didn't look good because courts favour biological parents and Rachel now had money and a big house while I was single in a small apartment. That's when I remembered the pregnancy journal our mom had given Rachel that might still be in our parents basement. I found it in a box of her old things and what I read made my hands shake. Page after page of Rachel writing about how much she hated being pregnant.

She opened the top drawer and took out my grandmother's wedding ring. My grandma died last year from cancer and she left me that ring in her will. It's a simple gold band with three small diamonds, but it means everything to me. My niece held it up to the light and then shoved it in her pocket. They stayed for almost three hours, ate our chips and cookies. They put their shoes up on our coffee table. One of the guys even laid down on our couch like he was taking a nap. They left through the front door at around 3 and didn't even bother locking it behind them. I called my sister immediately. I told her exactly what happened and said if my niece didn't return everything in two days, I was calling the police. My sister said she would handle it and hung up. Thursday, I waited all day. My phone didn't ring once. Friday morning I texted my sister asking if she talked to her daughter. She replied saying she was working on it. By Friday night, I still had nothing, no call, no text, no one showing up at my door with my stuff. Saturday morning, I called the police. An officer came to the house and I showed him the footage. He watched the whole thing and took notes. He said it was pretty clear cut and they'd be sending someone to my sister's house to Talk to my niece. I filed an official report and he gave me a case number. About 2 hours later, my phone started blowing up. My sister was calling and texting over and over. When I finally answered, she was screaming at me through tears. She said I should have told her before I called the cops. I told her I did tell her. I gave her two whole days and she did nothing. She said two days wasn't enough time. I said it was enough time to at least call me back or come talk to me. She hung up on me. My niece got charged with breaking and entering and theft. The two guys she was with also got arrested. The police found one of the watches at one of the guys houses. They're still looking for the other watch and my grandmother's ring. My sister had to hire a lawyer for her daughter and now she's not speaking to me. My parents called me yesterday I should have given my sister more time before involving the police. I told them I gave her exactly what I said I would give her and she chose to do nothing.

When my five year old blew out her candles and cut into it, everyone saw what it really was. It's just a joke. She laughed while my daughter started crying. My mom filmed the whole thing on her phone, saying, this is going on social media. Dad laughed hard. She's used to eating trash anyway. Then they tried to feed it to her forcefully. My sister grabbed my daughter's face and tried to shove the dog food into her mouth while she screamed. My uncle held her arms back. Come on, just taste it. I didn't cry or shout. I just smiled calmly and took my daughter home. Rosie had picked out that princess cake three weeks earlier. She'd been making paper chains to countdown to her fifth birthday after her father left. I wanted to give her one perfect day. My sister Denise texted that morning saying she'd pick up the cake. The party was perfect until 2:30. Denise brought out the cake. Three pink tears, edible glitter, princess figurines. Rosie squeezed my hand three times. Our secret signal for I love you. We sang. She made her wish. The knife sank in. The smell hit first. Meaty. Wrong. The inside was brown and chunky. Dog food. Mommy, what is it? It's just a joke. Denise doubled over laughing. Mom had her phone up. This is going on social media. Dad spilled his beer. Laughing? She's used to eating trash anyway. Rosie started crying. Then Denise grabbed her face, scooping up dog food. Come on, birthday girl, take a bite. Rosie screamed. Uncle Harold grabbed her arms from behind. Just taste. The other kids chanted, eat it! Eat it! Denise smeared dog food across Rosie's lips. My daughter was screaming, thrashing, begging them to stop. I felt completely calm. I removed Harold's hands. Let go of my daughter. I picked her up, shaking, sobbing, face smeared with dog food. Party's over. Everyone needs to leave. It was just a joke. Denise said, get out of my house. Then next morning, I called a lawyer. Attorney Patricia Morrison watched the video mom posted on Facebook. Her jaw tightened when Rosie screamed. This is assault. Your daughter was physically restrained, and it's documented. I want charges and a restraining order. This will destroy your relationship with your family. They destroyed that when they hurt my.

All five guilty. Denise, two years in state prison. Harold 14 months. Mom and dad 10 months each. Sheila, one year county jail. Six months later, Rosie and I celebrated, just us, cupcakes and her favorite movie. This is the best party ever, Mommy. Better than last year. We don't talk about last year, Doctor Kim said that was a positive sign. Rosie is 9 now, therapy once a week. She has friends, does well in school. Nightmares occasionally, but she knows I will protect her. Last week, she asked for a birthday party with school friends. Yeah, but only people who are nice. No family last night. Mommy, if anyone tries to ruin it, you'll make them sorry, right? Absolutely. She smiled and fell asleep. Denise works night shifts now. Her kids barely speak to her mom lives alone. Friends avoid her. Harold's wife divorced him. My family thought they could hurt my daughter without consequences. They were wrong.

I, I laughed loudly, but it wasn't a happy sound. Is that what he told you? I demanded. Did you forget why we aren't together anymore? My sister shrugged. He's a sweet kid who didn't deserve you cheating on him. I see Zach has been spreading his own lies, I snarled in disgust. Let me set the record straight. I ran for my life from him. He tried to strangle me because I didn't compliment his suit to the homecoming dance. So I ghosted him out of here because of that. My friends all knew that. You knew that. So why are you all acting like he's the same? My voice rose to a shouting volume by the time I finished my question. My sister stared at me for a moment, then shook her head. Still so dramatic. She Scot, we all know the truth about Zach, so when you're ready to come to your senses, I'll be around. Now get out. She pointed to her bedroom door, shutting down the conversation. I texted each person in the group chat, private messages asking what is going on with Zach? Each person said almost the same thing as my sister. They all thought Zach was amazing and misunderstood because of this story I told about him. I was furious. Somehow Zach found a way to paint me as the horrible person who makes up lies about him. How did I not see this coming? My friends eventually gave me an ultimatum, apologize for lying about Zach or lose all of my friends. Suddenly I knew what to do. I replied to the group chat. Everything I told you about Zach was true. If you really want me to apologize to him, then you aren't good friends anyways. I'd rather be on my own. I blocked them all. I lost all of my friends that day. But what was worse is that I lost my sister, too.

So I kicked them out. And now he can use his talents on the streets instead. The kid's 9 years old and has been stealing since he was 5. It started small candy bars from gas stations, toys from other kids at daycare. My brother would always brush it off. He's just a kid. He doesn't understand property yet. By the time he was 7, Target security had caught him twice. Both times they let him go because he's a minor. My brother actually laughed about it once at a family dinner like it was some cute quirk. I didn't think it was funny then and I definitely don't now. Last year, his school called my brother in because the kid had stolen three different phones from other students, back packs, not borrowed, stolen, hid them in his locker and denied everything until they check the cameras. My brother paid the family's back and promised to get him help. Never happened. No therapy, no consequences, nothing. A month ago, my brother showed up at my door with his wife and the kid. He'd lost his job at the warehouse and they were three weeks from eviction. He begged me to let them stay while he got back on his feet. He's doing Uber Eats now while applying to places, trying to save enough for a deposit. On a new apartment. I said no at first, typically because of his son. But my mom got involved, called me heartless and said, he's your brother. So I caved, told my brother straight up, your kid touches my stuff, you're all gone. He promised it wouldn't be an issue. Two weeks in, I caught the kid in my bedroom going through my closet. I told my brother to control his damn kid or I'd handle it myself. My brother got defensive, said I was being paranoid, that his son was just boring. After that, I bought one of those cheap $30 spy cameras off Amazon and hit it on my bookshelf. I've been saving for 14 months to buy my girlfriend an engagement ring. Every extra shift, every bit of overtime went into that fund. Ford Alley, $200 for a white gold band with a center diamond and smaller stones on the sides. It was perfect. I kept it hidden in a small box tucked under the bottom drawer of my dresser, wrapped in an old T-shirt. Nobody knew it was there except me. Last Tuesday, I came home from work around 6, 8 PM something felt off in my room, but I couldn't place it. Wednesday morning, I went to check on the ring before work. Just wanted to look at it. You know, the box was sitting on top of the drawer instead of under it.

My hands were shaking. I immediately check a camera footage. There he was. Three forty seven PM on Tuesday while everyone else was out. He walked straight into my room, pulled open my dresser, moved things around until he found the box. He opened it, stared at the ring for a solid 10 seconds, then put it in his pocket and left. The whole thing took less than two minutes. I showed my brother the video. He went pale, called his wife in, called his son in. The kids stood there like nothing was wrong. My brother asked him where the ring was. It shrugged and said I left it by the TV in the guest room. Same exact excuse he used when he stole my 300 dollar watch last year. We found that watch two weeks later stuffed in his backpack behind the lining. They tore the guest room apart. Nothing. Checked his backpack, his clothes, under the bed, in the closet. My brother was sweating, his wife was crying and the kid just stood there with this blank expression. Day two, still nothing. I told my brother, either the ring shows up or he pays me back the 40 two hundred dollars. He said they didn't have that kind of money right now. That's why they were staying with me in the first place. Asked for more time. I gave them until Sunday. Sunday came, no ring. My brother kept saying they'd looked everywhere. That maybe it got thrown out by accident, that maybe I misplaced it myself. I showed him the camera footage again. He had nothing to say. Monday morning, while they were all out, I changed the locks. Took about 20 minutes. Then I packed all their stuff, clothes, toiletries, the kids toys, everything, and put it in boxes on the front porch, left a note taped to the door, the ring's worth more than you are. Figure it out. My brother came back around 3 yours PM, started banging on the door, screaming that I couldn't do this, that I was putting a child on the street. I texted him through the door, your son stole 40 two hundred dollars from me and you did nothing. He can steal somewhere else now. He tried calling me 47 times that night. I blocked him. My mom called the next morning crying, saying I was tearing the family apart. I told her the same thing I told my brother. The kid's a thief and nobody wants to parent him. That's not my problem anymore. It's been 5 days. My girlfriend still doesn't know any of this happened. I was supposed to propose next month on our anniversary trip. Now I don't even have a ring. Last night, my brother's wife texted from a motel asking if we could talk. I didn't respond. The ring's still gone and so are they.

My son's been dating Sydney for two years now. Before she first visited, he gave me one strict rule. Don't mention her mother or any family members. Something bad happened, and she's completely cut off from them. I didn't ask for details. It wasn't my place. When I met Sydney, I genuinely liked her. She's thoughtful, respectful, and you can tell she loves my son. We bonded quickly, despite only meeting a handful of times. Last week, they came to visit while I was working on my truck in the driveway. Just routine maintenance. Oil change, checking tire pressure. Basic stuff. Sydney wandered outside, looking curious. What are you doing? I wiped my hands. Just some basic upkeep. Keeps the truck running smooth. She watched for a minute, then admitted, I don't know the first thing about cars. I've always just paid a mechanic for everything. I was surprised. Even basic stuff like this? She nodded, almost embarrassed. Yeah. My dad never taught me, and after he passed, I just never Learned. I can teach you a couple things if you want. I offered. Save you some money. These basics aren't hard. Her face lit up. Really? You wouldn't mind? For the next 30 minutes, I showed her how to check tire pressure, find the oil dipstick, check fluid levels. She was a fast learner, asked good questions, wasn't afraid to get her hands dirty. When she successfully Checked the last tire on her own. I felt genuinely proud. I smiled, patted her shoulder, and without thinking, said, well done, my daughter. The words just slid out. It's what I always said to my son when he Learned something new. But instantly, everything changed. Sydney smile vanished. Her face went pale. Then her eyes filled with tears. Deep, gut wrenching sobbing. She dropped to her knees on the garage floor, wailing, full body shaking, curled up in a ball. I crouched down immediately. Sydney, what's wrong? But she couldn't respond. She was hyperventilating, crying so hard she couldn't breathe. I tried everything. Rubbing her back, offering water, but nothing worked. My son came running out, face going from confused to panic. Panicked. What happened? I don't know. We were just. He didn't wait. He helped Sydney inside to his old bedroom. The door closed. I stood frozen in my driveway, completely lost. Two hours passed. My son brought her dinner upstairs. Finally, around 9 p m, he came down. His face was hard. What did you. I bumped into my ex and her husband at a wedding, and he thanked me for cheating. So I set the story straight. That she was the one who cheated. I'm at my buddy's wedding when I see Betty, my ex from 20 years ago. We dated for two years, and honestly, I thought she was it for me. I was 21, she was 26, and I was complete, completely in love. With her. Her family treated me like I was already part of the family. Her mom would invite me over for Sunday dinners. Her dad and I would watch football together. And her younger siblings called me their future brother in law. Then one night, everything fell apart. I had a massive organic chemistry final. The next morning, Betty wanted to go out drinking with her friends, and I told her I couldn't. I needed to study. She got pissed, said I was being boring, and left anyway. The next day, her best friend Rachel showed up at my dorm. She hated me. Always had. She looked way too happy when she told me Betty had hooked up with some guy at the bar. I didn't believe her at first, but she had photos on her phone. I felt. I called Betty immediately. She didn't deny it. Just said, I'm coming home now. We'll talk in a few. Don't do anything stupid. That told me everything I needed to know. If she had nothing to hide, she would have denied it on the spot. So I drove to her apartment, grabbed the few things I kept there. My toothbrush, couple shirts, some textbooks, and I left before she got back. For the next four months, she tried everything. Called me constantly, showed up at my dorm. I had campus security put her on a no visitor list since she wasn't a student. She was literally escorted out twice. I never Answered a single call. I figured if she wanted me, she wouldn't have done what she did, so why waste time listening to excuse? Eventually, she stopped trying. I moved on, graduated, built a whole life. I honestly hadn't thought about Betty in years. So imagine my shock when I walk into this wedding and there she is with her entire family. Turns out my buddy was marrying into her extend did family. Different last names, and I never connected the dots. I braced myself for awkwardness, maybe some cold shoulders, but weirdly, her family was being super friendly. Her mom hugged me, her dad shook my hand, her brother even bought me a beer. I was confused, but figured maybe they were just being polite. Then the reception started, and things got interesting.

But the job I took next made them regret everything. The Stanford acceptance letter was still trembling in my hands when mom dropped the bomb. Honey, sit down. We need to talk about your college fund. My stomach dropped. Travis was at the kitchen table, head in his hands. I already knew it's gone, dad said, not meeting my eyes. Your brother got into some trouble with dangerous people. We had to use the money to pay off his gambling debts. $50,000, Four years of straight A's, countless all nighters, my entire future gone. This is the third time, I said quietly, the third time you've bailed him out. Mom's hand went to Travis's shoulder protectively. Family comes first, Willow. Your brother could have been seriously hurt and I don't matter. Dad actually laughed, a short dismissive sound. Don't be dramatic. Community college is still one option. You don't really need Stanford. Plenty of people do fine without fancy degrees. Travis finally looked up. I'm sorry, will. I'll pay you back. I swear you said that last time, I whispered, and the time before that. I left the room before they could see me cry.

But I worked harder than I'd ever worked in my life. I memorized everyone's schedules, reorganized their chaotic filing system and stayed late reading case files. Three months in, I was sorting documents when I overheard Mr Mills talking in the partner's lounge.

Another voice laughed. A receptionist who actually reads the briefs. That's a first. She's wasted at that desk. Parker, I'm thinking of moving her to paralegal. My hands rose on the coffee pot.

Twelve years later, he showed up at our door, so I let him see what he missed. We'd only been married two weeks when I found out I was pregnant. John was over the moon, went to every ultrasound, painted the nursery blue because we were having a boy. He spent hours assembling this while I watched, feeling grateful I'd married someone who wanted to be a dad. At 28 weeks, I was at my baby shower with 15 friends. I just unwrapped in onesie when the first contraction hit. Felt like someone squeezing my insides with both hands. My friend Helen saw my face go, Mary, what's wrong? I think something's happening, I said before another wave hit. Helen got me in her car, called John, drove straight to the hospital. The nurses rushed me into a room. The doctor confirmed I was in active labor. Way too early, but it was happening. John burst through the doors 10 minutes later, terrified. He grabbed my hand. As the contractions got worse, the doctor said, okay, one more push. I pushed with everything I had. Then a baby crying. It's a girl, the doctor announced, holding up this tiny infant. John's hand went limp, his face drained of color. What? That's impossible. The ultrasound showed a boy multiple times. Before either of us could process it, the doctor's expression changed. Wait, there's another One another what, John asked. Voice rising. Another baby. Push again, Mary. I pushed. Another cry filled the room. It's a boy, I started crying. Two babies. How did we not know? The doctor was staring at the monitor with intense focus. Mary, I need you to push one more time. There's a third baby. What? John shouted. Thirty seconds later, another baby was crying in the delivery room. Triplets, doctor said calmly. Two boys and a girl, small, premature, but breathing on their own. All three were taken to the NICU. I was wheeled to recovery barely conscious. John followed the nurses but didn't come back to my room. Hours later, he appeared in the doorway. His face was Gray. Express mindless. John, I reached out my hand. He stayed where he was. How did this happen? I don't know. I'm as shocked as you. This wasn't the plan, Mary. We planned for one baby. I know, but I can't do this. His voice was flat, emotionless. Can't do what? Three kids? I didn't sign up for three. My heart stopped. John, there, your children. I need time. He turned and walked out. I stayed in the hospital five days. John came once, asked my doctor how ultrasounds could miss two babies. She explained sometimes they hide behind each other. One in a million pregnancies. He didn't hear the miracle part, only the burden. When the babies were cleared to go home.

When my parents said I should figure it out myself, I tell her everything. The secret planning, the Assumption I'd babysit, how they didn't even invite me to her retirement Celebration. She goes quiet for a long minute. Then she says, those idiots. And tells me she's going to handle it. The next day, my sister texts, asking what time she should drop the kids off before their light. I respond, have an amazing trip. Don't worry about a thing. They leave yesterday morning. I watch from my window as my sister loads four car seats into her van, looking stressed but happy. Two hours later, I'm at the airport with my own suitcase. I don't tell anyone. Not a single person knows I'm on the same ship until I'm literally standing at the port watching my family board ahead of me. I hang back, wait until they're through, then get on myself.

The look on her face is something I'll remember forever. My sister found me next by the pool the following morning. She starts going off about who's watching the kids. How could I do this? This is so selfish. That's When Aunt Linda appears, turns out she upgraded my room to be next to hers. She looks at my sister and says, maybe if you'd actually invited her like family, she wouldn't have had to buy her own ticket. My mom tries to guilt trip me. What about the children? Who's watching them? I smile. That sounds like a you problem. You made plans without asking me? I made plans without asking you. Funny how that works. They had to pay emergency rates for a last minute nanny service. Four kids under four, two weeks, no notice. I looked it up later. Cost them almost three grand each. Right now I'm on day five. I've been snorkeling, had spa treatments, and spent every evening with Aunt Linda hearing stories about her 40 years of teaching. She told me yesterday, I'm in her will now. Now. But my siblings aren't anymore. My phone's been blowing up constantly. Calls, texts, voice mails from my parents, my sister, even my cousin, saying I'm tearing the family apart. I finally responded once. Family includes everyone or it includes no one. You made your choice. Then I turned my phone off and ordered another Margarita. Best vacation of my life.

Inside was a prescription bottle with someone else's name on it, rohypnol, date rape drugs. My hands shook as I took a photo. I kept digging. There were four more bottles, all different names, all controlled substances. Under those, a burner phone. I pocketed the phone and went back to dinner like nothing happened that night. I went through everything. Text messages about drug deals, photos of pills packaged for sale. Then I found the messages that made my blood run cold. Conversations about a girl named Emily who'd been at a party six months ago. Messages about how much rohypnol to use, how to avoid cameras, coordinates to a storage unit. I drove to that storage unit at 3:00am. The lock was cheap. Inside I found Emily. She was alive but barely, dehydrated, malnourished, chained to a wall. I called 9 1 1 and waited with her until police arrived, telling her she was safe over and over while she sobbed. The police arrested Marcus at my parents house at dawn. Mom called me screaming that I destroyed their golden boy over some misunderstanding. Dad said I was jealous and always had been. They hired a 50 thousand dollar lawyer and tried to get charges dropped. The evidence was overwhelming. Three other girls came forward. The drug dealing, the kidnapping, the assaults. Marcus got 25 years. The trial was brutal. My parents sat behind him every day. Glaring at me when I testified, mom told reporters I planted evidence out of sibling rivalry. Dad said I was mentally unstable and had always been troubled. At sentencing, judge addressed my parents directly. Your son is a monster and you're enabling created him. You ignored every warning sign because you couldn't accept that your golden child was broken. The family hasn't spoken to me since. Mom sent one text. I hope you're happy. You destroyed this family. I blocked her number. Last I heard, they'd sold their house to pay legal fees and moved to Florida. I visited Emily in the hospital. She's in therapy now, rebuilding her life. Sometimes justice feels less like victory and more like surviving the wreckage. But I'd make the same choice every time.

Were giving her stability during a difficult time. Mom said proudly, be patient with her, James. She's fragile. Three weeks in, Victoria was sitting at the kitchen table, crying.

Dad stepped closer. Pack your things. You're not staying under this roof another night. You're a disgrace to this family. I tried reasoning with mom. She knows I Wouldn't. Please. Mom shook her head, tears in her eyes. I wanted to believe you, but Victoria has bruises. She showed us bruises. I had no explanation for no alibi, for no defense against. My dad called my older brother, Marcus, excited with them immediately. Our little cousin wouldn't lie about something like this. By evening, I was standing on the sidewalk with two duffel bags and $340 in my bank account. My phone buzzed with a text from Marcus. Don't ever contact Mom, Dad, or Victoria again. You're dead to us. I crashed on a friend's couch, picked up extra shifts, enrolled in community college. My family became strangers. I saw dad once again.

I felt sick to my core when I saw she'd been reading about how drug users lose everything in court. That night, I couldn't sleep and Googled Xanax and Food Taste and it said bitter, which is exactly how my orange juice had tasted lately. When I'd mentioned it to Jenna, she said it was just a new brand. I heard her on the phone in the garage at 3:00am whispering about timing and how everything needed to be ready. When I asked who calls at 3:00am, she said it was about my case. But that made no sense. I bought three home kits and they all came back positive. But the strange part was the levels were going up instead of down. The next morning, Jenna made her special scrambled eggs and watched me eat every single bite, then patted my head and said, all of it, good boy, like I was a dog or something. After she left for work, I was looking for my car keys in her purse, found a pharmacy receipt from right before my drug test for a Xanax prescription. I drove straight to a private lab and paid $800 for rush results. The tech called two hours later and told me to come back immediately because the Xanax levels in my system were high enough to kill someone. Jenna's car was In the driveway when I got home, which was strange because she never came home early. I walked in first with the cops behind me. She was in the kitchen making dinner and smiled when she saw me. She said, hey, baby, feeling better? I said I got news about the results. Her whole face lit up and she asked if they'd overturned it. That's when the officer walked in behind me and she went pale. She actually tried to run, but he blocked the door. She started screaming, he's setting me up. He's the addict, not me. The officer stayed calm and said he needed to collect some items for evidence. He bagged everything from the kitchen while Jenna stood there shaking. When he asked if she took Xanax, she admitted it was for anxiety and got the bottle, which was nearly empty, even though it was a month supply from two weeks ago. The officer read my lab report out loud showing Xanax levels increasing daily but only after eating in the morning, never at dinner. Then he asked why she'd googled how long does Xanax stay in someone's system two weeks ago. She went completely silent before turning to me with tears and saying, baby, tell them this is a mistake. Jenna got five years for attempted murder. Her lawyer quit after reading the evidence. She still writes from prison claiming she loves me.

No one backed her up. She grabbed her purse. Fine. Don't come crying to me when he gets bullied. She and Sebastian's dad left. The door slammed. That was three days ago. Anna called this morning to say she introduced herself as Anna East. At work for the first time in 20 years, Tony told his son's teacher to use Mateo instead of Maddie. Sebastian's mom sent a long text saying, we humiliated her and destroyed the family. I told her she destroyed it the moment she made her children ashamed of who they were. The Celebration is tomorrow. Santiago will be welcomed into this world by family who are finally proud of their names.

Now she's about to find out I'm exposing her in front of her entire family. I'm six months pregnant. My husband, Sebastian is Latino. I'm white. And we're naming our son Santiago Mateo after his grandfather. When we told his mom at family dinner, she put down her fork. Santiago, that's quite a mouthful. What about something simpler? Sebastian said it wasn't up for discussion. She smiled tightly and changed the subject. Next day she called me. I'm worried kids can be cruel and Santiago will make him stand out. Why not pick something normal? I said we were honoring Sebastian's heritage. She sighed. His heritage is American now. Then she texted a list of 20 names, all Anglo, Michael, Christopher, Benjamin. Her message, a name can make or break a child's future. I showed Sebastian. He looked uncomfortable. She did this to my siblings, too. My sister, Anna East, goes by Anna because mom said it was too hard to pronounce. Antonio has been Tony since elementary school. I stared at him and you never thought that was wrong. He looked down. I didn't know how to fight her. That's when I realized this wasn't just about Santiago. Two weeks later, Sebastian's mom threw us a baby shower. When we walked in, every decoration said Baby Sam, balloons, banners, cake, napkins. Sebastian confronted his mother. What is this? She Smiled Sam is a cute nickname, easier for people. I said we were leaving if she didn't take it down. She looked hurt. I already spent money on this. Sebastian's dad pulled him aside. Don't ruin this for your mother. We stayed, but every time someone said baby Sam, I felt sick. After that, she started introducing us as expecting little Samuel. Sebastian would correct her. She'd ignore him. Then came the articles. Studies show ethnic names hurt employment. Teachers discriminate against diverse names. When I didn't respond, she called. I've decided I won't use Santiago, too ethnic for me. I'll call him Sam. Sebastian said, that's not how names work, mom. She went quiet. Then maybe I shouldn't come to the hospital. I can't support you making such a harmful choice. I'd had enough. I told Sebastian to invite everyone to our house for dinner. It was time to end this. The next evening, Sebastian's parents arrived with Anna and Tony. His mom walked in, smile.

I didn't know she was about to raise me better than my own parents ever did. I was 16 when child services called her. My mom had been arrested again, third time that year. My aunt Rachel didn't hesitate, but she had conditions. The schedule was brutal. Wake up 6:00am, eat breakfast, 30 minutes exercise, school, two hours homework before dinner, chores, rotation, lights out. Ten PM, no exceptions. This isn't a vacation, she said. You follow the rules or you leave. I arrived with one duffle bag and an attitude. My whole life had been chaos. Mom's boyfriends rotating through our apartment, eviction notices, dinner from gas stations. Structure felt like punishment. Week 1, I tested every boundary, stayed up past 10, left dishes in the sink. I finished my homework. Rachel didn't yell. She just pointed to the schedule taped on my bedroom door. Day seven, she said, 83 to go. She checked my homework like a drill sergeant, made me redo a whole essay because I didn't try. I told her she wasn't my real mom. She nodded and said, you're right. Real moms let you fail. I won't. Week two, I skipped the morning exercise, found her waiting at my bedroom door at 6:15 with running shoes. We can go together or you can go alone, but you're going. We ran two miles in silence. She Didn't lecture, just ran beside me. Week three, something shifted. She drove 40 minutes each way so I could stay at my old school. Never complained, never mentioned the gas money. She packed my lunch every morning with notes inside. You've got this or proud of you, or bad days don't last. My friend Becca noticed your aunt makes your lunch. That's so weird. I shrugged, but I started keeping the notes. Week 5, I got a C on a history test. Hid it in my backpack. She found it doing laundry. We're fixing this, she said. Every night that week, she sat with me at the kitchen table, quizzed me on dates, battles, treaties. She taught elementary school for 20 years before switching to nursing. She knew how to make things stick. I got a B on the next test. She put it on the fridge. Month two, I came home early, found her crying in the kitchen over bills, stack of overdue notices, calculator, taco. I stood in the doorway.

She nodded and said, you're right. Real moms let you fail. I won't. Week two, I skipped the morning exercise, found her waiting at my bedroom door at 6:15 with running shoes. We can go together or you can go alone. But you're going. We ran two miles in silence. She Didn't lecture. Just ran beside me. Week three, something shifted. She drove 40 minutes each way so I could stay at my old school. Never complained, never mentioned the gas money. She packed my lunch every morning with notes inside. You've got this or proud of you or bad days don't last. My friend Becca noticed. Your aunt makes your lunch? That's so weird. I shrugged, but I started keeping the notes. Week 5, I got a C on a history test. Hid it in my backpack. She found it doing laundry. We're fixing this, she said. Every night that week, she sat with me at the kitchen table. Quizzed me on dates, battles, treaties. She taught elementary school for 20 years before switching to nursing. She knew how to make things stick. I got a B on the next test. She put it on the fridge. Month two, I came home early, found her crying in the kitchen over bills. Stack of overdue notices, calculator, taco

When I got home that evening, she was waiting. My card got declined at lunch. I removed you as an authorized user. What? Why? Because after yesterday, I'm reconsidering everything. Huge fight. She called me controlling, cheap. Said real men take care of their women. I think you should stay somewhere else for a few days. This is my home, too. Your name isn't on anything. Legally, you're a guest. He stormed out to stay with Amber at 2 a m. My security camera showed her trying to get in with her key. I changed the locks that afternoon. She pounded on the door. I didn't answer. Next morning, her car was still in my driveway. She'd slept in the back seat. Mascara smeared, hair a mess. Why are you sleeping in your car? Amber's fiance doesn't want me there. My card got declined at the hotel. What about your parents? They're in Florida. I don't want to explain this. There's a holiday in two miles away. I'll pay for three nights. Over the next two weeks, she cycled through anger and tears, then claimed I'd financially abused her, that I owed her for her contributions, groceries I paid for, cooking rarely, and emotional labor. Take me to court. If you feel you have a case, back down immediately. Two months later, she's in a studio apartment dating some guy from her dental office. Turns out they'd been texting before our breakup. I Got most of my money back from her credit card charges. Jobs doing well? Just finished a custom build that got featured in a motorcycle magazine. Here's the kicker. I was actually saving for a ring. Had $7,000 set aside for it. That money is now going toward a new paint booth for the shop.

It's my son's Celebration today. My mom added, let's be honest, her son is way better than your daughter. I smiled and said, sure, I'll leave. My daughter Mia spent two weeks planning her birthday party. She picked ocean decorations because she's obsessed with sea turtles. She wrote invitations and careful handwriting. She was radiant that morning in her blue star dress. I specifically didn't invite my sister Vanessa or my mother, not out of spite, out of survival. For 11 years, they turned every milestone into a comparison contest between Mia and Vanessa's son Dylan. Dylan walked first, Mia talked first. Dylan made soccer team, Mia made honor roll. Back and forth, exhausting, endless. I'd stop sharing Mia's achievements with them years ago because they'd just find ways to diminish them or pivot back to Dylan. It hurt less to keep her victories private. Two hours into the party, the doorbell rang. Vanessa stood there with Dylan and my mother all dressed up like they were attending a different event entirely. Surprise, my mother chirped, pushing past me. We couldn't miss Dylan's cousin's birthday. I didn't invite you, I said. That was just an oversight. I'm sure we're family. They walked straight into the backyard.

Don't be selfish. We can celebrate both. You haven't said happy birthday to her once since you arrived. That's when Vanessa exploded. Why is that parasite's little brat even the focus here? It's my son's Celebration today. He's the one who actually accomplished something. The backyard went silent. Mia made a small sound like she'd been slapped. My mother nodded in agreement. Let's be honest, Dylan's always been more accomplished than Mia. He's more athletic, more social, more driven. It makes sense to prioritize. Get out of my house, I said quietly. You're being ridiculous. Then Jennifer from the PTA shifted uncomfortably and said, I mean, the scholarship program is very impressive. Another.

Three bounce castles, a face painting team, a florist creating ocean themed centerpieces with LED lights. Mia's eyes went wide. Is this really for me? Version 2.0, I said. Better in every way. I texted parents who'd supported us. New location. She deserves better. Twenty kids showed up, the ones who mattered. Mia was radiant again. The hurt was still there, but underneath, joy. Real joy.

There's nothing to find. Three days later, they were the ones sitting at the table crying because the person I found knocked on their door. I was 17 when I first asked. We, we're eating dinner, just the three of us. And I mentioned how weird it was that I looked nothing like either of them. Mom's fork froze halfway to her mouth. Dad cleared his throat and said, genetics are funny that way. I pushed harder, asked if maybe I was adopted. Mom laughed, but it was that forced kind of laugh people do when they're uncomfortable. You're ours. That's all that matters. Drop it. But I couldn't drop it. Something had always felt off. The way certain relatives would look at me a little too long at family reunions, the locked filing cabinet and Dad's office that they pretended didn't exist. The fact that there were zero photos of mom pregnant with me anywhere in the house. When I asked again a few weeks later, dad snapped, enough. There's nothing to find. You're being paranoid and honestly ungrateful. We gave you everything. That word gave, not raised, gave. So I saved up $60 for my part time job at the grocery store and bought a DNA test kit, did the whole thing in my bathroom at midnight, mailed it without telling anyone. Three weeks later, the results came back and there it was, a match, not some distant fourth Cousin twice removed, sister, a full biological sister named Gemma. She was 23, living 40 minutes away in Richmond. And according to her profile, she'd been actively searching for biological relatives for six years. My hands were shaking when I messaged her. She responded within an hour, said she'd been waiting for this moment since she turned 18. Then she told me everything. Her birth mother's name was Noel. She was 19 when she had Gemma, 21 when she had me. She wasn't some deadbeat who abandoned us. She was a broke single mom working two jobs, trying to keep us fed and clothed. When I was two, Child Protective Services got involved, not because she was neglecting us, but because a neighbor reported her for leaving us with a teenager while she worked overnight shifts. My adoptive parents swooped in during the custody proceedings. They had money, lawyers, connections at the family court.

I forwarded everything to my lawyer without reading them. Monday at work, she showed up in the lobby. We need to talk, she stated loud enough for the receptionist to hear. Any communication needs to go through my lawyer. Her eyes narrowed. After 10 years, I don't even deserve a conversation. I simply repeated, please contact my lawyer and turn to leave. Everyone thinks you've lost your mind. She called after me. What kind of man is that? I kept walking. Her tactics evolved over the following weeks. Initial rage gave way to tearful. Please, I don't understand what happened. We can fix this. Then came the apology email, promises of therapy, change, transformation. My finger hovered over reply until I noticed the apology focused entirely on what she would lose without me, my income, my help, my presence. Not once did it mention my happiness. I forwarded it to my lawyer without replying. Three months in, I rediscovered old hobbies she dismissed. Six months after leaving, I attended a friend's wedding alone. I danced, laughed loudly, stayed until the end helping stack chairs. Not once did I check my phone anxiously driving home. That night, I realized something profound. I was happy.

The control didn't happen overnight. First, comments about my clothes, then who I could spend time with, eventually how I should think. My friends disappeared one by one and bad influences. Family visits became rare with convenient excuses. I had become a guest in my own life. That week, she came home with shopping bags full of clothes she bought for me. Your wardrobe is embarrassing, she declared. These are more appropriate. I thanked her quietly while something inside me screamed. Later, she criticized how I loaded the dishwasher, reorganizing it completely. Just let me do it right, she snapped. And came comments about my weight, my ambition, how my family had no manners. Three days after that dinner party, I sat across from a lawyer in a coffee shop across town. Document everything, he advised. Keep records of controlling behavior, financial information, instances of emotional abuse. I created a secret email account at the library, opened a separate bank account, converting small amounts from paychecks, not enough to raise suspicion, but enough to build an emergency fund. I researched apartments in neighborhoods she'd never visit. The hardest part was maintaining normalcy. I continued nodding at her criticisms, playing the role I'd perfected. But I was now an actor, conscious of his performance rather than someone who'd forgotten he was on stage. Six weeks into preparations, she announced a weekend spa trip. You'll be fine on your own, I suppose. The night she criticized how I'd packed her suitcase, emptying it completely to refold everything while listing my deficiencies, any remaining doubt evaporated. After dropping her off, I drove straight to the bank, withdrew half our joint savings, legally mine, and deposited it into my new account. At home, I packed methodically, clothes, personal items, family photographs, only what was undeniably mine. I placed my house key and a sealed letter on the kitchen counter, brief stating I was leaving and would contact her through my lawyer. No explanations, no accusations, nothing that could be twisted. Driving away felt like emerging from underwater after nearly drowning. My phone stayed off until Sunday morning when I turned it on, 27 missed calls, 43 texts, 5 voicemails. I forwarded everything to my lawyer without reading them. Monday at work, she showed up in the lobby. We need to talk, she stated loud.

I didn't know she was about to raise me better than my own parents ever did. I was 16 when child services called her. My mom had been arrested again, third time that year. My aunt Rachel didn't hesitate, but she had conditions. The schedule was brutal. Wake up 6:00am, eat breakfast, 30 minutes exercise, school, two hours homework before dinner, chores, rotation, lights out. Ten PM, no exceptions. This isn't a vacation, she said. You follow the rules or you leave. I arrived with one duffle bag and an attitude. My whole life had been chaos. Mom's boyfriends rotating through our apartment, eviction notices, dinner from gas stations. Structure felt like punishment. Week 1, I tested every boundary, stayed up past 10, left dishes in the sink. I finished my homework. Rachel didn't yell. She just pointed to the schedule taped on my bedroom door. Day seven, she said, 83 to go. She checked my homework like a drill sergeant, made me redo a whole essay because I didn't try. I told her she wasn't my real mom. She nodded and said, you're right. Real moms let you fail. I won't. Week two, I skipped the morning exercise, found her waiting at my bedroom door at 6:15 with running shoes. We can go together or you can go alone, but you're going. We ran two miles in silence. She Didn't lecture, just ran beside me. Week three, something shifted. She drove 40 minutes each way so I could stay at my old school. Never complained, never mentioned the gas money. She packed my lunch every morning with notes inside. You've got this, or proud of you, or bad days don't last. My friend Becca noticed your aunt makes your lunch. That's so weird. I shrugged, but I started keeping the notes. Week 5, I got a C on a history test. Hid it in my backpack. She found it doing laundry. We're fixing this, she said. Every night that week, she sat with me at the kitchen table, quizzed me on dates, Battle's treaties. She'd taught elementary school for 20 years before switching to nursing. She knew how to make things stick. I got a B on the next test. She put it on the fridge. Month two, I came home early, found her crying in the kitchen over bills.

She never mentioned it to me. Month three, I overheard her talking to my case worker. How's it going, the woman asked. She's doing great, really great. And you honestly, Rachel paused. It's hard, but she's worth it. I pressed my ear against my bedroom door. The 90 days will be up soon. Have you thought about extending every single day? Rachel said, but I don't want her to feel trapped or obligated. She needs to know this was her choice, too. My stomach dropped. I thought she was keeping me, thought I'd finally found somewhere stable. The 90 days ended on a Tuesday. I packed my bag that morning before school, hands shaking, left it by my bedroom door. Rachel saw it when I got home. Her face fell. You're leaving. Isn't that the deal? Ninety days. She sat down at the kitchen table, looked smaller than I'd ever seen her. That was the deal, she said quietly. But I was hoping we could change it. She slid a new paper across the table. New contract, no end date, same rules. But you're family now, not Temporary, permanent. I look at the paper. My name was already filled in under daughter. The date at the top is from week two. You planned this? I hoped for it. The 90 days wasn't a trial period for you. And what was it she met my eyes was for me to prove I could do it right, that I wouldn't give up when things got hard, that I'd choose you every single day, even when it cost me. I looked at that paper, at my name and her handwriting the word daughter. What if I mess up, I asked. Then we'll fix it together. I signed the paper. She put it in a frame and hung it in the hallway. Three years later, I graduated high school. She was in the front row. Last year, I finished my first year of college. She still text me every morning, still sends notes. The schedule still on my childhood bedroom door.

According to Jake, she kept casually asking mutual friends if I was doing okay, and seemed genuinely shocked that I'd actually left the country for real. Month three, my Japanese was finally good enough to have actual, real conversations beyond ordering food. That's when I met Yuki at a language exchange meet up in a tiny cafe tucked away in Harajuku. She was studying international business at Waseda University, spoke absolutely perfect English, and had this incredibly infectious laugh that made my chest feel tight. We started meeting twice a week to practice languages, but really, we were just falling head over heels for each other. One random Thursday morning, while Yuki and I were sharing convenience store coffee and those weird fluffy pancakes, my phone absolutely exploded with notification after notification. I made a huge mistake. I miss us so much it hurts. This break was the stupidest idea ever. Can you please come home? I need you back in my life. Then another message I saw Jake post about Japan on his story. Are you seriously teaching little kids now? This whole thing is ridiculous. And another answer me right now! We need to talk about this properly. You can't just ignore me forever! I screenshot all the messages and showed them to Yuki, who read through them carefully with raised eyebrows, then burst out laughing so hard she nearly spit out her coffee. Tell her you found someone who doesn't Need breaks to figure out what she wants, she said in perfect English, playfully stealing a bite of my pancake with her chopsticks. So I sent back exactly that. I found someone who doesn't need breaks to know what she wants. Hope you eventually find what you're looking for. Lisa's response came back within literally two minutes. Pan was always a completely stupid idea anyway. You're throwing your entire life away for some ridiculous fantasy that won't last. I showed Yuki the bitter message. She just smiled sweetly and said, should we tell her about our engagement party next month? We both started laughing so hard the convenience store clerk started giving us really weird looks. Definitely the best break of my entire life.

His reaction is priceless. I was turning 18 and honestly, I wasn't expecting much. My brother got a car for his 18th birthday. Not just any car, a brand new Jeep with a bow on top. My sister got a trip to Paris with two of her friends when she turned eighteen. Me dad pulled me aside exactly one week before my birthday and said, don't expect anything special this year. Money is tight. You know how it is. But I knew exactly how it was. Money wasn't tight. It was never tight when it came to them. Growing up, I always felt invisible in my own house. My brother was the golden child, star quarterback, straight A's, everyone's favorite. My sister was the baby princess who could do no wrong. And me, I was just there taking up space. I remember being 12 and winning a regional science fair. I came home so excited to tell everyone my brother had just scored a touchdown at practice. Same day. Guess which one got celebrated at dinner? Hint, it wasn't the science fair. When I was 15, I made honor roll for the first time. I left the certificate on the kitchen counter hoping someone would notice. Three days later, I found it under a pile of my sister's cheerleading flyers. No, no one had Said a word. So when dad gave me that warning about my birthday, something inside me shifted. I wasn't hurt anymore. I was done. I've been working at a local grocery store since I was 16. Every paycheck I put away as much as I could. I told my parents the money was for college expenses, which wasn't exactly a lie. But I had a bigger plan brewing. Six months before my 18th birthday, I'd applied to MIT. I didn't tell anyone, not my guidance counselor, not my friends, definitely not my family. I wrote the essays late at night in my room. I sent in my test scores, my transcripts, everything in secret. Three months before my birthday, I got the email, full academic scholarship, full ride. They wanted me. I stared at that acceptance letter for hours, reading it over and over, making sure it was real. And then I saved it. I didn't tell a soul. I wanted to wait for the perfect moment. My birthday morning arrived. I came downstairs around 9:00am. Mom was making pancakes, but they were my sister's favorite kind, chocolate chip. My birthday breakfast had always been blueberry, but I guess she forgot. Dad was reading the newspaper. My brother was texting someone, probably his girlfriend. My sister was taking selfies with the pancakes before she even ate them. Morning, I said, sitting down at the table, oh, happy birthday, sweetie, mom said. Not looking up from the stove. Dad glanced at Me over his newspaper and gave a single nod that.

So I was married to Ben for 18 years before I finally got tired of his crap and filed for divorce. This guy was the worst kind of husband. The type who thinks screaming at you about burnt toast means he's communicating. He tear me down every single day with his mouth, calling me useless, stupid, you name it. The final straw was when he told me I was lucky he married me because nobody else would want damaged goods like me. After the divorce papers were signed, Ben packed his stuff and moved four hours away to live near his mom. Perfect. Good riddance. Here's the thing. He also decided our three kids weren't worth the drive anymore. Child support barely covered groceries, visits, maybe Christmas if we were lucky. I was basically a single mom overnight while this deadbeat played video games in his childhood bedroom. About six months later, I decided we needed new family photos. The old ones still had Ben's smug face in them, and every time I walked past our hallway, I wanted to punch the wall. I booked us a session at one of those Fancy Portrait studios downtown. My kids were excited. They'd grown so much since the divorce. And honestly, we all looked happier without Ben's negativity dragging us down. We spent the afternoon taking different poses. The photographer was this sweet older lady who kept making my youngest laugh by making funny Faces behind the camera. When we finished, she. She showed us the digital gallery on her computer. The photos were beautiful. Genuine smiles, relaxed poses. None of that forced family nonsense we used to do. As we're scrolling through, picking which ones to order, my oldest daughter, Emma, suddenly perks up. Mom, can we send one to Grandma Ruth? That's Ben's mom. I felt my stomach drop a little because Ruth and I never really had much of a relationship. We saw each other maybe twice a year at holidays. Change pleasantries. That was it. Honey, I don't think grandma would want a picture with me in it, I told her gently. But we can definitely order her a nice one with just you kids. Emma shook her head really fast. No, mom. She always asks about you when dad calls. She tells him he messed up the best thing that ever happened.

My uncle had passed away after battling cancer for five years. Today was the will reading of his estate. In the ordinance with this final will and testimony, you are allotted $3 million in the beach house in Beverly Hills. Greg, you are also allotted $3 million in the little ranch in Texas. My siblings were sitting there like proud peacocks as they heard what Uncle Tim had left them. Jacob, you are given the dinner in Florida along with the condo there. My siblings instantly burst into laughter. Little Jacob still has to work for his money. So sad that you can't borrow my millions, Greg taunted viciously. Don't worry, Jacob, I'm sure you will find ways to make money. Working hard and all that, Chrissy stated with an evil smirk as she waved her hand at me. I couldn't help but scowl at Chrissy and Greg. I would have been happier if Uncle Tim was still alive, but I kept my mouth shut. This concludes the reading and distribution of your uncle's estate. Finally, I can take a vacation. Chrissy fly wanted. I stood up and snapped at the pair. I bet you lose everything Uncle Tim gave you both in under a month. I slammed the door on my way out. Uncle Tim and I used to always get together at his diner. We could talk for hours about our lives. His stories and even our dreams. I just want to provide for my family and myself, I told Uncle Tim One day. He stared at me for a few minutes before I started shifting nervously. You're not like your siblings, Jacob. You see your worth in providing. They only see their worth connected to what they have. When the day comes, I hope you are pleased if I give you the diner. My mouth drops open in shock as he not only validated my feelings on the matter, dissed my siblings, but also promised me legacy. I.

No, I'm leaving because you're apartment hunting with your ex and calling me controlling. When I asked about it, it was just hypothetical. We were just looking. Then why didn't you tell me? She had no answer. I called my brother Jake. He had a spare room and didn't ask questions. Took me 40 minutes to pack everything that mattered, clothes, laptop, PlayStation, important documents. I left my key on the kitchen counter. As I was loading the last box into my car, she came outside. Her confidence was gone. Where are you going? We need to talk about this like adults. You can't just leave. Watch me. I got in my car and drove off. She called 11 times that night. I didn't answer. Day two, the text start coming. Noah, this is ridiculous. You're overreacting. It's not what you think. Day three, your tone changed. The electricity Bill is due. Are you going to pay your half? I've been covering about 70% of our expenses because I made more. Rent was one 800 dollars. I paid one 300 dollars. She paid $500. I responded once. I'm respecting your independence. You've got this. By day five, she showed up at Jake's apartment. I don't know how she found out where I Was maybe she called my mom. Jake's girlfriend Rachel answered the door and immediately called for me. Olivia looked destroyed, hair unwashed, eyes puffy, wearing the same hoodie from three days ago. Noah, please, can we talk? You took it too far. It was just a. What about the apartment hunting? That wasn't real. We were just browsing. Marcus was helping me understand my options. Options for what? For if you ever left me, I needed a safety net. So you were preparing to leave while I was preparing our future. Got it. She started crying harder. The least Marcus and I looked at fell through. His credit score is 5, 10. They won't let him co sign. I can't afford our place alone. I need you. And there it was. Not I love you, not I made a mistake. Just I need you. Sounds like you should have thought about that before tweeting about your rights. Closed the door. I heard her crying in the hallway for 10 minutes before Jake threatened to call the cops if she didn't leave. She's been staying with her mom ever since. Marcus stopped commenting on her posts exactly three days after the lease fell through. Guess his interest in helping her move had conditions attached.

We've been together 18 months, living together for the last 6. I thought we were solid. Then Marcus started appearing everywhere. First it was likes on her Instagram Story, send comments and the DM started around 6 weeks to go. I'm not the jealous type. I've got female friends, she's got male friends. We're adults. But when I woke up at 3:00am to get water and found her on the couch in the dark smiling at her phone with that soft she used to give me, something felt wrong. Who's texting you this late, I asked. She jumped like I'd caught her stealing. Just Sarah girl drama. Then she locked her phone and went to bed. But I'd seen the name at the top, Marcus. I didn't bring it up. Two weeks went by. The texting got worse. She'd be on her phone during dinner, during movies. Once we were literally mid conversation about her mom's birthday plan. Every time I glanced over, she tilt the screen away. Then came the laptop incident. I needed to print my resume for a job interview. Her MacBook was closer than mine. I opened it and her messages app was still logged in. The notification popped up right as I was about to print. Marcus, can't wait to see the place tomorrow. Think you'll love the balcony view. My stomach dropped. I just stared at it. What place? We had a place together. When she got home from work that evening, I was calm. I had 6 hours to think about it. Hey, I saw a message from Marcus up on your laptop. Something about seeing a place tomorrow. Her face went completely white, then red. Then she grabbed her phone from her purse like it was a weapon. You went through my messages. That's a huge violation of privacy. They literally just appeared while I was printing. What place is he talking about? She started pacing. This is exactly why I need options. You're so controlling, always questioning who I talk to. Options. What does that mean? I'm allowed to look at apartments if I want. I'm allowed to have a backup plan. What if this doesn't work out? I need to know I have somewhere to go. My chest felt height. Are you planning to leave? She didn't answer, just stared at me with this find expression. Then she did something I'll never forget. She pulled out her phone, typed for about 30 seconds and showed me her screen before posting it. The tweet read, I'm not property. I'm a person with rights. No one gets to control who I talk to or what I do with my life, my body. My choice. Then she hit post. Within minutes, her friends were in the comments. You deserve better, girl. That's toxic masculinity. Run, sis. I sat there for maybe 5 minutes just watching the likes roll in. Then I opened Twitter, screenshot her tweet and, quote, retweeted it with respect.

Fifteen years later, they mocked me, asking about the boy they left to die until he walked in a grown man. Their faces were priceless. I came home from work exhausted, ready to crash on the couch. Instead, I found my six year old nephew Tyler curled up on the recliner clutching a crumpled note with tears streaming down his face. Uncle Dan, he sniff fold. Aunt Rachel and Uncle Brad said they're sorry. My stomach dropped. I grabbed the note from his tiny hands. It was written in Rachel's neat, dramatic handwriting. It said, Dan, Brad and I are in love. We can't fight it anymore. Please take care of Tyler for now. Don't try to find us. My wife, my brother, gone together. But here's the part that really broke me. Tyler wasn't even my kid. He was Rachel's sister Amy's son. Amy had been crying about Tyler's terminal blood disorder for months. Rachel was always fussing over his medication, organizing fundraisers, putting on this whole tragic performance, except it was all lies. Three days after they abandoned him, I took Tyler to a real doctor. Doctor Stevens ran tests and then called me into her office with a grim expression. Mister Harrison, she said quietly, Tyler does not have a blood disorder. He is severely malnourished. He has been starving. It felt like someone punched me in the chest. The medicine Rachel had been giving Him relabeled vitamins. The hospital visits, five days. For Amy, the entire illness had been a scam to get sympathy and donations while they neglected this child. I was furious and heartbroken, but I had a choice to make. I could track down Rachel and Brad or I could focus on Tyler. I chose Tyler.

Brad lost his business. Their marriage imploded when a DNA test proved their daughter wasn't even his. Then one Saturday, I ran into them at the grocery store. Rachel looked older and worn down. Brad had gained weight and looked miserable. They both froze when they saw me. Dan, Rachel said nervously. How have you been? Great, I said coldly. Still have both kidneys, so, yeah, doing fantastic. Brad forced to laugh. So whatever happened to that kid, Tyler, right? Didn't think you'd keep him long? A wave of anger went through me. He's doing better than both of you combined, Rachel smirked. Come on, Dan, you're acting like you're some kind of hero. You got stuck raising someone else's problem child. Problem child, I said quietly. That problem child is graduating law school next month. They both blinked, totally stunned. Before they could respond, I heard a familiar voice behind me. Dad, you ready? I turned around and saw Tyler, tall, confident, wearing a sharp suit. He looked like success made human. Rachel's face went white. Tyler, he looked at her with calm, cold eyes. Yeah, the kid you left to die, Brad stammered. We, we were young. You were selfish, Tyler said evenly. There's a difference. You taught me what love isn't. He taught me what love is. He pointed at me. Rachel's eyes filled with tear.

And now you're keeping him quiet. I pulled out my phone with photos of Dad's medication logs. The morphine increases. Walk me through them. She glanced at the pages. Hospice doctor approved every increase. But you requested them based on Dad's pain levels. I was there two days before he died. He wasn't in severe pain. Pain can be internal. You're not a medical professional. Neither was the hospice doctor who only saw him twice. You were the one reporting his condition. Kevin stirred, struggling to speak through the medication fog. She told me, told me dad asked her to, to help him go faster. Nicole's face went white. Kevin, don't. Did dad ask you to speed things up? I asked. Silence. Her voice cold and defensive. Your father was in agony. He begged me to help him. I did what any compassionate nurse would do. You euthanized him. I eased his suffering. He had weeks of pain ahead and he didn't want to live through it. Did he actually ask you or did you decide for him? He couldn't speak clearly anymore, but I knew what he wanted. Kevin was crying now. She told me after said dad wanted it made me promise not to tell anyone. But I couldn't stop thinking about whether it was true. My mom's voice came. From the doorway. Richard never asked for that. We all turned. Mom's face was pale. I was with him every day. He talked about fighting, about seeing Kevin's kids someday. He never asked you to kill him. Nicole's composure shattered. He would have if he could have seen how bad it would get. I prevented suffering that hadn't happened yet. You prevented him from saying goodbye, from having three more months with his family. My hands shook as I called 9, 1, 1. Nicole didn't try to run, just kept saying, I helped him, like she was trying to convince herself. Nicole was charged with second degree murder and Kevin is in therapy, working through the guilt of keeping her secret and the fog she kept him in with medication he didn't need. I'm grateful Kevin used our signal even when he wasn't sure why, even when Nicole tried to keep him quiet.

It felt like being punched. I pulled out my phone. I need to show you something. First came the missing person reports. I'd filed eight of them. His forehead wrinkled. You called the police. That gave me hope. Then receipts from searching that totaled $80,000. His anger started cracking. Why couldn't you find us? I explained the name changes, cash payments, fake profiles. Come to my house. There's more, I said. He followed in his car. That 20 minute drive felt endless. I kept thinking he might turn around and leave. I let him upstairs and opened his old bedroom door. He froze seeing the Dinosaur walls. You kept my room. His voice cracked. Then he saw the closet boxes labeled by year. He opened 9th birthday, found a card saying happy birthday, buddy. Dad loves you. And I'm still looking. He started opening more boxes. 10 years of cards and wrapped presents. Tears filled his eyes. She said you forgot about me, he whispered. I showed him bank statements with every payment highlighted, $144,000 total. His face turned pale. We lived in roach infested apartments. I wore shoes with holes. Then his eyes went wide. Wait, my mother's parents gave mom cash envelopes every month. Said it was to help out. He looked at me. That was my child support, wasn't it? I nodded. Call your mom. Ask where my money went. He called her right then and put it on speaker Where are you? She screamed. Immediately with dad, he said. The line went silent and then she started yelling, get out of there. He's dangerous. Call the police right now. And I could hear the panic in her voice. Mom, I saw everything, including the missing person reports and the cards, he said calmly. He's manipulating you, she screamed back. Where did the money go? He asked her directly. What money? He never sent anything, she lied. I saw the bank statement showing $144,000 and grandma gave you cash every month. That was actually my money, wasn't it, he said. She went quiet and then her breathing got heavy. You don't understand what I went through, she finally said. That money was for me and you stole it, he shouted at her. I did what I had to do, she admitted. You lied to me for 10 years and stole from me and kept me from my dad, he yelled, I protected you. She screamed back, from what exactly? From letters from a father who spent everything trying to find me, he demanded. She started sobbing and making excuses and blaming me for everything. Her parents helped you steal my child support, he said coldly. Don't you dare bring them into this, she shrieked. I'm done with all of you, he said, and hung up. He looked at me with tears in his eyes and asked, can I live with you? Six months later, he still lives here and we Painted his room green together. She's facing fraud charges now. Her parents were arrested yesterday as a.

Then he turned 18 and knocked on my door. I hadn't seen my son in 10 years. Not by choice. When he was 8, my ex wife Denise took him and vanished while I was at work. One day I was tucking him into bed. The next day his room was empty. She changed their names, moved states away and told everyone I'd abandoned them. For 10 years I've been the deadbeat dad who walked out on his family. That's what she told him. That's what she told her new husband. That's what she told anyone who'd listen. Meanwhile, I spent $80,000 trying to find them. Hired lawyers who couldn't track them, filed police reports that went nowhere. The court still made me pay 12 monthly to her parents address. Forwarded it to her secretly while telling police they didn't know where she was. I kept his bedroom exactly the same. Dinosaur wallpaper, toy cars on the shelf, his favorite book on the nightstand. Every birthday and Christmas, I sent cards and presents to that address. Her parents returned them all unopened. I kept them in boxes in his closet. Ten years of returned love. 10 years of searching. 10 years of being called a deadbeat while paying support for a son I couldn't find. Three weeks after his 18th birthday, I got a Facebook message that made my hands shake. It just said, are you my dad? And I knew it. Was him. He remembered my real name from when he was little. We messaged for hours, and everything he said hurt to read. He thought I'd walked out when he was eight. Never looked back. Never. Percent money while his mom worked three jobs. Chose my career over being his father. I begged him to meet me for coffee. He almost said no, but finally agreed. When he walked into that coffee shop, I couldn't believe how much he looked like me. Same eyes, same nervous finger tapping when upset. But his face was full of anger. Mom said you

Sleep on the couch tonight. She's never actually said the words out loud. She just gives me the look. And I know it's like our unspoken rule. The look means couch. No discussion. I stood there for a second, then grab my pillow from the bedroom. But here's the thing. We have a guest bedroom right down the hall with a full size bed. I've always thought the whole couch punishment was ridiculous when we have a perfectly good spare room. So this time I walked past the living room and went straight to the guest room instead. I figured same concept, different location. I'm still sleeping separately like she wanted. I'm still being punished. Just on an actual mattress instead of our cramped couch. Made sense to me. The guest bed is actually more comfortable than ours. I slept great. At 6:00am, she opened the guest room door and just stood there in the doorway. Her arms were crossed. Why are you in here? I was half asleep and confused. What do you mean? You gave me the face. I'm sleeping separately. She walked over and sat on the edge of the bed. That's not how this works. The face means couch, not guest room couch. There's a difference. I sat up. What difference? I'm still not in our bed. I'm still being punished. This just has better back support. She shook her head. The couch is uncomfortable. On purpose. That's the entire point. You're supposed to feel it. The guest room is too comfortable. You're just finding a way around the actual punishment. I told her that made no sense. If the point is sleeping separately, then I'm doing exactly that. The location shouldn't matter. Wrong thing to say. She stood up. This stopped being about the cake the second you decided to ignore what the face means. You know exactly what it means. We've had this system for years. You're being difficult on purpose. I asked her why we even have the face system if she's just going to get more mad when I follow it. She walked out without answering and slammed the door so hard a picture frame fell off the wall. It's been 5 days now. Complete Cold War. She makes her own dinner, eats in the bedroom with the door locked, leaves for work early so we don't have to drive together. Yesterday her sister called me saying, I need to just apologize already and stop making a huge deal over something small. I'm the one who ate some old cake and somehow I'm still the bad guy. My coworker said his wife does the exact same couch thing and he just sleeps there every time to avoid the fight.

My brother Kevin and I made a pact when we were teenagers. The kind of dark humor only siblings share. We were watching our dad mow the lawn on Saturday afternoon when Kevin said, when I die, I want them to play Celebration at my funeral. Really confuse everyone. Then he got serious. Actually, if any of us ever play Celebration at a funeral, it means something's really wrong. Like, emergency level wrong. I asked why we need a signal like that, and he shrugged. Weird things happen. If you hear that song at a funeral, you'll know someone needs help. We shook on it and never brought it up again. Twenty years later, dad collapsed at work and got diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. The doctors gave him three months, maybe four. Kevin's wife, Nicole, was a hospice nurse, and when she offered to coordinate Dad's care, my parents were relieved. Nicole set up the hospital bed, created medication schedules, and helped my parents understand the medical terminology. I lived two states away and could only visit on weekends, so knowing Nicole was handling everything gave me peace of mind. Dad was still himself at first, still cracking jokes and insisting he'd beat this. And the pain got worse, and the morphine increased. Dad started sleeping more, fading in and out. Nicole said this was Normal progression. When dad died six weeks after diagnosis, we were heartbroken but not surprised. The doctor said, sometimes it happens faster than expected. At the funeral home, when the director asked about music, Kevin stared at the table for a long moment before saying quietly, for the closing song, I want Celebration by cool and the gang. My heart stopped. Nicole touched his shoulder gently. Honey, maybe something more traditional. Your father loved classical music. Kevin blinked like he was coming out of a fog. Yeah, you're right. Whatever you think. But I'd already heard it. The signal. I caught him alone afterward. Why did you request that

Last Tuesday Around eight PM, I ate the leftover birthday cake without asking. It was from her work party three days earlier. Her team celebrated her 32nd birthday with this fancy chocolate cake from an expensive bakery. He brought home two slices in a container by Tuesday. I got home from LA Fitness around eight PM starving. She was at book club until ten PM. I saw the cake in the fridge. Three days seemed like pushing it. It would go bad soon. I grabbed both slices, heated them 15 seconds in the microwave and ate them at the counter watching NBA highlights on my phone. Pretty good. Not amazing for what fancy bakeries charge, but decent. I washed the container, put it in the dishwasher, didn't think about it again. She got home around ten thirty PM and went straight to the kitchen. She grabs a snack after book club every week. Same routine. I was on the couch scrolling my phone when I heard the bridge open, close, open again. Then her voice sharp did you eat my birthday cake? Both pieces I walked in. Yeah, I ate it after the gym. It was sitting there three days. I figured you forgot about it. Her face went red. That was my birthday cake from my party. I was saving it. I tried explaining. She never mentioned saving it. That three days is a long time. That I genuinely thought She forgot. She cut me off. I don't care what you thought. You ate both slices without even asking? That's selfish. I pointed out she eats my food all the time. Last Thursday, she finished my beef jerky I bought for work lunches. Week before that, she ate my last bagel for breakfast. Never asks first. She crossed her arms. That's different. Those are groceries. This was my birthday. It was special. I honestly didn't think birthday cake three days later was that big of a deal. I said that. Wrong move. She went completely silent. Just stared at me with this specific look on her face. I knew that look.

My daughter Mia has this thing where she remembers every person she's ever met, every single one. It's actually kind of terrifying. Last month at the grocery store, she recognized our mailman from two years ago who'd been transferred to a different route. The guy didn't even remember us. So when my sister Claire brought her fiance Ryan to Thanksgiving dinner for the first time, I made me a promise to be on her best behavior. Claire had been dating Ryan for eight months and this was the big family introduction. My parents were already planning the wedding in their heads. Ryan seemed perfect on paper. He worked as a financial advisor, drove a clean Lexus and brought expensive wine that my dad actually approved of. He complimented my mom's green bean casserole, laughed at my dad's terrible jokes and even offered to help set the table. He's a keeper, my mom whispered to Claire in the kitchen loud enough for everyone to hear. Everything was going smoothly. We were all sitting around the table passing dishes when Mia asked if she could show everyone her new drawing app. I said yes, grateful she was being so well behaved. That's when Ryan got up to grab more Turkey from the kitchen. Mia followed him, tablet in hand. I didn't think anything of it until I heard her voice. Clear and curious in that way only six year olds can manage. I know you. I glanced over. Ryan was frozen at the counter serving spoon midair. He laughed, but it sounded forced. I don't think so, sweetheart. This is my first time meeting you. Mia tilted her head studying him. No, I've seen you before. You came to my friend Olivia's apartment. The serving spoon clattered against the dish. Sweetie, I think you're mixing me up with someone else, Ryan said, his voice getting tighter. But Mia wasn't backing down. She never does when she knows she's right. No, it was definitely you. You brought flowers, pink ones, and you kiss Olivia's mom's tummy and said you couldn't wait to meet the baby. The entire dining room went silent. Even my dad stopped chewing. Ryan's face drained of all color. Mia, honey, I really think you're confused. I'm not confused, Mia said, pulling up her tablet. Olivia's mom showed me pictures. She said you were gonna be the baby's daddy. She has them on her fridge. She turned.

Sir, step aside. Three agents in uniform were blocking the gate. One held up two passports, both with my photo but different names. That's not mine, I said, pointing to the second one. Then why was it in your carry on? My stomach dropped. I opened my bag. There it was. Same photo, different name. Marcus Webb. My real name is David Chen. They escorted me to a back room. The walls were grey, no windows, just a metal table and three chairs. Sit down. We're running your fingerprints. I sat there for an hour watching the clock. My connecting flight was leaving. My phone kept buzzing with text from my mom asking where I was. Finally, an older agent walked in with a folder. He didn't sit, just stood there staring at me. Your prints match both passports. That's impossible. He opened the folder. Six months ago, someone using the name Marcus Webb applied for a passport at a Chicago office. Used your photo, your fingerprints. I've never been to Chicago. He pulled out a paper. Marcus Webb has three active warrants, identity fraud, check fraud, drug possession. My hands went cold. I don't do drugs. I work in I t. I've never even gotten a speeding ticket. Then explain this. He slid another paper across the table. Bank statement, Marcus Webb's account deposits totaling $47,000 over the past six months. I don't have that kind of money. Marcus Webb does. According to our records. You are Marcus Webb. I stared at the ceiling trying to think. Then it hit me. My ex girlfriend's brother. He works at the DMV. The agent raised an eyebrow. Keep talking. We dated for two years, broke up last October. It was bad. She kept showing up at my apartment, calling me at 3:00am, telling me I'd regret leaving her. I took a breath. Her brother, Jake, he processes ID applications. He always acted weird around me, like he hated me for dating his Mister. You think he did this? After we broke up, she told me Jake would make me pay. I thought she was just being dramatic. The agent wrote something down, then he left the room. 20 minutes past and 40. I kept checking.

When she contacted her lawyer the next day, she dropped her phone in shock. I'm Ryan, and I'm an architect in Charleston. Last Tuesday, I got an email from my wife, Emma, while she was supposedly at a meditation retreat in Colorado. The subject line was blank. The message said, I found someone worth my time. I've moved your inheritance into my personal account. It's better this way. There was a photo attached. Her and some bearded guy on a hotel balcony, wine glasses raised, both smiling. She looked happier than she'd been with me in years. The inheritance was $620,000 from my uncle, who raised me after my parents died. He worked two jobs to put me through school. That money meant everything. I stared at the email for maybe 10 minutes. I typed six words. Thanks for letting me know. Closed my laptop, went to bed. Here's what Emma didn't know. Three months earlier, our neighbour mentioned seeing a strange car dropping Emma off late one night while I was at a conference. Then my financial advisor called saying someone tried accessing my trust accounts using my information, but couldn't pass security questions. That same week, Emma suggested, we can solidate all our accounts to make things simpler. I smiled and said, I'd think About it. The next day, I drove to meet my uncle's lawyer, Rita. I explained everything calmly. She reminded me the inheritance was in an irrevocable trust, legally impossible for anyone but me to touch. We set up monitoring to track any access attempts. Then I checked our shared cloud storage. Emma had left a folder called Home Projects that contained screenshots of my account statements, transfer protocols, and notes calculating transfer fees.

He was smiling in that proud, loving way you can't fake. The photo was dated three weeks ago. My sister stood up so fast, her chair scraped against the floor. She grabbed the tablet from Mia's hands. For a moment, nobody moved. Nobody breathed. Then Claire started scrolling, her finger shaking on the screen. More photos loaded. Ryan and this woman at what looked like a doctor's office, his hand holding hers. Ryan painting a nursery, pale yellow. Ryan holding a tiny onesie that said baddies girl, with the biggest smile on his face. Ryan kissing this woman's forehead in a grocery store parking lot. Who the hell is Olivia? Claire's voice cracked. Ryan opened his mouth, closed it, opened it again. Claire, I can explain. Explain what? My mom's voice was. Ice. Explain why there's a pregnant woman with pictures of you acting like her baby's father. It's complicated, Ryan stammered, reaching for Claire's arm. She jerked away. Complicated? You're engaged to me. You're supposed to get married in April. Wait. My dad stood up, his face Red. April? Isn't that when the baby's supposed to be born? Ryan's silence was the loudest sound in the room. Mia, oblivious to the chaos she caused, woke up again. Olivia said the baby's coming in March. Her mom has a countdown calendar on the wall. Claire scrolled Faster through the tablet, her breathing getting quicker. She stopped on a photo that made her entire body go rigid. This was taken at the same restaurant we went to for our sixth month anniversary. Her voice was barely a whisper. You told me you had a work dinner that night. Ryan finally started crying. Not sad crying, panic, desperate crying. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I never meant for this to happen. I love you both, both. Claire looked up from the tablet, her face length with shock. That's when my mom grabbed her phone. What's this? Olivia's mother's name. I'm calling her right now. Ryan's face somehow got even paler. Don't. Please don't. Why not? My dad demanded. Ryan swallowed hard, looked at Claire, looked at all of us because he whispered, she thinks she's my fiance too. Rest of the story is linked below and on my channel.

Now when he came back, he had another agent with him, a woman in a suit. We pulled d m. V. Records. She said Jake Martinez accessed your file four times after your breakup. Twice more than any legitimate reason would require. So you believe me? She didn't answer. Then she pulled out her phone. We found this. It was a photo, me and my ex at some restaurant, but I'd never been to that restaurant. I leaned closer. The lighting was wrong. My shirt looked photoshopped. Where did you get that? Marcus Webb's apartment in Chicago. We executed a search warrant an hour ago. My throat tightened. Someone's living as me in Chicago. Not just living, working, collecting paychecks, opening bank accounts. She swipe to another photo. We found 12 fake IDS, all using variations of your identity. Who's doing this? She looked at the older agent. They shared a glance. We don't know yet. But here's what we do know. Jake Martinez quit his DMV job three weeks ago. No forwarding address, phones disconnected. And your ex girlfriend. She paused. She filed a missing person's report on him yesterday. The room felt smaller. What does that mean? It means, the older agent said sitting down across from me. Either Jake is running from something or someone got him first. Someone who? Neither of them answered. The woman pulled out a card. We need you to stay in town for the next 72 hours. Don't leave the state. We'll be in touch. Wait, that's it. I'm not under arrest. Not yet, the older agent said, but Marcus Webb is. And until we figure out who he really is, shut up. You're the only lead we have. They let me go. But as I walked out of that airport, I kept thinking about what the agent said. Someone got to him first. I checked into a hotel that night, couldn't sleep, just kept staring at my passport, my real one. Then my phone buzzed. Unknown number. The text said, stop looking into this. Jake. Made a mistake. Don't make the same one. I stared at it for 10 minutes before calling the agent back. It went straight to voicemail. Rest of the story is linked below and on my channel.

I'm 54 and I've been married to Diana for 27 years. Last Tuesday, I came home after fixing the shed out back. I walked into the kitchen with grease on my hands and a wrench still in my pocket. That's when Diana exploded. Get out, she screamed, not once but three times, each one louder than the last. Before I could even respond, he grabbed my duffle bag from the closet and started throwing my things onto the front lawn, shirts, socks, even my toothbrush. Everything landed in the wet grass. The neighbors were watching from their windows. I just stood there in my work boots watching my life scatter across the yard. Here's the thing, though. Diana wasn't crying or emotional. She was calm, almost cold, like she had rehearsed this moment. Her wedding ring wasn't even on her finger anymore. I want a real life Raymond, she said, not this boring existence with you. I didn't argue. I didn't beg. I just bent down, picked up my things and walked to my truck. As I drove away, I saw her watching me through the window. She was making sure I didn't come back. What Diana never knew was that two years ago I transferred everything into a trust, the house, the cars, the bank accounts, every bit of it. I did it quietly while she was at one of her weekend wellness retreats. He Never asked where I was or what I was doing. She didn't ask much about anything anymore. See, I'm a mechanic. I fix things. And over the years, I'd watch too many men lose everything because they trusted that love would protect them legally. That night, from my uncle's cabin in the woods, I made two phone calls, one to my lawyer, one to my account.

Every utility was transferred. The house deed, something Diana thought she was on, was listed under the trust, only her name was never there. A week passed. I stayed silent. I didn't call. I didn't text. Then I saw her Instagram. She was at a luxury spa with her sister holding champagne, posting captions like, finally free the Bill for the trip charged to our joint card. That's when I cut off her access entirely. Three days later, my son Brendan called me. Dad, mom says you're trying to steal the house. What's going on? Ask her to show you the house title, I said. The next call wasn't a call. It was Diana at the cabin door. She looked like she hadn't slept in days. No makeup, hair messy, eyes red and swollen. Why are you doing this to me? She yelled. You made your choice. I said, I'm just handling it legally. You blindsided me. No, I replied. You threw my life onto the lawn. I just picked it up. She opened her mouth to say more, but I stepped inside and quietly closed the door. No shouting, no drama, just a soft click. This morning, Diana received the final papers. The house sold last week. The money is now locked in a trust for our future grandkids. The post nuptual agreement she signed six years ago, the one she skimmed because she was rushing to brunch, confirm. She waved all rights. To anything I owned. My lawyer says it's airtight. My accountant says it's brilliant. Diana texted Brendan, he's really not coming back, is he? And she's right, I'm not. Because the truth is, I never shouted when I was angry. I planned. And when someone shows you who they really are, you don't fight back with noise. You respond with paperwork.

These were words I'd never heard from her before. Her friends started acting weird around me, too. At a group dinner, her roommate Jessica kept giving me these looks, like she felt sorry for me. When I asked what was going on, she said I should talk to Emma. But every time I tried, Emma would def. Actors say I was being paranoid. Kyle's behavior got stranger. He'd text me, asking to hang out one on one, which he'd never done before. When we met for coffee, he'd ask questions about my work schedule, when I'd be home, whether I lived alone. The questions felt off somehow, too specific. But I couldn't figure out why. Emma broke up with me on a Thursday. She said she needed time to focus on herself, that our relationship had become unhealthy. I asked what changed, and she said Kyle had helped her see things clearly. She said he pointed out patterns of controlling behavior. I didn't even know I was exhibit. The accusations came rapid fire. Things I'd supposedly said or done that I had no memory of. I tried to argue, but she wouldn't listen. She said Kyle had been there for her when I wasn't, that he understood her better than I did. The way she said his name had this defensive quality, like she was protecting him from criticism. Two weeks later, I smelled smoke at 2:00am. I ran downstairs and found my kitchen on fire. Small flames spreading from a pile of rags. So in something that smelled like gasoline, I grabbed my fire extinguisher and put it out before calling 911. The fire inspector found evidence of forced entry through my back door. Three days after that, Kyle showed up at my house. He was agitated, pacing on my porch, demanding I stay away from Emma. I said I hadn't contacted her since the breakup. He didn't believe me, said Emma had told him I'd been harassing her. I pulled out my phone to show him there were no calls or texts, and that's when he lunged at me. The security camera footage showed everything. And what the police found on his phone revealed the truth about what he'd really been doing for months. The rest of the story is on my channel or linked below.

He should have asked you out. You two would have made more sense. I stopped folding napkins. What? Well, you and Jace have more in common. Kevin, so quiet. Jace is more your speed. She smiled like she'd given me a compliment. Later that night, we were all in the living room. Kevin and I were on the couch. Jace and Diana were across from us. His parents were in their recliners working on their second bottle of wine. That's when his mom said it, the thing that made me snap. Jace, why don't you sneak into their bedroom tonight? She giggled. I bet she won't even notice. Just to see. I stood up. My whole body was shaking. Stop. The room went quiet. His mom blinked at me. What? Stop right now. I'm serious. This needs to stop. She waved her hand dismissively. Oh, honey, it's just a joke. You're being too sensitive. A joke? My voice cracked. You've been suggesting your son violate my consent for three years. You've been implying I'm too stupid to recognize my own husband. You've been disrespecting our marriage since the day he got engaged. How is any of that money? His dad leaned forward. Now, wait a minute. No. Jace stood up next to Me? She's right. It's disgusting. I've asked you to stop 100 times. We all have. Kevin stood to, his jaw clenched. We've told you this makes us uncomfortable, all three of us, multiple times. And you keep doing it because you think it's hilarious. His mom's face turned red. We're just joking about how close you all are, how similar Jace and his wife. I mean, you stop calling me Jace's anything. I said I'm Kevin's wife. I chose Kevin. I married Kevin. And if you can't respect that, we won't be coming back. Anna, who'd been silent this whole time, added quietly. It's made me uncomfortable, too, every time we're here. His mom stood up angry. Now you're all overreacting. It's a compliment. I'm saying you're all so close. You're saying I can't tell my husband apart from another man. I interrupted. You're saying Jay should violate my consent. You're saying our marriage is some kind of mistake. None of that is a compliment. Kevin grabbed my hand. We're leaving and we're not coming back until you apologize and actually understand why this is wrong. We left. Jace and Diana followed us out in the driveway. Jace hugged me. I'm sorry. I should have stood up harder, sooner. It's not your fault, I said. That was two months ago. We haven't been back. His parents sent a text last week saying we were ruining the family over nothing. Kevin blocked their number. So did Jace.

Instead, Lisa just stopped talking to faith completely, like they live in the same house, but she pretends faith doesn't exist. If faith walks into a room, Lisa walks out. If faith says hi, Lisa ignores her. It's been awkward for months, but I figured they'd eventually work it out as adults. Two nights ago, Lisa and I got into a huge argument. That's when she admitted the truth. She told me she hated faith, not that she was frustrated or annoyed, but that she actually hated her. She called faith a bunch of nasty names I won't repeat. Then she said she refused to go to any family gatherings or holidays if faith was going to be there, Christmas, Thanksgiving, birthdays, nothing, because she couldn't stand being in the same room as my daughter. I was stunned. I knew things were bad, but I had no idea she felt that way. As soon as we got home, I went straight upstairs to my computer and printed out divorce papers. I filled everything out, left them on the kitchen table and told Lisa I'd be filing this week. All our money has always been separate and I pay for basically everything anyway, so it should be quick and clean. This morning, Lisa texted me saying she didn't want a divorce and that I was overreacting. She said I was being dramatic over one argument. I reminded her that A year ago, I told her exactly what would happen if she didn't get help or learn to manage her anger. I said I've always been a person of my word, so I don't know why she thought I was joking. She called me an asshole and said I was probably planning this all along, that I wanted an excuse to leave her. But that's not true at all. I love Lisa, or at least I love the person she was before all this. She's making me choose between her and my kid, and that's not even a choice. Even when faith moves out in a few months to be closer to her new school, I know this problem won't just disappear. Now Lisa's telling her family that I'm abandoning her over nothing and that I'm a horrible husband.

Even if they stay married, it all goes to her and the kids only. My sister in law laughs, mom, you're brilliant. He's been mooching long enough. For context, I'm a civil engineer.

Mira doesn't need to know about, about what I interrupted, about how her own mother has spent two and a/2 decades disrespecting her husband in a language she thought I couldn't understand, about how you've been planning to manipulate your inheritance to make sure I know my place behind them. I saw Mira walk into the kitchen in doorway. From the look on her face, she'd heard at least the last part. How long, she asked me quietly, since the engagement dinner.

Kevin showed up an hour later covered in grease from working on a 67 Mustang. We talked for three hours straight. Jace just smiled the whole time, clearly proud of his matchmaking skills. Four years later, Kevin and I got married. Jace was the best man. Everything was perfect until the rehearsal day. That's when it started. Kevin's mom stood up to give a toast and halfway through she looked at Jace and said, you know, you could just switch places tomorrow and she'd never know the difference. The room laughed nervously. I forced to smile. Kevin squeezed my hand under the table so hard it hurt. I thought it was a one time thing, wedding jitters maybe, but it wasn't. At our first Christmas as a married couple, his dad cornered Jace in the kitchen while I was grabbing wine. You should sneak into their room tonight, he said, loud enough for me to hear. Let's see if she notices. Jace's face went red. He told His dad to stop. His dad just laughed and walked away. Every family gathering, same joke. Easter dinner, his mom said, Jace, sit next to her, see if she realizes it's not Kevin. 4th of July, his dad suggested Jace and Kevin should trade wives for the day just for fun. Kevin's sister even joined in once saying, honestly, they're so identical, how do you even know which one you marry? I started dreading family events, Kevin noticed. Just ignore them, he'd say. They think they're being funny, but it wasn't funny. It made my skin crawl. Jace hated it, too. He pulled me aside at Kevin's birthday party and apologized. I've told them to stop. They won't listen to me either. His girlfriend Diana was there and even she looked uncomfortable.

They're Korean. And from day one they made it clear I wasn't good enough, too white, too poor, wrong background. At our engagement dinner, my mother in law said something in Korean while looking directly at me. My wife's sister laughed so hard she almost choked on her water. When I asked what was funny, they exchanged glances and said, just an inside joke. You wouldn't understand and speaking Korean the rest of the night. Here's the thing, though. I speak Korean fluently. I studied it in college, lived in Seoul for two years teaching English and continued practicing after I moved back. I never told them why, because what my mother in law actually said that night was at least the grandchildren will look Korean. So I made a choice. For 25 years, I've sat through every family dinner, every holiday gathering, every birthday party listening to them trash talk me in Korean while I smiled and nodded like an oblivious idiot. I heard every insult, every cruel joke, every comment about how Mira could have done better. When our son was born, my sister in law said in Korean, thank god he has her eyes and not his. At our 10th anniversary, my mother in law told her friends still waiting for Mira to wake up and leave him. Last Christmas, while I was carving the Turkey, they discussed whether my American laziness was Genetic and would affect our kids work ethic. My wife Mira doesn't speak Korean. Her parents never taught her, saying she needed to focus on being properly American for school. The irony isn't lost on me. I kept my secret because I figured their opinion didn't matter as long as Mira loved me and she does. We've built an incredible life together. But last week, something happened that made me finally break my silence. We're at my daughter's college graduation party. Big Celebration at our house. Both families there, about 40 people total. I'm in the kitchen grabbing more drinks from the garage fridge when my mother in law and sister in law walk in speaking Korean. They don't see me behind the open pantry door. He's getting fat. Did you see his stomach? I know. Poor Mira. Remember that doctor she dated before him? Park's son. He just bought his third house. At least the kids look Korean. Thank.

Her best friend Kyle had been in her life since high school, and I'd always gotten along with him fine. He was at every birthday, every holiday, every group hangout. Emma trusted him completely. The stairs incident happened on a Tuesday night. I was at Emma's apartment helping her move furniture when Kyle showed up unannounced. I was coming down the stairs carrying a lamp when I felt hands on my back. I tumbled forward, hit the landing hard, and cracked two ribs. Kyle was at the top of the stairs looking shocked, saying I must have lost my balance. Emma believed him. Immediately after that, things changed. Emma started responding to my texts hours late. She'd cancel plans last minute, saying she was tired or had to help Kyle with something. When we did hang out, she seemed distracted, checking her phone constantly. I asked if something was wrong, and she said everything was fine. But her voice had this edge to it I'd never heard before. Kyle started showing up everywhere. If Emma and I were grabbing dinner, he'd text asking to join. If we were watching a movie at my place, He'd call saying he needed to talk to her about something urgent. She'd always take the call in another room, and I could hear her voice through the door, but couldn't make out words. I noticed Kyle's car parked outside Emma's apartment at odd hours. 3 a m. On a Wednesday, 6 a m. On a Sunday. I didn't mention it because I didn't want to seem jealous or controlling. But then Emma started saying things that didn't sound like her. She tell me

I've been married to Lisa for five years. My daughter faith is 22 and lives with us while she finishes college. She has a part time job at a coffee shop and helps with rent and groceries. When Lisa and I first started dating, she and faith got along great. They go shopping together, watch movies. The whole stepmom thing seemed perfect. But that changed fast once we got married. Lisa has really bad OCD and hate it's when things aren't done exactly her way. Like if faith doesn't unload the dishwasher right when it's done, Lisa loses it. Or if the trash isn't taken out the second it's full. Normal household stuff that most people wouldn't freak out about. But here's the thing. Lisa won't actually talk to faith about any of it. She just comes to me complaining and expects me to handle everything. Tell faith to clean her room, tell faith to do the dishes, tell faith she's being lazy. I've told Lisa a thousand times that she's an adult and can speak to faith directly, but she refuses, says it's not her place because she's not Faith's real mom. So I end up being the middle man in my own house, passing messages back and forth like we're in middle school. Then I found out Lisa was talking trash about faith to all her friends, saying faith was spoiled and entitled and lazy, saying I was a terrible parent who raised a bratty kid. This is a 22 year old who works go goes to school full time, and pays her own bills. Last year it got so bad that I snapped at both of them. I told faith she needed to start looking for her own place, but I also told Lisa that I was done with how she talked about my daughter and that she needed to get therapy or anger management. I specifically said if she refused to get help, I would file for divorce.

Then last year, my mom had a stroke. She died seven weeks later, and I was completely destroyed. To make everything worse, the hospital social worker called Child Protective Services, and they contacted my dad. I wanted to stay with my grandparents or my aunt or uncle.

The class erupted in whispers. Missus Wilson's voice got tight. The curriculum says. Actually, I interrupted, pulling up the state science standards on my phone, the current curriculum specifically mentions this myth as something to correct. I showed her the screen. That's when she asked me to step into the hallway. The kids watched wide eyed as the door closed behind us. Do you have any idea how hard it is to teach these kids when parents undermine my authority? She hissed. Now they'll question everything I say! I kept my voice calm. Isn't that exactly what we want them to do? Question things and learn critical thinking? I've been teaching for 22 years, she snapped. I'm not changing my whole curriculum because some nurse thinks he knows better than our textbooks. That night, Lily asked me if she was in trouble because Missus Wilson kept giving her mean looks all afternoon. I assured her she wasn't. The next day, Missus Wilson announced a pop quiz with questions like what colour is blood inside the body? Lily answered red and got marked wrong. She came home crying with a big red F. I requested a meeting with the principal and brought printouts of medical textbooks, state science standards, and Lily's quiz. Principal Davis listened carefully, then called in Missus Wilson. When confronted with the evidence, Missus Wilson insisted, this is how I've always taught it. Principal Davis asked But is it correct? After a long pause, Missus Wilson said, it's what the children understand better. I lost it. My daughter is crying every morning before school because she's afraid of getting F's for writing down the truth. Two weeks later, the school replaced their 1998 science books. Missus Wilson was required to attend professional development on current scientific standards. On Lily's next report card, Missus Wilson wrote, excellent critical thinking skills. But at the parent teacher conference, she wouldn't look me in the eye. And when I signed up to help with the science fair, I noticed my name had been crossed off the volunteer list. Lily still checks with me whenever she learns something new at school. Dad, is this actually true, or is it just a Missus Wilson truth?

My daughter's fourth grade teacher told her class that blood is blue inside your body and only turns red when it hits oxygen. Lily came home repeating this fact while showing me her veins. I gently explained, that's actually not true. Blood is always red because of hemoglobin. Just it's darker red in veins. She looked at me confused, but Missus Wilson showed us a whole Powerpoint about it. Dad. She even had diagrams from a science book. Next morning, I packed my work scrubs in my bag. I'm an ER nurse at Mercy General and I was working the 3 p m. Shift. Anyway, I sent Missus Wilson an email asking if I could do a quick 15 minute presentation about blood for Career Day that afternoon. She loved the idea. When I arrived, Missus Wilson introduced me as Lily's dad, who works at the hospital. Twenty eight kids stared up at me from their desks, covered in Lisa Frank folders and Minecraft pencil cases. I heard you guys Learned that blood is blue inside your body, I said. The entire class nodded enthusiastically. Missus Wilson beamed from her desk. I pulled out a vacutainer blood collection tube from my pocket. This is what we use to draw blood at the hospital. Notice something? I held it up. The tube creates a vacuum. No oxygen inside at all. Missus Wilson smile started fading as I explained When we draw blood with these, it never touches oxygen until we pop the cap off. But I showed photos on my phone of sealed blood tubes, still red. The kids were fascinated. I showed them medical textbook pages on my tablet. Missus Wilson kept clearing her throat, her face getting redder than the blood samples on my screen. But our textbook says it's blue, one boy argued, pointing to their science book. I walked over and checked the publication date. 1998. Medicine updates pretty fast, I explained. We used to think lots of things that turned out to be wrong. Missus Wilson suddenly stood up. Well, thank you for that interesting presentation, Mister. Johnson, but we need to move on to math now. I nodded and started packing up.

I ate my breakfast in silence, watching my family completely ignore the fact that I existed. And honestly, I felt nothing. No sadness, no anger, just calm. After breakfast, I cleared my throat. I have something to show you all. My dad lowered his newspaper, slightly annoyed at the interruption. Mom turned around from the dishes. My siblings finally looked up from their phones. I pulled out my laptop and opened it on the kitchen table. The MIT acceptance letter was already on the screen, big and bold and undeniable. I got into MIT, I said, calm. Full academic scholarship covers everything, tuition, room, board, books. Email came three months ago. The silence that followed was deafening. Dad's newspaper slipped from his hands onto the table. Mom dropped a dish into the sink with a loud clatter. My brother's mouth literally fell open. My sister just stared. Three months, dad finally said, his voice barely a whisper. Got into MIT three months ago and you didn't tell us. I looked him straight in the eye. I figured you wouldn't care much. Money is tight, right? You know how it is.

We would have, would have what? I cut him off. Noticed me for once. Put down your phone. Actually remembered it was my birthday without me having to remind you.

I've already found an apartment near campus with two other incoming freshmen. Paid first and last month's rent with money I saved from the grocery store. My bags are half packed upstairs. Dad tried to stand up, but his legs seemed to give out. He sat back down heavily. Son, we can talk about this. We, and there's nothing to talk about, I said, closing my laptop. I just wanted you to know that the kid you ignored, the one who wasn't worth a birthday gift, is going to MIT. Thought you should hear it from me. Before I disappeared.

As I reached my bedroom door, I heard dad call out my name. His voice cracked, but I didn't turn around. I had spent 18 years waiting for them to see me. Now I was done waiting.

For context, I'm 38, she's 36, and we've been married for 15 years. We have two kids, 14 and 11. And for the most part, we get along great. She's my best friend. We laugh together. We parent well together. And I can honestly say I still care about her deeply. But our intimate life has been dead for years. It wasn't always like this. First seven or eight years were amazing. We couldn't keep our hands off each other. Even with young kids and crazy schedules, we made it work. But around four years ago, something shifted. She started turning me down constantly. At first it was once a month, then every two months, and basically never unless she initiated, which happened maybe four times a year. I tried everything, planned date nights. She'd cancel because she was too tired. Suggested weekend mornings when the kids were at friend's houses. She'd suddenly need to deep clean closets, bought her favorite wine, cooked her favorite meals, left work early to help around the house so she'd be less stressed. Nothing worked. Every rejection chipped away at me. I'd lie in bed next to her feeling like a strange in my own marriage. The worst part, she'd still cuddle me, hold my hand, kiss my cheek, tell me she loved me every day. But the second I tried to take things further, she'd go Cold. It felt like living with someone who loved me just enough to keep me around but not enough to actually want me. I brought it up so many times. She always say, I'm just stressed. Work has been crazy. I'm touched out from the kids. Can we talk about this later? Later never came. So about 6 months ago, something in me just wrote, not in an angry way, but in a survival way. I realized I had two choices. Keep destroying myself by wanting someone who didn't want me back or train my brain to stop wanting her all together. I chose option 2. I started treating her exactly like I treat my closest male friends. Friendly, supportive, caring, but zero romantic thoughts. Never my mind wandered that direction. I'd shut it down immediately and redirect to something else. At first it was torture, but after a few months it actually worked. I stopped seeing her as my wife and started seeing her as just my friend and co parent. During those six months, she didn't notice a thing. I was still kind, still helpful, still asked about her day. I just stopped initiating anything physical, stopped the lingering hugs, the flirty comments, the hopeful glances and she didn't even register the change. Then last Tuesday happened.

See, here's the thing about working at places like this. You learn everyone's business, whether you want to or not. Parents dump their kids here and then spend the whole time on phone calls discussing private stuff, thinking we're not paying attention. Bryce included. I'd overheard him on multiple calls with his girlfriend complaining about money, his car payments, and how he was only taking this management job temporarily until something better came along. Also mentioned several times how he was using the employee discount to throw his nephew's birthday party here next weekend and how he was planning to hook himself up with free food and decorations. So when Bryce's nephew's party rolled around, I was working the front desk. Bryce spent the whole morning setting everything up, ordering way more food than the party package included and loading up on decorations and party favors. When his sister showed up with the birthday kid, she tried to hey and Bryce waved her off, saying it was all taken care of. That's when I printed out an itemized receipt for everything he'd taken. The party package, extra food, decorate, extended time in the private party room, extra party favors, all of it came out to around $300. I walked over with the biggest smile and handed it to his sister. Hi, I just wanted to make sure you had your receipt for everything. Bryce ordered quite a bit. Extra for the party today. His sister looked confused and asked what the total was. When I told her, she looked at Bryce like he'd lost his mind. You said this was going to cost like $50? Bryce's face went completely red. He tried to laugh it off and say there must be some mistake, but I just smiled and said, oh, no, everything's correct. Bryce ordered all these extras and company policy says all food and decorations have to be paid for. Employee discount only applies to the basic party package, which was totally true, by the way. The employee discount he was planning to use was only 10% off the basic package, not a free for all on extras. His sister ended up paying for everything, but she was pissed at Bryce for misleading her about the cost.

My dad had been promising to take me fishing for over a year. Every time I brought it up, he'd say the same thing. When I get a weekend off, buddy. Soon. But weekends came and went. My birthday, too. Eventually I just stopped asking. I was in seventh grade when my classmate Jake invited me over for the first time. His house was small and cluttered, with toys scattered around and dishes in the sink, but it felt warm somehow. Jake's dad was sitting at the kitchen table when we walked in, still wearing his work uniform from the auto shop. You must be Brady, he said, standing up to shake my hand. Jake's been talking about you all week. We went to Jake's room to play video games, but his old console wasn't working right. His dad came in and sat on the floor with us, messing with the wires until he got it running. Then he made us hot chocolate and sat there cracking jokes while we played. When I mentioned I'd never been fishing, Jake's dad's eyes lit up. We go every Sunday morning. You should come with us. I didn't say anything, but my heart jumped. I've been begging my dad to take me fishing since I was 10. That night, I went home and quietly asked my dad again. Can we go fishing this Sunday? Just for A few hours. He looked up from his laptop with that familiar tired expression. I've got quarterly reports due Monday morning. Maybe next weekend. All right? I promise we'll do something soon. I nodded and went to my room. But Sunday morning at 6 a m. I heard a knock on our door. Jake's dad was standing there in his fishing gear, holding an extra rod. Ready to catch some fish? He asked with a big smile. I left a note on the kitchen counter. Gone fishing with Jake's family. Back by dinner at the lake. Jake's dad showed me how to bait the hook, how the cast without tangling the line, and how to be patient. We didn't catch much, just a couple small bass. But I felt something I hadn't felt in a long time. I felt important. Jake's dad asked me about school, about what I wanted to do when I grew up, about my favorite movies. He actually listened to my answers. When I told him about the science project I was working on, he got genuinely excited and started giving me ideas. Around noon we packed up and drove back. The whole all ride home, Jake's dad was telling stories about when he was a kid, making us laugh until our sides hurt. When I got home that evening, my dad was in his office, still working on those reports. Looked up when I walked in. How was fishing? He asked. It was amazing. I Said we caught two bass and Jake's dad taught me how to tie different knots. My dad nodded. That's great, buddy. I'm glad you had fun. There was this weird silence for a moment. Then he said, you went with them to the lake? I shrugged. Yeah, it was only a 30 minute drive. My dad's face changed. He closed his laptop and really looked at me.

You don't get its silly perks. I work at one of those indoor trampoline parks where parents drop their kids off and pretend they don't exist for two hours. The job comes with some pretty sweet perks that nobody talks about. Free access to the trampolines after hours, employee discounts on birthday parties. And the best part, I get to eat leftover pizza from kids parties that parents never bothered to pick up. Plus my co workers are actually cool. We're all college kids or people between real jobs, so we just vibe and make the best of it. Enter Bryce, my new manager who got hired three months ago. This guy clearly thinks he's running some Fortune 500 company instead of watching kids bounce around on trampolines. First week on the job he called a staff meeting to discuss professional development and brand image. I'm talking about a place where the main job requirement is knowing how to work a cash register and occasionally telling kids not to do backflips off the foam pit walls. Bryce started implementing all these new rules no phones during shifts, even when it's dead empty on Tuesday afternoons. No talking to co workers unless it's work related. No eating the leftover party food because it looks unprofessional. And the worst part? Started scheduling mandatory team building exercises on our days off. But what really set me off was when he started making comments about how my job wasn't Real work and how I should be grateful for the opportunity to gain work experience and customer service. literally said this while I was cleaning puke out of the phone pit because some kid ate too much cake before jumping around last week. He really crossed the line. I've been working there for 8 months, longer than anyone except the assistant manager, Katie. This family came in for their kids birthday party and everything was going fine until their cake fell off the table. The mom was freaking out, the birthday kid was crying, and I felt bad for them, so I offered to comp their pizza order since we mess up food order sometimes anyway and usually just eat the mistakes. It was like 20 bucks. No big deal. The family was super grateful, the kid cheered up, and everyone had a good time. Bryce pulled me aside later and goes, your silly little job here has rules, and you don't get to make executive decisions about comping food. This isn't a charity, it's a business. Then he wrote me up for exceeding authority and unprofessional decision making. That's when I decided. Bryce

One, when I did tattoos, I had a guy come into the shop that wanted Mister 113 on his wrist. Not really all that out of the ordinary. We get it drawn up. My coworker placed it and she starts to do the tattoo. As soon as she starts, the guy screams in pain and jumps up. What the hell is in that thing? Is there a needle in there? That freaking hurts. What? This guy was in his 30s or 40s. How do you not know how tattoos are done? He said, I don't know, just thought it was some permanent ink or something. The guy went outside for almost an hour to drink and I guess hyped himself up. He got the outline done at least, but couldn't take the pain anymore and didn't get it filled. Still can't believe he didn't know tattoos were done with a needle. 2. I drive for Uber on the weekends and one time a girl who was in her late 20s told me that I was making her uncomfortable. I haven't said a word the whole trip. So I asked how I could make the situation better. She said she didn't like how I kept playing with a fidget stick in the middle of my car. I drive a manual. She then told me that I didn't need to use that because her car didn't have that and claimed to be a mechanic. 3. I used to work in a grocery store and this elderly woman said 25 cents a pound. I can get them 4 pounds for a dollar at Safeway. 4. I was in a college class and we were talking about agriculture. Me being from a farming town, I was explaining how important certain aspects of farming are, interesting and super important. This one student was not budging and she was refusing whatever I was saying. I asked her why she was so against farming and she said, I think we should get rid of all of them. We don't need them. I asked her if she liked to eat and she said we would be fine. We could just get food from the stores. I asked her how she planned on getting that food into the store. She responded with, well, they already make all the food in the store as it is, right? Why do we need farms? They're stealing money from our local businesses. So in a nutshell, she thought everything, flowers, fish, chicken, loaf bread and like everything was made in the stores and that's why we don't need farms. 5. If I could find a country that didn't take immigrants and I'd move there.

He was only doing this for her, not for me. Never for me. I showed up at their house on a Saturday afternoon. She opened the door with this huge smile, introduced herself as Nicole, and hugged me like we were already family. My dad stood in the hallway looking uncomfortable. She made coffee and brought out cookies she baked that morning. She kept talking about how happy she was to finally meet me, how she'd been telling my dad for over a year that family was important. Then she asked the question, so what happened with you two? Your dad said you guys just grew apart. She was looking at me with these kind eyes. If she genuinely cared. My dad was staring at his coffee cup, his jaw tight. I looked at him for a second. He wouldn't even make eye contact. So I told her everything. I told her my mom died giving birth to me. I told her my dad gave me to his sister, and I grew up in her house, not his. I told her about the family events where he ignored me. The things he said when I got older. About me killing my mom. I told her about the therapy, the crying at church, the years of trying to get him to love me. I told her about graduation day, when he told me to never bother him again. Nicole's face went completely white. She put her coffee down and Looked at my dad. Is this true? He didn't answer. She asked again, louder. Is this true? He finally nodded. She stood up and walked out of the room. I heard a door slam upstairs. My dad looked at me with pure rage. You just ruined everything. She's been the only good thing in my life since your mother died, and you just destroyed it. Stood up and headed for the door. Maybe you should have thought about that before you destroyed me for 27 years. I left. Two days later, my grandma called. She said Nicole had called her crying, asking if what I said was true. My grandma confirmed it all. Now, apparently, Nicole staying at her sister's place and won't answer my dad's calls.

Wait, what? I was shocked. Ben's best friend Trevor had mentioned something similar a few weeks back when he stopped by to grab some tools. Ben forgot, he said. Ruth was constantly getting on Ben's case about the divorce, telling him he was an idiot for throwing away his family. She even kept me as a friend on Facebook while Ben blocked me everywhere. Emma grabbed my phone before I could stop her and called Ruth right there in the studio. Grandma, we're getting family pictures done. You want one with mom in it or just us kids? I could hear Ruth's voice through the phone loud and clear. Oh, sweetheart, I definitely want one with your beautiful mother. She's still family to me. My heart melted a little. After 18 years of feeling invisible in that family, here was Ruth actually wanting me included. So right there, I decided to order her the biggest, most beautiful print they had. I got an 8 by 10 glossy photo of all four of us. Me in the center with my arms around the kids, all of us genuinely smiling and laughing. Then I went to the frame shop next door and had it professionally matted in this gorgeous silver frame. I shipped it to Ruth's house with a note that said, thank you for always making me feel welcome in your family. Love, Sarah and the kids. What I didn't know until later was where Ruth decided to Hang this masterpiece. Trevor called me two weeks later, absolutely dying with laughter. Apparently, Ruth hung our family portrait right in her front entryway. The first thing you see when you walk through her door. So now every single time Ben visits his mom, the first thing he sees is my smiling face staring back at him from a beautiful family photo that very clearly shows how much better off we are without him. Ever said Ben's face went completely white the first time he saw it. He stood there for, like, 30 seconds just staring, then asked his mom why she had that up. Ruth looked him dead in the eye and said, because that's what a real family looks like, Benjamin. Maybe you should have thought about that before you threw yours away. Ben apparently tried to convince her to take it down, but Ruth refused. She told him if he didn't like seeing his ex wife's happy face, he could visit less often.

My dad gave me to his sister the day I was born. My mom died having me. My aunt told me years later he blamed me for it and couldn't handle looking at me. Growing up, I'd see him at Christmas or Thanksgiving and he'd walk right past me like I didn't exist. When I got older, around 12 or 13, he started saying it out loud. You killed her, he'd tell me at family dinners when nobody was listening. I can't even look at your face without seeing what you took from me. I went to therapy three times a week in middle school. I used to pray at church every Sunday, crying, asking god if I was going to hell for killing my mom. That's how messed up his words made me. But I kept trying anyway. I kept thinking maybe one day he'd change his mind about me. After I graduated high school, he told me straight up to never contact him again. He said he had no legal obligation to me anymore since he'd been sending my aunt money all those years. And now that was done. That's when I finally stopped trying. We went our separate ways. My aunt never mentions him. My grandparents do sometimes. And that's how I found out he got married two years ago. They were upset he didn't invite me to the wedding. But honestly, I didn't care. We weren't close. We were nothing. Then last month, his wife reached out through my grandma. She wanted to meet me. Apparently, she'd been asking about me for months. And he finally caved. He called me for the first time in nine years. He said she really wanted me in their lives and asked if we could meet at their house. Then he said something that made my blood boil. Don't tell her the real reason we don't talk, please. She thinks we just didn't get along when you were a teenager and lost touch after you went to college. I didn't agree to anything, but he kept pushing. He said this could be our chance to reconcile, that his wife was really excited to meet me and maybe we could start over. But I knew that.

The one that got me grounded for a month. My dad had this iron clad rule in our house. Whoever complained about dinner had to cook the next night's meal for the entire family. It was his brilliant strategy to shut us up about my stepmom Raylan's absolutely catastrophic cooking. For two solid years, nobody dared say a word. Her meatloaf could legitimately break windows. Her chicken was drier than the Sahara Desert, and her famous casseroles tasted like she mixed random leftovers with sadness and baked it at 450 degrees until it surrendered. But we all just sat there choking down every bite like good little soldiers because nobody wanted to face the humiliation of trying to cover six people. Then came that unforgettable Tuesday night when Raylan decided to get creative with deconstructed tacos. I'm using air quotes here because what she actually served was literally just wilted iceberg lettuce, cold ground beef straight from the pan, and stale hard shell tortillas that crumbled if you looked at them wrong. Everything was on separate plates like some kind of sad, depressing buffet. My ten year old sister Opal, took one look at her plate, tried to eat everything, and was still visibly hungry. Afterward, she's started tearing up because her stomach was growling. And that's when something inside me just completely snapped. Raylan, this isn't dinner. This is what happens when a grocery store display gives up on life. The entire dining Room went dead silent. Dad's fork froze halfway to his mouth, and I could practically see the gears turning in his head. Raylan's face turned bright red, and my older brother Paxton was staring at me like I just signed my own death warrant. Dad slowly put down his fork, cleared his throat, and said with this smug little smile, well, congratulations, kiddo. Looks like you're cooking tomorrow night's dinner for all of us. But here's the thing dad had absolutely no clue about. For the past six months, I've been working weekend shifts at my Uncle JoJo's Italian restaurant downtown. Not just busting tables or washing dishes, but actually learning everything from knife skills to sauce preparation to proper seasoning techniques. Josway had been teaching me real cooking because he said I had natural instincts and could potentially work in professional kitchens someday. Every Saturday and Sunday, I'd spend eight hours learning how to make fresh pasta, proper marinara, from scratch. Authentic Italian techniques passed down through three generations. The next evening, I walked into our kitchen with a game plan. I'd stopped at the grocery store after school and bought actual fresh ingredients with my restaurant money. Real ground beef, fresh tomatoes, white onions, authentic Mexican spices, masa harina for tortillas, and everything needed for proper street tacos. I spent three hours hand pressing corn tortillas, slow cooking carnitas until they were fall apart tender, making fresh PICO de Gallo with perfectly diced ingredients, crafting homemade salsa Verde.

So I've been a vegetarian since I was like 13 because my body just hates meat. Red meat especially makes me sick, like really sick. Doctors told my parents to just let me eat other stuff for protein and everyone was cool with it except my Aunt Carol. She thought I was full of it, just being dramatic for attention or whatever. This is the same woman who told my parents I was faking my asthma attacks until I ended up in the er one night barely able to breathe. She, she also refused to get her own kid, Stephanie, glasses for two years because she thought Steph just wanted to look cool. Turns out Stephanie couldn't see the board at school and was failing everything. But sure, Carol, great parenting. Our whole family did this thing where we'd rotate who hosted dinner every week. It was usually fine because most people would just make me a separate thing or I'd bring my own food. When it was Carol's turn, she kept insisting she'd make something I could eat. She was being weird about it, too, like overly nice and kept saying how she wanted to make sure I felt included. I should have known something was up. So we all show up at her place on a Friday night, the table set and she's made burgers. He brings mine out on a separate plate and makes this whole announcement about How? It's a special veggie burger just for me. She even showed me the empty package from some brand I'd never heard of. I was starving because I'd skipped lunch that day. And the burger actually looked pretty good, had all the toppings I liked, lettuce, tomato, pickles, the works. I sat down next to Carol at the head of the table because that's where the empty seat was. Everyone started eating and I basically inhaled my burger. Like I'm talking three bites and it was gone. I was so hungry, I didn't even really taste it that much. Carol was watching me the whole time with this weird little smile on her face. At first I thought she was just happy I liked her cooking. My mom even commented on how nice it was that Carol made something special for me. About 5 minutes passed, maybe less, then my stomach started doing that thing, that feeling when your body just decides something needs to leave immediately? Yeah, that feeling. My stomach cramped up and I felt this wave of heat rush through me. That's when it hit me. The texture of that burger was wrong. It wasn't veggie at all. It was meat. It was beef. Carol had fed me a regular burger and lied about it. I looked over at her and she was still smiling, not even trying to hide it anymore.

She walked past me and stopped in front of my brother. The room applauded until I asked my father one question. Then my wife went pale and my brother collapsed. My wife took my brother's hand. He stood up, smiling that cocky smile I'd seen my whole life. They walked to the dance floor together. Two hundred guests watched them sway to the music. I stood at the head table, completely still. My best man leaned over. Dude, what the hell? I didn't answer because three weeks ago, I'd found the months of messages between my wife, Sarah, and my brother, Derek. I wish it was you I was marrying. 10 years we've hidden this. I'm tired of pretending. After the wedding, we'll figure it out. Just play along for now. They've been having an affair for a decade, since before Sarah and I even started dating. She'd chosen me as the safe option, the stable one. But she'd never stop sleeping with Derek. And tonight, at our wedding, she was making her move. I'd known for three weeks, and I'd planned for three weeks. The song ended. Sarah and Derek pulled apart, both glowing. The crowd applauded. Sarah walked back toward me, a triumphant look in her eyes. I picked up the microphone. Beautiful dance, I said, my voice calm, really touching. Sarah smiled. Derek raised his Glass to me. Actually, I continued, since we're sharing secrets tonight, I have one, too. Sarah's smile flickered. Dad, I said, turning to where my father sat, do you remember that business loan Derek asked you for three years ago? The one for $50,000? My father looked confused. Of course. Why? Why did he ever pay you back? Dad's face darkened. No, he said. The business failed. I nodded. Interesting, because I have the bank record showing that business never existed. The room went quiet. Derek's face went pale. What are you doing? He said, his voice tight. I'm sharing, I said pleasantly. Like you and Sarah have been sharing for 10 years. Gasps rippled through the crowd. Sarah's hand flew to her mouth. The $50,000 dad gave you. You spent it on hotel rooms, gifts for Sarah, all while she was dating me. I pulled out my phone and connected it to the projector. I have every receipt, every text message, every lie. The screen lit up behind me. Text messages between Sarah and Derek filled the wall. I can't wait to be with you for real. He'll never suspect anything. After the wedding, we'll figure out how to tell him. My mother stood up, her hand over her heart. Derek, is this true? Derek couldn't speak. But that's not even the best part, I said. Sarah, do you want to tell everyone or should I? She was crying now. Please stop. Stop. We're just getting to the good Part I advanced the slideshow. A photo of a marriage certificate appeared, Derek's name and another woman's name.

I paused, looked around and said, I never got any money. The entire table went silent. You could hear the clinking of silverware from other tables, but at ours, dead quiet. My parents froze. My dad's fork literally clattered onto his plate and my mom's hands started shaking as she reached for her wine glass. What do you mean you never got any money? Grandma asked. Voice getting that sharp edge I remembered from when she caught my cousins lying as kids. My mom cleared her throat nervously. Mother, we can explain this later. No, grandma's voice cut through the air like a knife. Explain it now. I've been sending 3 thousand dollar checks to Monica every single month since Aubrey started college. Where is that money? My brain was spinning. Three thousand dollars a month for four years? I started doing the math in my head while everyone stared at me. That's when my little sister Savannah, who'd been scrolling through Instagram this whole time, suddenly looked up. Oh, wait, is that where mom got the money for my BMW? If the table was quiet before, now it was like a tomb. Savannah, shut up, my mom hissed. It was too late. And my spring break trip to Cancun last month, Savannah continued, completely oblivious to the horror spreading across everyone's faces. And that designer bag You bought me for Christmas. I felt like I was watching my life in slow motion. Four years, four brutal years of working three jobs just to afford ramen noodles and textbooks. 60 hour work weeks while my parents took family vacations. Sleeping in a moldy basement apartment while my sister got a luxury car. You from me, I said. My voice barely a whisper. My dad finally found his voice. Aubrey, Sweetheart, it's not what it looks like, really. I stood up, my chair scraping against the floor because it looks like you watched me destroy my health working multiple jobs while you used my money to spoil Savannah. The restaurant felt like it was spinning. I remembered all those phone calls home begging for help with textbooks, with rent, with groceries. All those times they said money was tight. They couldn't help. I needed to learn responsibility. How much? Grandma's voice was ice cold. I did the math out loud, my voice getting stronger with each No. 3,000 * 12 months times 4 years. $144,000. My mom started crying. We were going to pay it back when you graduated. With what money? I laughed, but there was no humor in it. You don't have that kind of cash lying around. You spend it all on Savannah's lifestyle. Savannah finally looked up from her phone, realizing this was about her. Wait, so I have to give the car back? Are you serious right now? I turned to her. You're Worried about keeping a car that was bought with stolen money while I've been eating peanut butter sandwiches for dinner. That's when Uncle Stewart, who'd been unusually quiet, spoke up. Monica, please tell me you didn't actually steal from your own daughter. My mom's mascara was running down her cheeks. We thought, we thought we could replace it before she found out. Replace it how? Grandma demanded, by letting her work herself to death. I remembered the night last semester when I fainted at work from exhaustion. The manager had to drive me to urgent care because I couldn't afford an ambulance. I'd called my parents crying, telling them I didn't know how much more I could take. They told me to push through it. That success requires.

No, hello, just Lucas. Your sister's crying. She says you won't contribute. What is going on with you? I tried to keep calm. Mom, she didn't ask for a gift. She asked me to buy her an apartment. Silence, then a sigh. She's starting a new life. It would mean so much if you helped. Dad cut in, voice sharp. If you can't support your sister, maybe you should sit this one out. We don't need negativity at the wedding. That one gutted me fine. I said I won't come. The following week, Mia posted on Facebook, fake family always shows their true colors. So grateful for my real support system. Aunts and cousins chimed in with, you don't need toxic people, queen. I stayed silent until my cousin called from the bridal shower. He whispered like he didn't want to be overheard. Dude, Mia just threw a handbag back at Aunt Clara for not buying the right brand. Half the room walked out. For once, I wasn't the villain. Mia was unraveling. Then came a text from mom. We need to talk. When I showed up at my parents house, the tension was suffocating. Dad's face was granite. Mom had a stack of papers. Mia sat, arms crossed, eyes blazing. Thanks for coming, mom said tightly. We think this has gone too far. It's time to put things behind us. I'm not the one who made things tense. Got back. I was uninvited because I wouldn't buy her An apartment. Mia scoffed. I never said you had to. I just wanted you to contribute for once. You make good money, but never help. Do you know how that makes me look? You didn't ask, you demanded, I said. Jaw tight. Dad slid the papers toward me.

To make her friends laugh, I just replied, okay, I understand and hung up. The next morning her mother called her screaming hysterically, the house, dear god, what did you just let him do to the house? I was reviewing invoices at nine forty seven PM when the phone lit up. My wife Lila. I answered out of habit, still half focused on a spreadsheet. But the moment I heard laughter in the background, cheap wine clinking glasses, the echo of a restaurant, I knew something was off. Then her voice came through loud, exaggerated, dripping with fake sympathy. Mark, it's over. Don't text, don't call, just move on. Okay. Her friends howled. One even yelled. He actually picked up. I stared at my screen for exactly three seconds then said, okay, I understand and hung up. 13 seconds total. That's how long it took her to end a seven year marriage. No yelling, no questions, just silence. Then I opened a folder on my desktop labeled exit 11. Months of quiet preparation sat inside. You see, I Learned early that Lila loved chaos and hated paperwork. So while she collected followers and filmed self care hauls, I I collected signatures, notarizations and digital authorizations. Every document had a date, every account had a clause and every asset, house, car, even her joint business credit was in my name. Her prank wasn't an insult, it was an opportunity at ten O five PM, I revoked her card access. At 10:20, I paused every shared subscription she'd ever claimed. As for work, Netflix, Canva, even the forty seven dollar monthly beauty box she never opened. At 10:33, I scheduled the locksmith for 8:00am sharp. Then I made tea, chamomile. No shaking hands, no playlist, just methodical silence. Lila thought control meant volume. She never understood that true control sounds like nothing at all. The next morning, she probably woke up at 10:00am, head full of mimosas and tried to buy her truffle omelette at the cafe on Third Street. Declined. She'd have rolled her eyes and tried another card, declined again. Then she'd call her mom, half laughing. Mark's being dramatic. Her mother wouldn't laugh. She never liked me, but she respected my precision. I can picture her whispering, you actually told him it was over on speaker. Lila would SC, it was a joke. Her mother's tone would drop. Then you better pray. He thought so too. Meanwhile, I was two hours away signing the final authorization with my lawyer. By 11:00am, the house deed had transferred legally and irrevocably into the August Foundation, a trust supporting single fathers rebuilding after divorce, the same foundation I created two years ago just in case. At one PM, the locksmith texted, job complete. By three PM, the realtor uploaded the listing photos. New, really renovated 4 bedroom on Willow Lane. Move in ready? I didn't smile. I just closed the laptop. Packed A duffle bag and left. That evening, my phone buzzed non stop. Voicemails, texts, even a few missed calls from Lila's friend.

He wanted to see if she could tell the difference. She drank half of it before she asked him if he used the right milk. He started laughing and told her what he did. She got really mad, started yelling at him about how he knows she doesn't consume animal products, how it's not just a preference, but something she cares about. He kept saying it was just a joke and she was overreacting. That's why he asked me to meet him outside instead of going to the house. She told him she didn't want to see him for the rest of the day. Dad looked at me across the table and said, that's funny, right? Like he wanted me to agree with him, to laugh about it. I just sat there for a second. Then I pulled a face and said, don't think so, dad, because I really couldn't see how it was funny. His whole expression changed. He looked annoyed, maybe even angry. He said people these days can't take a joke anymore, that everyone's too sensitive. Then he said I'm his son and I'm supposed to side with him, that I shouldn't be judgmental since it was harmless. Just milk and coffee. No big deal. I told him it wasn't harmless, though. She's vegan for a reason. He made her consume something she specifically avoids on purpose just to mess with her. He waved his hand like I was being dramatic, said it's not like She's allergic. It's just a choice. I said, yeah, it's her choice. And he ignored it to prank her. He got quiet after that. Finished his coffee without looking at me. Then he said, I've changed. That I used to laugh at his jokes when I was younger. I told him I was a kid then. I didn't really get that his pranks upset people. Now I'm older and I can see when something's mean instead of funny. He didn't like that answer. We left the cafe 20 minutes later. He dropped me off at Mom's house early. Didn't even come inside. Just said, see you next week, and drove off. When I got inside, mom asked why I was back so soon. I told her what happened. She shook her head and said, your dad never grew up. Some people think pranks are a personality trait instead of just being annoying.

Did you not see what I left you? I saw it. Then why didn't you make it? Because I'm not doing all that, Claire. I offered to make coffee, not a whole production. She actually rolled her eyes at me. If you weren't going to make it right, then why offer at all? This tastes like dirt. Then make it yourself. That's when I said it. I told her, I'm not a barista. I work all night. I come home exhausted. I make coffee as a nice gesture. I'm not running a cafe. She slammed the mug down on the counter. Coffee splashed everywhere. She said I was being rude and ungrateful and that she's a guest in my home. I told her she's family, not a guest. And family doesn't hand you a recipe book for coffee at 6 in the morning.

I didn't respond. I tried to sleep, but I couldn't. I was too annoyed. Around noon, I got up and went into the kitchen. The instructions were still there. I ripped them down and threw them in the trash. That night when I got home from work, I made coffee for me and Rick, just two cups. Nathan and Claire can figure it out themselves now.

I've always been my sister's biggest cheerleader. We're only 14 months apart and basically twins. Growing up, she taught me how to perfect my jump shot. I helped her study for the SATs. We've had each other's backs through everything. when she made it to the state basketball finals and asked me to come, I showed up with a foam finger, her Jersey number painted on my face, and absolutely no shame. This was the game that could get her a full ride to Duke college. Scouts were everywhere. The gymnasium was completely sold out. I managed to squeeze into the front row of the student section, right behind the team bench. The atmosphere was insane. Everyone was on their feet, screaming. But I took it to a whole different level. Every time my sister touched the ball, I went ballistic. That's my sister! Let's go, Maya! I was jumping up and down so hard, the bleachers were shaking. About 10 minutes into the first quarter, I noticed this guy sitting in the section across from me. Letterman jacket, perfectly styled hair, surrounded by what looked like the entire football team. He kept shooting me these dark, angry looks. First I thought maybe I was being too obnoxious, so I tried to tone it down just a little. But then during the first time out, I heard him talking loud enough for his whole section to Hear! Someone over there needs to shut up about my girl. Like, we get it. She's talented, but she belongs to me. My stomach dropped. Look down at my sister on the court. She was listening to coach, completely locked in on the game. Was he talking about her? I wanted to march over there and ask him directly, but something about his vibe made me uncomfortable. Instead, I convinced myself he had to be dating some other player, because if that was my sister's boyfriend, she had terrible taste. Second quarter started, and my sister was absolutely on fire. She hit three straight three pointers. I couldn't help myself. I went right back to screaming her name, waving that foam finger like my life depended on it. This was her moment. But every single time I cheered, that guy would stare me down with this intense, scary expression. His friends kept trying to calm him down, whispering in his ear. At one point, I saw two of them physically hold him back when he started to stand up. I. I was getting genuinely scared. But there was no way I was going to let some random controlling freak stop me from supporting my sister. She needed me. This was the biggest game of her entire life. Final buzzer sounds. We win, 67 to 63. The whole team explodes onto the court. Students and parents start flooding down from the stands. I jump over the barrier and sprint across the Court looking for my sister. I finally spot her near the free throw line, surrounded by teammates. She sees me coming and breaks away from the crowd. I run straight into her arms, and she lifts me off the ground, spinning me around. We're going to Duke! She screams in my ear. I'm sobbing, she's sobbing. It's this perfect sibling moment. Suddenly, someone yanks me backward by my shirt.

I've been an ER nurse for nine years and had seen every kind of ink imaginable, but this one made my hands go numb. The guy on the gurney had come in with chest pains around two a m. Standard protocol stuff. I was taking his vitals when I lifted his left arm to check his pulse and saw it. A faded blue anchor with the letters RM under. My Uncle Ray had that exact tattoo. Same spot, same design. He'd gotten it in the Navy in 1987. Ray died in a car crash when I was 12. At least that's what my parents told me. The clipboard hit the floor. The patient opened his eyes. Okay, yeah, sorry. I bent down to grab it, but my vision was swimming. Just clumsy today. He grunted and closed his eyes again. I forced myself to keep working, wrapping the blood pressure cuff around his arm. But then I noticed his hands. The way his pinky finger curled slightly inward on the right hand. Ray had broken that finger in a bar fight, and it never healed straight. My dad used to joke about it at every family dinner. Sir, what's your name? My voice came out wrong. Marcus Webb. Not Ray Morrison? Of course not. Ray was dead. Closed casket funeral. My mom crying for weeks. But then he did this thing where he rubbed his left Eyebrow with his thumb when the doctor asked him a question. Ray did that exact movement when he was stressed. I watched him do it four more times during the examination. The doctor ordered an EKG. While setting up the leads, I had to pull his shirt up slightly. That's when I saw the second tattoo. A small compass rose on his ribs. Ray got that one the same day as the anchor. I knew because I'd seen the photos in my grandmother's album 100 times before she died. But there was something else. A newer tattoo just below it. Fresh, maybe 6 months old. It was a date. 0 8 15 2,019. My blood went cold. That was the day my cousin Bethany disappeared. Police said she ran away. She was 17. My aunt never recovered. She drank herself to death two years later. My hands were shaking so bad, I could barely attach the electrodes. You sure you're all right? The doctor asked me. Fine. Just tired. Marcus, if that was even his real name. Kept his eyes closed through the whole thing. But I couldn't stop staring at his face. The shape of his nose, the way his hairline receded at the temples. Even the small scar on his chin. From when Ray supposedly fell off a motorcycle at 19. The EKG came back normal. Probably just anxiety. The doctor said we'd keep him for observation. Anyway, I stepped out into the hallway and made myself walk. To the nurse's state. Pulled up his file. Insurance was under Marcus Webb, but the emergency contact made my stomach drop. The phone number listed was my grandmother's old landline, the one that got disconnected when she died eight years ago. I went back to his room. He was awake now, staring at the ceiling. Those tattoos, I said quietly. The anchor and compass. Military. He looked at me, and for just a second, something flickered across his face. Fear, maybe. Or recognition. Yeah. Long time ago. What branch? His jaw tightened. Navy. But I don't really talk about it. The way he said Navy, the exact inflection, the slight rest. It was Ray's voice. Pulled up a chair and sat down. Kept my voice steady. The date on your ribs. What's it mean? His whole body went rigid. None of your business. Bethany Morrison disappeared that day. He sat up fast, ripping off the EKG leads. Who the hell are you? Your niece, Claire. The color drained from his face.

My aunt never recovered. She drank herself to death two years later. My hands were shaking so bad, I could barely attach the electrodes. You sure you're all right? The doctor asked me. Fine. Just tired. Marcus, if that was even his real name. Kept his eyes closed through the whole thing. But I couldn't stop staring at his face. The shape of his nose, the way his hairline receded at the temples. Even the small scar on his chin. From when Ray supposedly fell off a motorcycle at 19. The EKG came back normal. Probably just anxiety. The doctor said we'd keep him for observation. Anyway, I stepped out into the hallway and made myself Walk to the nurse's state. Pulled up his file. Insurance was under Marcus Webb, but the emergency contact made my stomach drop. The phone number listed was my grandmother's old landline. The one that got disconnected when she died eight years ago. I went back to his room. He was awake now, staring at the ceiling. Those tattoos, I said quietly. The anchor and compass. Military. He looked at me, and for just a second, something flickered across his face. Fear, maybe. Or recognition. Yeah. Long time ago. What branch? His jaw tightened. Navy. But I don't really talk about it. The way he said Navy, the exact inflection, the slight rasp. It was Ray's voice. I pulled up a chair and sat down. Kept my voice steady. The date on your ribs. What? What does it mean? His whole body went rigid. None of your business. Bethany Morrison disappeared that day. He sat up fast, ripping off the EKG leads. Who the hell are you? Your niece, Claire. The color drained from his face.

I'm 16 and I live with my mom during the week. Every Saturday, I go see my dad at his place. But last Saturday, he texted me to meet at this cafe downtown instead. That was weird already because we always hang out at his house. When we sat down, I ordered an iced latte. Dad made this snorting sound and grinned at me. I asked him what was so funny. He leaned back in his chair and said, he pulled a prank on my stepmom. That's when I knew something stupid happened. Dad loves pranks. Always has. When I was younger, he'd play videos of cats screaming on his phone just to watch our cat freak out. He'd play dog barking sounds, too. The cat would run around the house looking for the other animals. Dad thought it was hilarious every time. He also used to flip the light switch off when I was in the bathroom. I'd be standing there in complete darkness yelling at him to turn it back on. He'd wait like 30 seconds before flipping it back. Did it at least 10 times over the years. The worst one was with my mom. This was before they divorced. Dad found this fake rubber snake at a dollar store. He knew mom was terrified of snakes since she was a kid. One night, he put it right next to her pillow while she was Sleeping. She woke up and saw it in the dark. Started screaming so loud, I heard it from my room downstairs. Dad was laughing in the hallway. Mom didn't talk to him for three days after that. So when he said he pranked my stepmom, I already knew it wasn't going to be good. I asked him what he did. He started smiling and said he made her a latte that morning. She's vegan and only drinks oat milk. He knows this. She's told him a hundred times. But he made her latte with whole milk instead.

My son Nathan and his wife Claire have been staying at our place for about two weeks now because their house flooded. Their kitchen and living room got destroyed when a pipe burst and they're waiting on insurance and repairs. I told them, no problem, stay as long as you need. I work night shifts at the hospital. I get home around 6:30 in the morning and my husband Rick is usually awake getting ready for work. We have this little routine where I make us both coffee and some eggs before I pass out for the day. It's nice, like our five minutes together before the world gets crazy again. When Nathan and Claire first moved in, I asked if they wanted me to make them coffee, too in the mornings, just being polite. They said yes to coffee but no to food. Easy enough. I just made two extra cups, basic stuff. I even told them to let me know if they wanted it different. Yesterday, Claire texted me at like 11 at night while I was on shift. she left some instructions on the counter for her morning coffee. I figured she meant like use almond milk instead of regular or add an extra scoop of grounds, whatever. This morning I walked in and there was a full page of instructions taped to the coffee maker. I'm talking like 8 steps. She wanted me to grind specific beans fresh, use some pour over thing we don't even own. Foam the milk, add vanilla syrup and caramel syrup in exact measurements, pop it with cinnamon. She even left all the supplies on the counter, the syrups, the fancy beans, a milk frother I've never seen before in my life. I stood there staring at it for like 30 seconds. Then I just made regular coffee in our regular coffee maker like I always do.

I just smiled with made my sister demand what's so funny. I pulled out my phone, sent her a video and said surprise. She started screaming. The rental car was still ticking when I saw my father's truck blocking my driveway. My sister Madison's BMW sat on the lawn, tire tracks ruining the grass. The front door hung wide open. They came out recording on their phones laughing. There he is, dad shouted, surprise, now you're broke. Madison clicked toward me in designer heels. We helped you declutter. You always want to simplify. Right through the doorway, I could see straight through to the back windows. No furniture, no nothing. Where is everything? Sold it, dad said proudly. Made about $140,000. Not bad. For two weeks. I walked through while they followed filming. Living Room TV mount empty, cables dangling. Kitchen, no microwave, no coffee maker. My home office where I built my business over 5 years completely gutted. 3 monitors, the 800 dollar chair that saved my back, external hard drives with years of work, gone. My bedroom was empty. They taken my grandfather's dresser. Where are my clothes? Goodwill, Madison said. Your sneaker collection went For more than expected, those sneakers were stories. First client meeting, rare garage sale find. Gift from my best friend before he moved to Japan, all gone. We saved you from yourself, dad said. Family helps family. Madison needed help. You weren't answering, so we made an executive decision. Something must have shown on my face, maybe a smile. What's so funny? Madison demanded. Why are you smiling? I pulled out my phone and sent the video. Surprise, I said quietly. Her phone chimed. Dad looked over her shoulder.

But she was not prepared for the backlash she was about to receive. When Jake proposed two years ago, his mother, Carol, immediately made it about her. She cried about her baby getting married, pulled out her own wedding album and spent three hours telling me how perfect her wedding was. Every single detail apparently outdid anything modern weddings could offer. Her dress alone cost $8,000 in 1994. She still had it preserved in a special closet, would take it out monthly to show visitors. The first warning sign was when we went dress shopping. Carol invited herself, then spent the entire appointment telling me why each dress was wrong. Too simple, too flashy, too white, not white enough. When I finally found the one, a beautiful silk dress with hand sewn pearls, Carol said it was nice but nothing compared to hers. She actually asked the consultant if they had anything similar to 1990 styles. The consultant looked confused. Carol pulled up photos of her dress on her phone, shoved them in everyone's face. I bought my dress anyway. Carol sulped the entire drive home. For six months, every wedding planning session became the Carol Show. She'd interrupt cake tasting to describe her seven tier cake. She'd hijack venue tours to explain how her country club was superior. When I picked roses for centerpieces, she spent 20 minutes Explaining why her cala Lily's were more elegant. Jake just let her talk. Said she was excited. Two months before the wedding, Carol started a diet, said she wanted to look good in photos. Then she joined a gym, hired a trainer, bought hundreds of dollars of supplements. I thought it was nice she wanted to be healthy. Jake thought his mom was finally focusing on herself instead of our wedding. We were both idiots. Three weeks before the wedding, Carol asked to see my dress again. Said she wanted to picture the whole event. I was at work, told her she could go to my apartment since she had a spare key for emergencies. She stayed there for four hours. My neighbor texted asking if everything was okay. When I got home, my dress was on my bed, not in its bag. Carol had.

Renee never liked her own wedding. She complained constantly about how boring it was, how nobody remembered it. But my wedding was everything hers wasn't. Beautiful venue, packed guest list. People were actually having fun. And she couldn't stand it. So she looked for any opportunity possible to ruin it for me. She. I knew she'd get away with it, too. I'd always been the quiet sister, the loyal sister. I never spread gossip. I kept every secret Renee ever told me. Protected her from our parents countless times. Until now. Sitting in that bathroom stall, something clicked. Renee never realized I'd eventually bite back. I whispered to myself. One particular secret came flooding back. Three months ago, Renee got pregnant. Her husband Mark, had been desperate to be a dad for years. They've been trying for so long. At least that's what Mark thought. Because the truth was, a few months ago, Renee had gotten pregnant, then quietly got an abortion. She told me she wasn't ready and never wanted kids. She made me swear Mark could never know. I was still torn on whether or not I should tell him to this day. But she just humiliated me on the most important day of my life. That's why when I walked out of the bathroom, I was so calm. Renee looked up at me expectantly, probably hoping for tears. She actually looked disappointed when she saw me. She had no idea the rest Of the wedding went fine. Everyone moved on. But I was busy planning something. Three weeks later, I walked into Renee's 30th birthday party. The whole family was there. Mark was there. Friends filled the living room. Renee stood in the center, laughing, soaking up attention like she always did. I walked up to her with a smile. Oh, my God, Renee, I said loudly, casually, like I was commenting on the weather. Nobody here knows about the abortion yet. The room went silent. Mark turned around. What? I looked at Renee, then at Mark, playing confused. Yeah. Remember, Renee? You guys have been trying for a baby, but you actually got an abortion three months ago. I paused. Oh, my god, girl, you didn't tell him. My voice had the exact same helpful but concerned tone she'd used at my wedding. Mark's face went from confused fusion to horror. Renee, I know she's lying. Renee stammered, her face going pale. She's making it up. I. Why would I make that up? I asked innocently. You told me yourself. You said you weren't ready. You made me promise not to tell. Mark stared at his wife. Renee, tell me she's lying. Renee's mouth opened. Nothing came out. Everyone watched her the same way everyone watched me at my wedding. You lied to me! Mark's voice cracked. We've been trying for two years. The room erupted. Mark walked out. Renee screamed at me, tears streaming down her face. Our parents rushed Over confused and horrified, I stood there calmly. I thought you liked it when people were helpful in public, I said softly, just loud enough for Renee to hear. Over the following weeks, Renee's marriage imploded. Mark filed for divorce. Our family called her a monster. I haven't seen her in two months. Last I heard, she's planning to move to Denmark and disappear.

I shouldn't have to tell you that my girlfriend's body belongs to me, he said. I stood up. If the situation was reversed, I'd tell you to go to whatever doctor you needed, I said. His face went red. That's different and you know it. He said, you're making excuses because you know what you did was disgusting. I took a deep breath and got ready to tell him the truth. Charles, those abnormal cells on my cervix were cancerous. I said, I have cervical cancer. He stared at me for about 10 seconds. So you should have thought about that before you cheated on me, he said. I made him repeat it because I couldn't believe what I just heard. You should have thought about that before you spread your legs for another man, he said, slower and louder. Now you're trying to use your cancer to manipulate me. I asked if he was actually serious, dead serious. He said, you made your choice when you let him examine you and now you have to live with the consequences. I told him the consequence was cancer and I needed treatment from a specialist. Yeah, and whose fault is that? He said, if you had found a female doctor from the start, maybe this wouldn't have happened. I stared at him in complete Shock. You think I got cancer because a male doctor examined me? I asked. He shrugged. I'm just saying that actions have consequences. Maybe if you had asked my permission first, we could have prevented this. I felt something inside me break completely. I literally have cancer, I said. He rolled his eyes. And I have a girlfriend who cheated on me. He said. We both have problems and they are both your fault. I walked to the bedroom and grabbed my phone and keys. Where do you think you're going? Charles yelled after me. I came back to the doorway. I'm leaving. We're done, I said. He laughed. You're not going anywhere, he said. We're going to sit down and talk until you admit what you did was wrong. I looked at him standing there like he had any authority over me. If you actually think a medical exam for cancer is cheating, then you're going to die alone. He tried to follow me, but I held up my hand. Don't come any closer, I said. I got in my car and backed out while he stood on the porch yelling about how I was being dramatic. He texted me that night saying he'd be willing to take me back if I promised to only see female doctors for my cancer treatment. I blocked his number and confirmed my appointment for the following week.

My sister had been neglecting her even before abandoning her. Then came the bank letter. The mortgage was three months behind. Without intervention, foreclosure would begin. I paid it, drained my savings, let my own apartment lease expire, moved into my childhood home full time because I had no other choice. Six months passed. I filed for guardianship, built my case with photos, receipt, medical records, evidence that I'd become her mother by showing up every single day. Then they came back. A lawyer's email. My parents were contesting the adoption. They'd experienced a family emergency in Spain. The note had been misunderstood. No mention of nine months of silence, no explanation for disconnected phones, just a carefully constructed narrative, painting them as victims and me as an opportunist. But I'd hired a private investigator. He found property records, a villa in Valencia purchased by my father six months after they left. Social media photos of them toasting at beachside restaurants. Lauren working as a hostess, dating the restaurant owner's nephew. No sick relatives, no, no emergency, just a new life they chose over the one they abandoned. When they showed up at my door, I opened it just wide enough to speak through the chain. Can we see Olivia? My mother asked as if she'd just returned from a weekend trip. No, I said simply. This is my house now and she's my daughter. Their lawyer tried To negotiate, I refused everything except one condition. Lauren surrenders all parental rights. Two days later, the signed papers came back. Included was a handwritten note from my sister. I'm sorry. You'll be a better mother than I could ever be. No questions about her daughter, just another abdication packaged as a compliment. The house became mine. Olivia became mine. The life we built together, painful and unexpected as it began, was officially, legally ours. Years from now, when she asks about her mother, I'll tell her the truth gently, that some people aren't ready to be what their children need. That families are built through staying, not just through birth, through showing up day after day. That she saved me as much as I saved her. Not the life I planned, but the one I now couldn't imagine living without.

Her husband Greg was already setting up their guest room before we even got there that night. I didn't take much, just clothes for a week and all the baby stuff. Greg sat me down Wednesday morning after his wife left for work. He doesn't handle divorces, but he gave me two names of solicitors who do. Good ones, who don't mess around. He also said not to tell my husband anything yet. Document everything first. Don't leave the house permanently until I talk to a lawyer. Keep all those emails. Take photos of our bank statements. My husband keeps texting me normal stuff about the wedding. His brother's freaking out about the weather forecast. The flowers got delivered. His mom is driving everyone crazy with last minute changes. I respond with short replies and baby photos like everything's completely fine. Wednesday afternoon I met with one of the solicitors Greg recommended. Her office was in the city center. She took notes while I showed her everything on my phone. Asked about our finances, whether we rent or own our house. She said I have a strong case and we should move quickly. She'd start the paperwork immediately. My brother in law called Wednesday night, asked if everything was okay because he hadn't heard from me about final travel plans. I told him the baby has a cold and I don't want to risk traveling with her right now. He sounded disappointed, but said he understood. My husband texted me annoyed, asking why I didn't tell him first. I said it literally just got worse today and I didn't want to stress him out before his brother's big day.

Said he had no idea until last month when he found messages on his wife's iPad. He hired the investigator right away, got everything he needed in two weeks. He's filing next week and wanted to warn me his wife might try contacting me. I asked him how long he thinks it's been going on. He said based on what the investigator found, at least three months, may be longer. His wife travels for work, too. That's how they met, apparently. Some conference in London back in January. I thanked him for telling me and hung up.

Three weeks later, I made an announcement of my own. She's the family outcast now. The ceremony was perfect. I was sitting at the head table taking it all in when my sister's voice cut through the crowd like a knife. Oh, my god, girl, there's blood on your dress, Renee shouted at me from across the table. Every head in the reception hall turned toward me. You're on your period. Let me get you some tampons. I sat frozen. My period wasn't due for another two weeks. Could this have happened even worse? I was sitting down. Nobody could see anything. She could have whispered. She could have pulled me aside quietly, but that wasn't Renee's style. Your periods are always so heavy. She continued loudly walking toward me with her arms out like she was about to rescue a drowning puppy. Let me get you cleaned up, sweetie. My face burned. 200 guests stared at me. My new husband looked so awkward. Renee grabbed my arm and pulled me up from my seat, ushering me toward the bathroom while everyone watched in silence. She kept talking about the period throughout the entire walk, loud enough for everyone to hear. Inside the bathroom, she positioned herself outside my stall, still going on about pads and tampons and stain remover. I sat there in the bathroom stall putting a tampon in my hands, shaking, but a Sly smile on my lips because I knew something Renee never could have imagined. That's why I simply walked out of the bathroom and smiled at her. It's fine. You see, this was classic Renee. She'd always done this, helpfulness disguised as humiliation. When I graduated college, she announced at my Celebration dinner, oh, sweetie, you have such a pretty face. Have you thought about losing weight for the photos at my engagement party, she said in front of everyone. Finally, I was worried you'd never find someone always framed as caring, always designed to steal the spotlight. Growing up, Renee was the gifted one. Straight A's, academic awards, constant praise from our parents. But as she got older, she became average. Normal grades, normal achievements. She never accepted the fact she wasn't in the spotlight anymore. So she Learned that creating drama worked perfectly. But that's not the.

The next day he woke up and saw in the mirror his white hair had turned black, his face was glowing and he looked like a handsome 20 year old. Other elderly people were jealous. Everyone asked how he did it. The old man realized the secret was the zombies bite. He had an idea to make money. He decided to charge 1 lakh rupees for a single bite. Soon old people lined up with money. All they had to do was put their hand in a hole and wait. The old man inside would signal with a knock knock sound. Tomato sauce would spill on their hand. At the same time the zombie would bite their hand. The bite was painful but the next day even an 80 year old would become young and agile. Someone in a wheelchair would stand up and start walking. One man even announced his marriage. But then the zombie virus in his body began to emerge. To find out what happens next, subscribe to the channel and leave a sweet comment.

She could have come from a crime scene. Please, we've got your dog. Please. پارٹی it's the police. We're coming in to. Get your hands where I can see him. He's in shock. We gotta get him to the hospital, make sure it's not something worse. Heard there might be a witness. Malcolm Tucker, but he's unresponsive. Mother was stabbed at least a dozen times. Not sure what he saw.

He was doing live reporting, standing in the rain. But still, after a few days, he was fired from his job. As soon as he came out of the channel, some goons surrounded him and beat him badly. When he reached home, exhausted, his wife directly demanded a divorce. At night, in anger and pain, he cursed god a lot. The next morning, he got a letter. It had the address of a hotel written in it and also wrote, come here for a new job. He reached the hotel. A man was waiting for him in the hotel. That man was actually God. God said, ask for anything. He took his hand back without saying anything and said, tell me how many fingers have I shown? God immediately replied, 7. He thought, how can there be seven? There are only, only five fingers in a hand. Then he folded two more fingers and extended his hand. But in reality, he had seven fingers in his hand. He was surprised. He showed different fingers many times, but god gave the correct answer every time without thinking. He was scared and surprised, too. Then God said, from now on, you can take my place. You will have all my powers. You can do whatever you want. Hearing this, he ran away from there in fear. While running, his feet fell into a puddle of water. But His shoes did not get wet. He started thinking, what is this?

So I spent the last year completely transforming myself. Lost 40 pounds, Learned how to do my makeup properly, got a haircut that actually suits my face. For the first time in my life, I felt genuinely confident. Journey wasn't easy. I'd wake up at 5:00am to hit the gym before work, meal prep every Sunday, and honestly cried in my car more times than I can count when the scale wouldn't budge. But slowly something shifted. Not just my body, but how I carried myself, how I looked people in the eye, how I finally felt like I deserve to take up space in this world. Lisa and I have been best friends since college. We're talking eight years of friendship here. She was my biggest cheerleader through everything. You're glowing. She'd text after I post gym selfies, I'm so proud of you. Her husband, Mark, was always nice, but we barely talked before. He was just Lisa's husband. You know, present at game nights but never really part of our conversations. Then suddenly he's texting me, hey, could you babysit Emma and Jake tonight? Lisa's working late again. At first I thought it was sweet. Their kids are 7 and 5 and I love them to pieces. I always said yes because honestly, babysitting beat another night of Netflix alone. But the requests got weird. He'd ask me to watch them on nights when I could literally See Lisa's car in their driveway. When I'd arrive, she'd be upstairs taking a nap or running errands.

And now she's. I discovered my roommate was using my personal items when I found them moved in my drawer. We've been living together for 8 months and while she was messy and ate my food, this crossed a massive line. These were expensive items I bought for my long distance relationship, kept in my private bedroom drawer in a locked box. The lock had been picked. At first I thought I was paranoid. Maybe I'd moved things myself. But then I set up a small test, position them specifically, took a photo. Sure enough, next time I travelled for work, they'd been moved. The final confirmation came when I noticed one had been cleaned and put back slightly damp. I felt violated. Instead of confronting her immediately, I went nuclear. I carefully applied itching powder, the kind from novelty shops, everything. Not enough to cause real harm, just enough to be incredibly uncomfortable. Then I waited. Two days later, Becca called in sick to work. She was in the bathroom constantly walking funny, clearly miserable. She went to urgent care claiming she had some kind of allergic reaction. The doctor prescribed cream and told her to identify any new products she'd used. That evening, Becca was on the couch with ice packs, nearly crying from discomfort. She was googling symptoms frantically, convinced she had some rare condition. I almost felt bad. Almost. You okay, I asked innocently. I think I'm allergic to something, she moaned. But I haven't changed anything. Detergent, soap, nothing. That's weird, I said. Maybe it's something you came into contact with. She went quiet, then quickly said, yeah, maybe. The itching lasted another day before subsiding. Becca was exhausted, embarrassed from having to explain her symptoms to doctors and clearly suspicious, but unable to accuse me without admitting what she'd done. I thought that would end it. But a week later, I overheard her on the phone with her sister laughing about using my things. She has no idea, she giggled. Little Miss Prude would die if she knew. That's when I realized the itching powder wasn't enough. She hadn't Learned anything, just thought she'd gotten away with it. So I escalated. I bought a nanny cam disguised as a phone charger, positioned it perfectly in my room, legal in my state for your own bedroom. The next time I left town, I caught everything, her picking my lock, going through my drawer, using my items, then washing and returning them. But here's what really got me. She brought her boyfriend into my room. They were in my bed using my things. The violation went beyond what I'd imagined. I didn't just want revenge anymore. I wanted her gone. I sent the footage to our landlord with a formal complaint about illegal entry into my locked bedroom and theft of personal property. I didn't specify what was Stolen I had video evidence of her repeatedly breaking into my locked space. The landlord was horrified. Becca was violating her lease by entering my private room without permission. She had 30 days to vacate. When Becca got the notice, she went ballistic. You set me up. You poisoned me. I put itching powder on my belongings in my locked drawer in my room. I said calmly, why would that affect you? She couldn't answer without confessing. She tried.

I grew up with Zara since we were 6 years old. We did everything together, sleepovers, small trips, shared secrets about crushes, the whole best friend package. When I started dating Kyle in junior year, Zara was the first person I told. She squealed and hugged me and said she was so happy for me. Kyle was perfect, captain of the soccer team, smart, funny, treated me like I mattered. For eight months, everything was great. Then came my 18th birthday party. My parents let me have people over while they went to dinner. About 30 kids from school showed up. Around ten PM, I realized I hadn't seen Kyle or Zara in a while. I checked everywhere before remembering my dad's vintage car collection in the garage. I opened the door and my heart stopped. There they were. Kyle had Zara pressed against my dad's Mustang, his hands in her hair, her arms wrapped around his neck. They were so into it they didn't even hear me. Then Zara opened her eyes and saw me. She didn't pull away. She just smiled at me over his shoulder. That smile told me everything. This wasn't a mistake. This was deliberate. I turned around and walked back into the house. Hands were shaking so badly I could barely hold my phone. I locked myself in the bathroom and called my older cousin, Julian. He was 22, openly Gay and had always been protective of me. I told him what happened. Through tears. He told me to kick everyone out and he'd be there in 20 minutes. When I came out, Zara and Kyle were back at the party acting like nothing happened. I looked her dead in the eyes and said, get out of my house, both of you. I told everyone the party was over. The next day at school, Zara acted like she was the victim. She told everyone I'd overreacted to them just talking in the garage. Kyle backed her up. Half our friend group believed her because Zara was that good at playing innocent. I lost my boyfriend and half my friends in one night. But what hurt most was that she didn't even want him. Two weeks later, she dumped Kyle and started dating someone else. She'd done it just to prove she could. For six months, I kept my head down. Then one night, Julian came over with an idea. He'd been watching Zara's Instagram and noticed a pattern. Every time one of our mutual friends started dating someone new, Zara would suddenly be all over their posts. She was hunting. Julian looked at me seriously and said, Wanna set a trap? Let me be your fake boyfriend. If she's still the same person, she won't be able to resist and this time we'll be ready. I thought about it for exactly 10 seconds before saying yes. We spent a week. Planning, Julian and I started posting couple photos, holding hands at the movies, cute captions about my amazing boyfriend. We made sure Zara would see everything. Her comments started immediately. Omg, so cute. I wanted to throw my phone across the room, but Julian told me to stay patient. Three weeks into our fake relationship, Zara texted me saying she was throwing a party. She's. I specifically mentioned I should bring Julian. I knew exactly what she was planning. Julian borrowed a tiny camera from his film school friend. We agreed on signals. If she made a move, he'd touch his ear twice. The party was packed. The second we walked in, Zara zeroed in on Julian like a missile. She ignored me completely and started talking to him about everything. She touched his arm. When she laughed, she stood to.

Our teacher asked everybody for their homework that morning. But when Kira didn't have it, we all watched her panic for an excuse. Uh, I was at the hospital, she said. Completely unconfident. Our teacher didn't believe her. Hospital, why were you there? Kira goes chemotherapy. Our teacher's eyes went wide and she didn't know what to say. Chemotherapy? Sorry, I had no idea you had cancer. That's when I saw it, the flash of panic in Kira's eyes that told me she had no idea what chemo actually was. Yeah, I have brain cancer. The classroom erupted in gasps and whispers and I watched as she completely loved all the attention. Her Instagram quickly became a Cancer Journey blog with daily updates about her battle. And the next day she showed up to class wearing a headscarf. The worst part was watching her boyfriend, who genuinely loved her, start a gofundme that raised $8,000 in two weeks. I was already in a bad mood and she started talking about how she was preparing for hair loss. I had to go up to our teacher before class and tell her my dad got in a car crash last night. I was really upset and kindly asked for an extension on our assignment. But she looked at me and said, did he die? I was confused. No, he's fine. But he could have. Then she actually says, sorry, I can't make exceptions. You've had two Weeks to work on this and should have been more proactive. But then Kira walked up behind me. I couldn't finish my essay. The emo yesterday was just so hard. Without even hesitating, our teacher rushed over and hugged her. Oh sweetie, take as long as you need. Your health comes first. In fact, don't even worry about it if you can't do it at all. I couldn't believe it but that night when I walked into the party at my crush's house and instantly saw Kira sitting in the corner with everyone comforting her, she was dabbing at fake tears while talking about how the radiation makes everything taste like metal. I sighed knowing this was gonna go on the entire air night. Some days I just want to give up, she whispered and I watched her boyfriend pull her closer, his eyes red with real tears. However, as Kira stood up to go to the bathroom, she act accidentally tripped over someone's foot. She stumbled forward before falling completely face first onto the hardwood floor spilling her drink. The room exploded with panic. Oh my god, is she okay? Then Kira took advantage. She quickly started holding her head pretending to be in pain but saying it's okay, I'm not hurt. But she was literally holding her head. Everyone was crawling around her trying to help her up. Poor balance is just a side effect from my therapy. The doctor said it's normal. People were crying actually crying As they helped her up, her boyfriend was frantically googling brain cancer symptoms on his phone, thinking she was actually dying. That's when I knew I had to step in. Oh, my god, I actually know how to treat this. I help you. I rushed forward. Actually being trained in first aid, Kira was loving the attention. Yeah, of course, I was in. My cousin had the same thing happened during her treatment. Kira, you probably need an ambulance. This could be serious. Her eyes went wide. And this time it was genuine. No, no, I'm fine. Really? But her boyfriend said.

I walked into my apartment Wednesday and froze. My coffee mug was in the dishwasher, but I thought I had left it in the sink. When I went to work that night, I ordered pizza and put the leftovers in the fridge. But Thursday night, three slices were gone. I figured maybe I ate them late at night and forgot, but then I found a dark hair on my pillow. My hair is blond. My sheets also felt warm when I got into bed, like someone had been lying there. I called my best friend. I. I think someone has been in my apartment. I told her. She laughed. You have been working too much. You're being paranoid. I figured maybe she was right, but then my couch started smelling like cigarette smoke. My bathroom towel was damp when I came home, even though I had not used it that morning. My TV watch history also showed programs I had never watched, and random things kept getting moved around. I felt like something was wrong, but I had no proof. On Friday, my boss let me leave work early. I was excited because I thought maybe if I came home in the middle of the day, I would stop feeling so paranoid. I parked down the street and walked to my building. I unlocked the building entrance quietly and took the stairs to my third Floor apartment. I reached my door and pressed my ear against it. I heard my TV playing and my heart started pounding. I slowly turned my key and the deadbolt clicked. I pushed the door open and my apartment smelled like cigarette smoke and cheap Cologne. The TV was on, but nobody was on the couch. My leftovers from last night were sitting on the coffee table, half eaten, with the fork still in the container. A beer bottle sat next to it. I don't drink beer. I pulled out my phone and started recording. I walked toward my bedroom and noticed that the door was half open and my bed was unmade. Someone had been sleeping there. I heard a drawer open, then humming. Someone was going through my dresser. I pushed the door all the way open. My

As a kid? When I was 12, my parents had a strict rule, no video games during the week, only weekends. But my friends would get online every night after homework and I was missing out on everything. My bedroom was directly above the living room so they could hear every footstep. The PlayStation was in my room, but the second they heard any controller clicking or game sounds, I'd be busted. That's when I discovered something brilliant, the closed captioning setting. I realised I could play games completely silent with subtitles on, no sound effects, no music, no voice acting, just pure visual gaming with text at the bottom. For two months, I played every night for about an hour after my parents thought I was asleep. I became a master of stealth gaming. I'd wait until I heard their TV turn on downstairs, then carefully power up my PlayStation with the volume at zero. I was living my best secret life until the night my dad decided to check on me. I heard his footsteps on the stairs and had maybe 10 seconds. I couldn't just turn off the PlayStation. It made noise and took too long. So I did the only thing I could. I dove into bed, pulled the covers over my head and left the game running. He opened my door and I held my breath, pretending to be asleep. Through my blanket, I could see The light from my TV screen still flickering. That's weird. I heard him mumble. He walked over to my TV. I was dead. Caught red handed, game over. But then I heard him say, honey, come look at this. My mom's footsteps came up the stairs. I was sweating under the blankets. Look, my dad whispered.

They took him away, and he finally got the freedom he wanted. My 16 year old son, Ethan, started telling people I was abusive when all I did was try to discipline him. It began small, like when I grounded him for sneaking out. He told his friend's mom I locked him in a room for days. When I took away his phone for failing three classes, I told the school counselor I destroyed his property and screamed for hours. They called me in, asked questions, and dismissed it after realizing he was exaggerating. I thought it was over, but it wasn't. Every time I tried to parent him, the stories got worse. I caught him skipping school, and when I refused to let him go out for the weekend, he told his girlfriend's parents I hit him with a belt until he bled. I had never laid a hand on him. I was strict, yes, but not abusive. I set curfews, gave chores, enforced rules, things that used to mean something. But Ethan had Learned that if he told the right story to the right person, people listened. The more sympathy he got, the more he pushed it. I used to be the mom who packed lunches and drove him to soccer. Now I was the abusive mother in every whisper around town. Teachers started watching me differently during parent conferences. Neighbors stopped waving My sister called to ask if everything was okay at home. That one hurt. She helped me raise him after his father died. Now even she doubted me. Ethan sat at the kitchen table one night, scrolling on his phone, calm as could be, while my reputation was falling apart. Why are you doing this? I asked. He shrugged. Maybe if you treated me like an adult, people wouldn't believe it. I felt something in me snap then. Not anger. Just the realization that I didn't recognize my son anymore. The next morning, two CPS agents showed up at my door. Someone, likely the school, filed a report after hearing Ethan's latest story. We received information about potential physical abuse, one said, reading from a clipboard. Ethan stood in the doorway behind them, looking almost proud. They asked questions, took pictures of my house, checked for signs of neglect. I answered calmly. There were no bruises, no evidence. Still, they said they follow up. Two days later, they came again, this time with a court order. Ethan had told them he was terrified to live with me. They said they were placing him in temporary custody for his safety. I watched as they packed his bag, my son grinning like he finally won something. I didn't fight it. I just stood there, numb as they drove off. Violence afterward was unbearable. His room was exactly how he left it. Messy. Posters crooked, half empty soda cans on the desk for The first time in years. The house was quiet. Too quiet. I didn't know whether to cry or scream.

It's the only time I can go. But that bottle was definitely half empty. Now I checked my detergent, too, also half gone. I started thinking about the timing. Mia's complaint started exactly two weeks ago, right when I bought that new fabric softener. Sunday night, I set up my old phone in the laundry room, propped it on top of the detergent shelf, camera facing the machines, hit record and left. I worked my usual overnight shift at the hospital, came home at 6:00am, exhausted, downloaded the footage, fast forwarded through hours of nothing, empty machines, dark room. Then at 3:00am, the lights flipped on. Mia walked in wearing pajamas, carrying a laundry basket. She went straight to the shelf, picked up my bottle of fabric softener, my detergent, poured a full cap of softener into the washer, added the detergent, started loading her clothes. I've been using my expensive hospital grade products for weeks. The chemical smell she kept complaining about was literally just the smell of actually clean clothes. My stuff costs 10 times what regular detergent costs because as it's designed to remove blood born pathogens and hospital contamination, it's industrial strength. She'd been stealing my supplies, using them on her own laundry, then accusing me of tampering with her clothes. Watch the whole video. She even checked the hallway twice to make sure nobody saw her. I sent the video to the group chat with one message, found the thief. Casey called her immediately. I could hear Mia's voice through the wall getting defensive. I thought it was communal. It was just sitting there. Brandon replied in the chat, it was on the shelf labelled with her name. Mia tried claiming she didn't see the label, that she was half asleep, that it was an honest mistake. I sent another message two weeks, got a mistake. Casey knocked on my door an hour later. I'm sorry. I believed her. That's insane. Mia avoided me for three days, wouldn't make eye contact, stayed in her room. Then I got a text from our landlord asking about the Wi Fi password. Apparently Mia told him she couldn't remember it. I changed it that night. She could buy her own internet. Two weeks later, Mia's mom showed up with a U Haul. Casey told me later that Mia owed $300 in utility bills she never paid.

So I stopped inviting her to mine. The message came three days before Thanksgiving. Dad called to explain that Veronica felt I made her uncomfortable at family gatherings. Too many questions about her past, too much attention on dad. She needed space to bond with her biological children without my presence disrupting the family dynamic. You understand, right, he said, his voice small. I was 22. I've been away at college for four years and visited exactly six times. But apparently that was too much. Sure, dad, I understand perfectly.

By 24, I launched my own company specializing in high end weddings and galas. My client list included celebrities, politicians and executives willing to pay six figures for perfection. Dad would text occasionally updates about Veronica's kids getting into college, photos from holidays I wasn't in. Each message felt like evidence of the family I've been edited out of. Then came the email that changed everything. A tech billionaire wanted me to plan his daughter's wedding. Budget was $2.3 million. The guest list included senators and Hollywood a listers.

My niece looked panicked and said she didn't think she could handle the kids much longer, and I felt terrible because none of this was her fault. I told her I was sorry, but her mother made this choice. Then I walked back to the car and called the one babysitter I knew who might be available on a Saturday night with zero notice.

If someone mentioned my name, she'd say we don't discuss that. Like I died or committed murder. I passed the bar exam on my first try, started working for the Justice Department, argued my first federal case at 28. One. My aunt kept a scrapbook of every achievement. Last Thursday was Thanksgiving at my grandmother's house. I hadn't been to a family gathering in nine years. Aunt Kathy convinced me to let her handle something special. I trusted her completely. The whole family gathered, 37 people. Mother holding court about my brother's promotion to district manager. She was mid story about how she raised him with values and direction when Aunt Kathy stood up, said she had an announcement. My mother looked annoyed at being interrupted. Kathy pulled out a folder, started pulling out documents, my law degree, my bar certification, letters of recommendation from federal judges, an article about my latest case from the Washington Post. She laid them out on the dining table like playing cards while everyone went silent. Since some people seem unaware, Kathy said, looking directly at my mother, your daughter graduated from Harvard Law. She's a federal prosecutor. My mother's face went through 17 different expressions. She grab the diploma, checking if it was real, started stammering about misunderstandings and communication issues. My uncle asked how long I've been a lawyer. Kathy answered for me, said four years. Four years of my mother not knowing anything about my life, my Grandmother asked my mother how she could not know her own daughter was at Harvard. My mother tried to say I'd hidden it from her. Kathy pulled out her phone, showed text messages of my mother saying she didn't care what I was doing. I was dead to her, that mentioning my name was forbidden. My cousin asked why my mother had been saying I was a failure all these years. The room turned into chaos. Relatives demanding explanations. My grandmother crying about missed years. My brother admitting he'd known but was told not to say anything. My mother tried to hug me, saying we could start fresh. I stepped back, told her she was right about one thing, I was a disappointment. Kathy drove me to Thanksgiving that day. She also drove me home. But my mother found out my address from my brother, showed up the next day and said we need to discuss my monthly fund. Full story on channel link below.

We all looked at each other confused. Nobody recognized him. Some kids shrugged, and others shook their heads. Of course you don't, missus, Barnett said with tears in her eyes. Tomorrow, wear your best all black clothes. We're going on a field trip to his funeral service. After class, I talked to my best friend Harry about it. Who do you think that guy was? No clue, man. But did you notice how weird it was that she called him that black guy? Missus Burnett never talks like that. A girl named Ashley walked up to us in the hallway. I heard he was a criminal who hurt a student. They're making the student speak at his funeral as some kind of forgiveness thing. That didn't sound right to me. When I got home, I told my parents about the weird field trip. My mom's face went red immediately. I know exactly who that man is, he said, grabbing her phone. We're going to that school right now. Who is he? I asked. Never mind that. This is inappropriate. Within an hour, my parents had organized a group of about 20 other parents. They all marched into the principal's office, demanding answers about why their kids were being forced to attend some random black man's funeral during school hours. This is a waste of valuable education time! My dad shouted at the principal. We Don't even know who this person is! Another parent yelled. The principal looked overwhelmed and kept saying it was missus Burnett's idea, and they discussed it at the next board meeting. Harry and I decided we were going to the funeral anyway. Something about this whole thing felt important and wrong at the same time. We told our parents we were going to school, but took the bus to the cemetery instead. When we got there, the parking lot was empty except for Missus Burnett's car. We found her sitting alone in front of a casket, crying her eyes out. The funeral home was completely empty besides us. She looked up when she heard our footsteps. Oh, boys, you came! She hugged us both tight. Thank you so much for being here, Missus Burnett. Where is everyone? Harry asked. They didn't want people to know the truth, she. She said, wiping her eyes. The school board made sure nobody would come. What truth? I asked. She pointed at the man in the casket. This man saved every single life in our school two weeks ago. Do you remember when we had that lockdown drill that lasted three hours? We both nodded.

My brother Jonathan is 20 now and he's been in jail for the past two years, but he's coming home in two weeks. And watching my stepdad and stepbrother panic has been the most satisfying thing ever. Let me explain. Our dad died when I was 7 and Jonathan was ten. Before dad died, he always told Jonathan to look after me no matter what. My brother took that seriously, like really seriously. He became super protective of me after that. Three years after dad died, mom started dating Sam. Sam came with his son James, who was the same age as Jonathan. From day 1, Jonathan and Sam didn't get along. My brother has this thing where he doesn't just respect people automatically. You have to earn it with him. Sam tried acting like he was Jonathan's dad, giving him orders and setting rules. Every single time, Jonathan just ignored him. It drove Sam crazy. James thought he could copy his dad and try to boss Jonathan around, too. That was a mistake. Worst part was James making fun of our dad. I was in my room one day when I heard James telling his friends that my dad probably died because he was weak. He was laughing about it. I started crying and Jonathan heard me from downstairs. Never seen my brother move that fast. He went straight to James's room and I heard this loud thud. When I came out, James was on the floor, completely knocked out. Jonathan had punched him so hard that James didn't wake up for like 5 minutes after that. Everyone walked on eggshells around Jonathan. If anyone even looked at me wrong, all Jonathan had to do was stare at them and they back off immediately. James was terrified of him. Sam was, too, but he acted tough around mom. Then two years ago, Jonathan got arrested with his friend for something completely unrelated. I can't say what, but it wasn't about James or anything violent at home. He got sentenced to jail time and suddenly everything changed. The second Jonathan left. James started bullying me bad. He'd call me names, knock my stuff over, lock me out of the bathroom. I told mom, but she just said boys will be boys and to toughen up. Sam acted like he didn't see anything I.

I wrote him like 10 letters in the first month, but he never wrote back. I couldn't understand why my brother would ignore me when I needed him. My uncle came to visit after six months and asked why I hadn't been writing to Jonathan. Jonathan kept asking about me and was worried something was wrong. That's when I found out mom had been throwing away every single letter I sent. When I confronted her, she admitted it. She said Sam told her to do it because he didn't want Jonathan causing problems from jail. I begged her to let us write to each other. She said no. She even called the prison and told them I was a minor so they wouldn't accept my letters even if I sent them directly. I've gone two years without talking to my brother while James made my life hell. But now Jonathan's coming home in two weeks and mom has been acting so weird. He barely talks, just stares at her phone looking stressed. She knows I'm going to tell him everything. The best part is watching Sam and James. Last week, James mentioned something about finding his own apartment and moving out soon. He's 19 and has never had a job in his life, but suddenly he wants to move out right before Jonathan comes home. Sam keeps asking mom. If Jonathan knows what's been going on. Mom says she doesn't think so, but she's not sure. Every time I mention my brother coming home, I watch the color drain from their faces. I get this look of pure fear, and I love it. Yesterday, James asked me if I was planning to tell Jonathan about what happened while he was gone. I just smiled and said, I miss my brother so much and we have a lot to catch up on. He went straight to his room and I heard him on the phone looking at apartments. Here's the thing they don't know yet. The house we're living in actually belongs to Jonathan. Dad left it to him in his will, but he had to be 20 to inherit it. He turned 20 in February while he was in jail. So technically, Sam and James are living in my brother's house. Two weeks until Jonathan comes home, Sam and James are scared, and I couldn't be happier about it.

I smile and say, no, really, I don't eat meat. The panier is perfect. She finally puts the panier on my plate, but she's got this look like I personally insulted her cooking. Whatever I start eating, the panier is actually pretty good. And I'm having a normal conversation with Aaron about this movie we both watched. Not even 10 minutes later, Priya's mom comes back around with the mutton bowl. She literally stands next to my chair with a serving spoon and says, beta, you haven't even tried the mutton. Just take one piece. I put my fork down. Auntie, I already told you I'm.

We'd only met twice before, but she seemed pretty cool and I figured it might help us get to know each other better. Fast forward to three weeks ago. We drove to Jason's hometown to visit his family and talk wedding stuff. His brother Greg, Greg's wife Monica, and Avery came over to his parents house. Second I saw Avery, I noticed something different. She was wearing baggy cargo pants, an oversized hoodie, and her hair was pulled back in a messy bun. Way more casual than the last time I'd seen her in a floral sundress. We sat in the living room drinking coffee, and Jason's mom brought out wedding magazines. She started flipping through pages of bridesmaid dresses, pointing at the puffy ones and the sparkly ones. Avery shifted in her seat. Her shoulders got tense. She stopped making eye contact with anyone. Monica noticed. Oh, we'll have to take you shopping soon, honey. Get you something pretty and feminine for once. She laughed like it was a joke, but Avery's face went red. Jason's mom chimed in, yes, and maybe we can do something with your hair. A nice updo would look so lovely. Greg nodded. It'll be good for you to dress up. You're at that age where you should be presenting yourself better. I watched Avery sink deeper into the couch. She pulled her hoodie sleeves over her hands. Then Monica said it. It'll be nice to see you dressed like a girl for once. My stomach dropped. I was a total tomboy growing up. Hated dresses, hated makeup. My aunt used to say things exactly like that to me at every family gathering, and it crushed me every single time. I still remember hiding in the bathroom.

She called me right away, voice all tight, asking why I was being difficult about this. I explained that I'm their dad and she's not going to be here, so obviously they should be with me. She said I wasn't thinking about what's best for the kids, that they need stability, that her husband has been in their lives for two years and they're attached to him. I told her I'm not cutting him out completely. He can still see them, do stuff with them. Whatever. But when she's deployed there with me, that's when things got ugly.

I said no to all of it. I reminded them that our custody paperwork literally says if she deploys, I get the kids. We live in California. It's written right there in black and white. He said the paperwork was outdated and didn't account for him being in the picture. Now, I said that's not how legal documents work.

I told her I'm not cutting him out completely. He can still see them, do stuff with them. Whatever. But when she's deployed there with me, that's when things got ugly. She started saying I was being controlling and unreasonable. Her husband got on the phone next and started making demands. He wanted every other weekend and he wanted Wednesday nights, too. I said no to all of it. I reminded them that our custody paperwork literally says if she deploys, I get the kids. We live in California. It's written right there in black and white. He said the paperwork was outdated and didn't account for him being in the picture. Now, I said that's not how legal documents work. He got mad and said I was being a jackass and trying to erase him from their lives. I stay.

I showed up at their house on a Saturday afternoon. She opened the door with this huge smile, introduced herself as Nicole and hugged me like we were already family. My dad stood in the hallway looking uncomfortable. She made coffee and brought out cookies she baked that morning. She kept talking about how happy she was to finally meet me, how she'd been telling my dad for over a year that family was important. Then she asked the question, what happened with you two? Your dad said you guys just grew apart. She was looking at me with these kind eyes like she genuinely cared. My dad was staring at his coffee cup, his jaw tight. I looked at him for a second. He wouldn't even make eye contact. So I told her everything. I told her my mom died giving birth to me. I told her my dad gave me to his sister and I grew up in her house, not his. I told her about the family events where he ignored me, the things he said when I got older about me killing my mom. I told her about the therapy, the crying at church, the years of trying to get him to love me. I told her about graduation day when he told me to never bother him again. Nicole's face went completely white. She put her coffee down and looked at my dad. Is this true? He didn't answer. She asked again louder. Is this true? He finally nodded. She stood up and walked out of the room. I heard a door slam upstairs. My dad looked at me with pure rage. You just ruined everything. She's been the only good thing in my life since your mother died, and you just destroyed it. Stood up and headed for the door. Maybe you should have thought about that before you destroyed me for 27 years. I left. Two days later, my grandma called. She said Nicole had called her crying, asking if what I said was true. My grandma confirmed it all. Now, apparently, Nicole's staying at her sister's place and won't answer my dad's calls.

It'll be good for you to dress up. You're at that age where you should be presenting yourself better. I watched Avery sink deeper into the couch. She pulled her hoodie sleeves over her hands. Then Monica said it. It'll be nice to see you dressed like a girl for once. My stomach dropped. I was a total tomboy growing up, hated dresses, hated makeup.

Everyone looked at me. My best friend Kelsey is my maid of honor, and she's wearing a suit. Like, a full tailored suit with pants. I told all my bridesmaids they can wear whatever they want as long as it's in our wedding color, which is dark green. Avery's head snapped up. Really? Yeah, absolutely. Hold on. I pulled out my phone and opened the folder where Kelsey had sent me outfit ideas, scooted closer to Avery on the couch and started showing her photos. A green jumpsuit, wide leg pants with a nice blouse. A blazer and trouser combo. A tuxedo jacket with tailored slacks. You can pick any of these. Or honestly, if you want to wear jeans and a green sweater, that works, too. It's a wedding, not a runway show. I just want everyone comfortable and having fun. Avery's whole face changed. She actually smiled. You're serious? Completely serious. You could wear sneakers if you want. I don't care. The room went dead quiet. Monica's expression turned into stone. Jason's mom cleared her throat and changed the subject to the cake flavors. Greg just stared at his coffee mug. After they left, Jason pulled me aside. That was really kind of you. He kissed my forehead. Monica's probably going to be upset, though. He was right. Two days later, Jason got a call from Greg. Monica wanted me to make all the bridesmaids wear matching dresses so Avery wouldn't Have a choice. She said it would look uncoordinated in photos if everyone wore different things. She said Avery needed to learn to be more feminine, and this was a good opportunity. Jason told them no. He said it was our wedding and we'd already decided on the dress code. Greg tried arguing, but Jason shut it down fast. Yesterday, Avery sent me a message on Instagram. It was a screenshot of a dark green suit she found online with the caption, is this okay? I wrote back immediately, that's perfect. You're going to look awesome. She sent back three heart emojis, then another message. Thank you for letting me be myself. Monica hasn't spoken to me since that day at the house.

The principal called my name over the intercom. Is Daisy Williams present in school today? My teacher, Mrs. Harra, clicked the intercom button. Yes. The principal's voice echoed, lockdown, now! This is not a drill. The way he said it made my blood freeze. Mrs. Harra shrieked under the desks. Lights off! Move, move, move! Nobody said anything, but everyone was thinking the same thing. There was a shooter. I couldn't help but think he was after me. A few minutes later, we heard sirens and then screaming. Missus Harrah tried to calm us down and told us it might be a misunderstanding, but her hands were shaking. She kept refreshing the email on her laptop like it was giving her live updates. The screaming got louder, and it wasn't just one voice anymore. Multiple people in different parts of the building. Then we heard a loud pop from the hallway, like a metal slamming or something crashing hard. People started crying and whispering that the shooter was right outside. And I believed them. Pia grabbed my hand, and her palms were soaked with sweat. I could see Mister Kids class across the hall through our door window. Lights already off. No movement. Just darkness. Where 20 kids should have been. I looked at our teacher, and for the first time in my life, I saw her cry. She sat with us, hugged the younger kids, and told us it would be okay. But after a while, she Got up again and walked back to her laptop. Then we heard it. Footsteps running past our door. Thud! Thud, thud! I couldn't help myself. I had to look. Two paramedics were sprinting down the hall, pushing a wheeled stretcher, the kind you see on medical shows when someone's heart stops. Get away from the door, Daisy! Missus Harrah whispered, voice shaking. She was scared, too. I sat down and immediately texted everyone what I had seen. Even missus Harrah stood up slowly and crept to the door to check the window before opening it. That's when it flung open. The principal stood there with an actual cop who had his hand resting on his gun. You, Daisy, come with us. Immediately my worst fear confirmed. The tutor had sent them. Or maybe they thought I was involved somehow. Missus Harra looked between them and me, confused. Get your things, honey, missus Harra said. And that scared me more than anything, because in three years of chemistry class, she'd never called me honey. Every single person was staring at me as I grabbed my backpack with shaking hands. The hallway was complete chaos, more cops than I'd ever seen. In one place, I heard a paramedic shout, we're losing him! Move! As he flew past us. My classmates were pressed against the door windows in every room, watching me get escorted by police like I was a criminal. They steered me to the main office, but passed reception into the Conference room. The cop finally spoke. Your dad is here? Well, my parents are divorced, and I hadn't seen him since I was seven. So now I was really confused. Dad? He grabbed me in a hug so tight, I couldn't breathe, and his whole body shook against mine. I'm so sorry, baby. I'm so sorry. My ex marine father, who always encouraged me to be stoic and suppress my feelings, was crying his eyes out. Sorry for what? What's happening? Is there a shooter? Are people dead? I pulled back to look at him, and he held my face in both hands. His hands were freezing. There's no

But this is one of the biggest mooring mistakes you can make, because once that line tightens, it releases an incredible amount of force. If you don't let go at the exact right moment, your hand can get caught in an instant. And don't be fooled by how thick and strong those ropes look. They're trying to stop a ship that weighs tens of thousands of tons. If the rope snaps, it recoils like a whip with enough power to launch a 100 pound object into the air. In dummy tests, the line tore through metal railings and sliced a mannequin clean in half. Now imagine that happening to a real person. To avoid tragedies like this, mooring lines must be replaced regularly, no matter how good they look on the outside. Here's how it works. During docking, crew members throw a thin line with a heavy knot attached. One end of this thin line is tied to the main mooring rope and workers on shore pull the thin line in, dragging the heavy mooring line onto the dock. They secure it to the bollard while the rope is still loose, avoiding any sudden tension. That's how you keep a docking operation safe, smooth and free of disasters.

It started at Thanksgiving when my cousin wouldn't shut up about me being single. She kept asking why I never brought anyone home, making these fake concerned faces at the dinner table. So when she said I must be dating someone special, I just nodded, gave him a name right on the spot. Daniel said he was busy with work. My family ate it up. But then Christmas rolled around, and my mom started asking when she could meet Daniel. My aunt kept texting about setting an extra place at dinner. I was stuck. That's when my roommate Becca suggested her co worker, Daniel, who owed her big time for covering his shifts. She showed me his Instagram. Tall, brown hair, actually decent looking. He agreed to one dinner as a favor. The problem? He didn't just show up and fake smile through dinner. He brought flowers for my mom, asked my dad about his woodworking hobby, and somehow knew my grandmother collected vintage tea cups because I'd mentioned it once when building the fake story. He even laughed at my little brother's terrible jokes about robots. My family was obsessed after that first dinner. My mom kept inviting him back. Easter brunch, my cousin's graduation party, random Sunday dinners. Daniel never said no. He text me beforehand, asking what to bring, if anyone had allergies, stuff like that. He started sending my brother updates about basketball. Scores. My dad asked him to help fix our back porch. The worst part was how natural it felt. We drive to my parents house together, and he'd ask about my day like we actually dated. He remembered my coffee order, knew I hated mushrooms, grab my jacket when I got cold. During family game night, he'd automatically pick me as his partner. We had inside jokes that weren't even planned. One night, after my aunt's birthday party, we sat in his car outside my apartment in complete silence. Everyone had spent the whole night saying how perfect we looked together, how lucky I was. My grandmother even pulled me aside to say Daniel was a keeper. The whole car ride home, I kept stealing glances at him, wondering what he was thinking. I started rehearsing speeches in my bathroom mirror, practice bringing it up casually over coffee. But every time I opened my mouth, nothing came out. How do you tell someone you caught feelings for a fake relationship? Everything changed at Christmas dinner. My aunt announced she'd been looking at wedding venues for us. Said she found the perfect place for next fall. Daniel laughed it off perfectly. Made some joke about her getting ahead of herself. But later that night, he texted me. We can't keep this up forever, you know? That message hit me like a truck. I realized he was ready to end this whole thing. And I wasn't. Not even close. Instead of texting Back or giving him some weird speech? I invited him over for dinner at my place. Cooked his favourite pasta dish. The one my mom always made when he came over. Set the table with actual candles, not just the overhead light. After we finished eating, I was washing dishes and he was drying them. Just like we did at my parents house. That's when I finally said it. I know this.

So I walked away. Two years later, I walked in with someone that left her completely speechless. Britney said no twice. First time at our college graduation. I'm not ready for marriage. I want to travel. Second time, a year later at her birthday. You're sweet, but I need someone more ambitious. That word stung. Ambitious. Like our four years together meant nothing. Two weeks later, she was Instagram official with Logan, my former best friend since high school, trust fund kid with a BMW his daddy bought and a marketing empire that was actually his uncle's firm. They flaunted it everywhere. Expensive restaurants I couldn't afford, designer clothes, constant vacation posts to places I've never seen. Our entire friend group acted like it was destiny, not betrayal. They just make sense together, they'd say. I was crushed. But channeled everything into medical school applications, got massive loans, moved three states away and disappeared into 18 hour study days. No social media, no dating, just pure focus on becoming the surgeon I'd always dreamed of being. While I was killing myself in organic chemistry and anatomy labs, Brittany and Logan were living their best life. Engaged after six months with a ring that cost more than my entire tuition. The wedding was planned for some Vineyard in Napa. Two years into my surgery residency at Children's Hospital, I met Lily at a pediatric trauma conference. She was presenting research on emergency interventions. Brilliant, passionate about Saving kids lives. We talked for hours about everything except medicine. She made me laugh for the first time in years. Eight months of dating before she casually mentioned having an older brother. He's kind of a mess living off our parents at 30, dating this girl who thinks she's too good for everyone. When she said his name was Logan, my blood ran cold. When she showed me his Instagram, there was Britney posing with my replacement life. Wait, Lily said, noticing my reaction. You know them. I told her everything. Instead of being upset, Lily started laughing. Oh, my god, you're that Noah. Britney talks about her boring ex who became a doctor at every family dinner. She has no idea we're together. Logan complains that she keeps comparing him to some guy who actually did something with his life. Fast forward to my little sister's wedding last weekend. Big church ceremony, reception at the country club. Brittany and Logan were invited through mutual friends, small town politics. Lily wore this stunning navy dress that made her look like she belonged in a medical journal success story because she basically did. Youngest head nurse in her department's history. We walked into the reception holding hands. Britney saw me first from across the room. I watched her face change from casual recognition to shock as she realised I look nothing like the broke college kid she remembered. Two years of residency had changed me. Confident, successful, wearing a suit. That actually fit. Then she saw Lily. Her face went from shock to confusion as recognition dawned. She.

My phone buzzed at 2:00am with a text that made me sit straight up in bed. Remember that favor you owe me? I need you to be my boyfriend at my sister's wedding this Saturday. Pick me up at four PM wear navy. It was from Poppy, the girl who saved my entire college career three years ago. I hadn't spoken to her since graduation when I drunkenly promised her anything, anytime, after she spent an entire semester tutoring me through chemistry for free. Without her, I would have lost my scholarship and dropped out. Now she was calling in that favor and honestly, being someone's fake boyfriend for a day seemed like a small price to pay. Plus, if I was being honest with myself, I'd always wondered what it would have been like to actually date her. When I picked her up that Saturday, Poppy answered the door looking absolutely stunning in an emerald dress that made her green eyes even brighter. But her expression was all business. She handed me a typed sheet of paper titled Our Relationship Details with bullet points about our first date, how long we've been together and my supposed favorite things about her. Eight months, she said, adjusting my tie without making eye contact. We've been dating eight months. You call me pop sometimes. We met at a coffee shop. Her voice was mechanical like she was reading a grocery list. During the drive, she Explained the situation. My parents keep trying to set me up with their business partner son at every family event. He's perfectly nice, but I'm just not interested. This will shut them up for a while. The whole ride, she was silent. Then when we arrived at the venue, she took a deep breath, grabbed my hand and suddenly transformed into a completely different person. Ready, babe, she said with a bright smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. The ceremony was beautiful. I caught Poppy wiping her eyes during the vows and without thinking, I handed her my pocket square. She looked surprised but took it, whispering thanks so quietly I almost miss it. During the reception, I found myself forgetting this was an act. Her uncle made a toast. I instinctively put my arm around her shoulders. When the music was too loud to hear her cousin's story, I leaned down so she could whisper it in my ear, her breath warm against my neck. Her grandmother cornered us by the dessert table, pinching my cheeks and telling Poppy in a stage whisper, this one's much better than Adrian. Poppy went rigid at the name, but I squeezed her hand and smoothly changed the subject to Grandma's famous apple pie recipe. Couple's dance was when everything shifted. Poppy was stiff in my arms, counting steps under her breath like she was solving an equation. Hey, I whispered, pulling her closer. Just follow me. Stop thinking so hard, she Looked up at me and for a moment her guard completely dropped. She melted into me, her head finding that perfect spot against my shoulder. We swayed together as the song played and I found myself hoping it would never end. Then during the bouquet toss, she caught it by accident when it bounced off another girl's hands. The crowd cheered, but Poppy immediately handed it to the girl beside her, laughing it off. Just superstition anyway, she said. But I noticed her looking at the flowers longingly as the other girl walked away. Her sister pulled me aside while Poppy was in the bathroom. Thank you, she said, squeezing my arm for making her happy, even if it's just for tonight. The words stuck with me. As the night wound down, I realized I wasn't acting anymore. When I looked at her laughing with her cousins, I felt a pull in my chest that had nothing to do with owing her a favor, driving her home. I couldn't keep it in anymore. Poppy, I know this was just repaying a debt, but tonight felt real to me, really real. She went completely still in the passenger seat when I pulled up to her apartment. She practically jumped out of the car. You did great. Perfect. Fake boyfriend. We're even now. The words came out rushed and cold. She was already at her building's door before I could respond. I sat there for 5 minutes feeling like an idiot before Driving home the next morning, Poppy's sister texted me, you left your.

I pulled over for a hitchhiker on Route 49 because it was starting to rain hard and he looked harmless enough. He got in thanking me and we'd barely gone a mile when the radio interrupted with breaking news. They said a convicted murderer named James Brennan had escaped from the state prison two hours ago during a transfer, killing two guards in the process and was considered extremely dangerous. My passenger whistled and said, wow, that's wild. Two hours ago. He could be anywhere by now. I agreed it was crazy. And we started speculating about how someone would even pull that off during a transfer. He said the guy must have planned it for months, studied the guards routines, waited for the perfect moment. I was impressed by his insight and said he must watch a lot of true crime shows. He laughed and said guilty as charged. He was obsessed with that stuff. We talked about what the guy might have done to get convicted and my passenger said probably something intense if he was willing to kill guards to escape. I said, yeah, you'd have to be pretty desperate. And he said desperation makes people do things they never thought they could do. The rain got heavier and he commented how perfect the weather was for the guy, whoever he was, because rain would wash away tracks and make it harder for dogs to follow. I said I hadn't Thought of that and he explained he used to hunt with his dad, so he knew about tracking. We kept talking about where the escaped guy might go and my passenger said definitely not to family or friends because that's the first place cop.

You have no rights. She forgot the house was built on land with a 99 year lease that expires next month. Jennifer ended our marriage Thursday night with ice cold precision. I'm done, David. I want a divorce. I've already talked to my lawyer. Then she delivered what she thought was the killing blow. I'll be keeping the house and everything in it. You need to pack your stuff and be gone by Sunday. The house, Jen, we've lived here for eight years, built our whole life here. Don't be stupid, she sneered. The house is in my name. The deed, the mortgage, all of it. You have zero legal rights to this property. As she stood there looking so smug and victorious, I felt this strange calm wash over me. She was absolutely right. The house was 100% in her name. But Jennifer had always been careless about paperwork. She'd forgotten one tiny detail buried in the property documents. Three years ago, I was working as a city planning assistant. Part of my job was reviewing old property records and lease agreements. That's when I discovered something interesting about our neighborhood. Most people don't know this, but some residential areas in our city were built on land that the original developers leased, not bought outright. Our house sits on one of those plots, a 99 year ground lease that started in 1925 when we bought the house. Eight years ago, I noticed it in the fine print. The lease expires February 15th, 2025. That's exactly three weeks from today. I tried to explain it to Jennifer back then, but she was too excited about getting the house to listen. Whatever, David, just handle the boring legal stuff. I don't care about ancient lease agreements. So I handled it. I contacted the original land owners estate and negotiated renewal terms. They agreed to sell me the land outright for $180,000, but only if I exercised the option before the lease expired. I've been saving for three years, putting aside money for my promotion without telling Jennifer. She thought I was just being cheap when I suggested we skip expensive vacations. You're right, I told her, my voice completely hollow. It's your house. I'll be packed and gone by Saturday. The relief and triumph on her face was something I'll never forget. She actually looked happy that she was destroying our marriage. I spent Friday packing, acting completely defeated. She watched me with this peeing look, probably thinking about how she'd finally gotten rid of dead weight me. She had no clue what was about to hit her. Saturday morning, I called Morrison and Associates, the law firm handling the estate. This is David Walsh. I'd like to exercise my option to purchase the land at 47 Maple street before the lease expires. The lawyer was surprised. Mr Walsh, that's cutting it close. The lease expires February 15th. If someone doesn't purchase By then, all structures on the property revert to the estate. I understand I have the $180,000 ready to transfer today within two hours. I own the land underneath Jennifer's house. Monday, Jennifer got served papers from Morrison and Associates. The ground lease for her property had expired.

She also recorded a video message that she insisted be played at this reading. She turned the laptop around and pressed play. Mom appeared on screen, looking thin and tired, but her eyes were fierce. She said, if you're watching this, I'm dead. And I'm sure Kevin is losing his absolute mind right now. Kevin's mouth fell open. Mom smiled and said, Kevin, sweetie, let me tell you a story. You visited me exactly 37 times in five years. I kept to list in my nightstand with dates. Every single visit, you asked me for money. 15,000 for your kitchen because you couldn't stand your old countertops. 8,000 for your wife's car. 12,000 for dental work. 5,000 for a vacation to Hawaii. Shall I continue? Kevin's face went from red to white. Mom said, last month you came over needing seven thousand dollars for new furniture because your old couch had a stain. You brought the kids and they sat on their devices the entire time without speaking to me. Not one word. You gave me your little speech about money being tight, and the second I handed you the cheque, you were out the door. My aunt gasped. Mom kept going and her voice got louder. My daughter called me every single Sunday at exact, please, seven PM for five years straight. She never missed one. Not when she had the Flu? Not when she was traveling for work. She asked about every single doctor appointment and every medication change. She flew home six times when I had surgeries and procedures, sleeping in hospital chairs and using all her vacation time. Tears were pouring down my face. Mom said, two years go, I accidentally found out your sister has been paying my medical bills. She never told me. She never asked for anything back. She never even mentioned it. Meanwhile, Kevin, you asked me for money 37 times and never paid back a single dollar. Kevin tried to speak, but nothing came out. Mom said, so, Kevin, you get absolutely nothing. Not one penny. Not because I stopped loving you, but because you stopped loving me the second I couldn't write you checks anymore. Your sister gets everything because she's the only one who loved me without a price tag attached. I hope you learn something from this. But honestly, you're too much of a selfish prick to change. The video ended. Kevin screamed at me and his wife had to drag him out. He contested the will and lost every appeal. I live in Mom's house now.

Then I found out why they were hiding it. I'm white, married to David, whose family only speaks Mandarin at home. I studied abroad and aging for three years, but I never mentioned it. I figured I'd tell them eventually, just never found the right moment. For two years, I listen to everything, every dinner, every holiday, every family gathering. His mom would smile at me, then turn to his aunts and say things like she's too skinny to carry a healthy baby or American girls don't know how to be proper wives. His grandmother once said I looked tired and weak right to my face in English, told the family and Mandarin that I probably couldn't get pregnant because I was too stressed from working. I'd go home after those dinners and cry in the shower where David couldn't hear me. I'd scrub my skin until it was red trying to wash off the feeling of being examined like livestock. Every family gathering felt like an inspection. I was failing. They touch my arms, pinch my waist and whisper to each other about my body like I wasn't even there. The worst part, I started believing them. I'd stand in front of the mirror pulling at my skin, wondering if they were right. Maybe I was too thin, too weak, too American. Maybe I wasn't good enough to be David's wife. I almost told him so many times, but What would I say? Your mom thinks I'm defective. He loved his family. He'd grown up with Sunday dinners and holidays, surrounded by aunts and uncles who adored him. I didn't want to be the wife who drove a wedge between him and the people who raised him. So I smiled. I Learned to make dumplings the way his grandmother liked. I wore the Jade bracelet his mother gave me, even though I'd heard her tell his aunt it was cheap, a test to see if I knew the difference. When I finally got pregnant, I thought things would change. I thought maybe they'd soften except me. But it got so much worse. Sister told everyone I was definitely having a girl because I was carrying wrong and that girls are disappointments. His mom said she'd pray I'd have a boy so David wouldn't leave me. She said it while setting the table, casual as asking about the weather. His aunt laughed and said, at least if it's a girl, maybe the second one will be a boy. Second one. Like I was a machine, like my only value was what I could produce. I had terrible morning sickness, spent weeks barely able to keep water down. David's mom brought soup to our house and I was so grateful I actually cried. Then I overheard her on the phone with his aunt saying she made the soup because the baby needs nutrients even if the mother is too weak to Eat properly. Not because she cared about me, because she cared about her grandchild. That night, I sat on our bathroom floor at 2 a. M. Holding my stomach and I made a decision. I was.

My girlfriend Bianca is a model. I'm an accountant. When she agreed to a second date, my brother literally asked if I was paying her. Eight months in, everything was perfect. She was funny, spontaneous. Literally everything a man dreams of. We'd stay up talking until 3:00am. She'd surprise me at work with lunch. Made me feel like I was the only guy in the world. Then I moved into her place. Little things started changing. The way she'd phrase questions that weren't really questions. How her suggestions felt less like suggestions. Still perfect on the surface, but the way she looked at me was different. Then Christmas morning changed everything. We're opening gifts in bed and she hands me this perfectly wrapped box with a huge smile. Inside is a leather looking dog collar with Bianca's engraved on a silver tag. We both burst out laughing. For when you're being a bad boy, she joked, kissing me. I tossed the gag gift in the closet with the ugly sweater my mom sent. A week later, she's making dinner when she brings it up. You never wear my gift. Her voice is flat and serious. I laugh, thinking she's joking, but she's not. I put thought into that. You obviously don't care about what I give you. She locks herself in the bedroom. Two hours of silence. I knock on the door, she screams, just admit You don't love me. After hours of me waiting outside the bathroom, she comes out, eyes red. You really thought my gift was a joke? I wore it that night just to make her happy. The smile that spread across her face was worth the weirdness. Good boy, she said, running her fingers along the leather. Something in her tone made my stomach turn. But she was happy again, affectionate again. That's all that mattered. Next. Hey. I get home from work and she immediately freezes. Where's your collar? Like asking where my watch was. I laugh it off, thinking she's joking, but she's genuinely upset. You only wear it when I force you. That's what I mean to you. The guilt hits different when someone you love thinks you don't care. So I put it on. Comes routine walk in, collar on. Small price for peace. I thought it would only be a temporary thing that she would forget about after a few weeks. Then two weeks in, she starts saying good boy constantly. When I'd bring her coffee, when I'd agree with her, when I'd put the collar on without being asked, I mention it. Feels weird. It's just cute. She says, don't you want to be my good boy? The way she asks, like saying no. Feel like saying I don't love her. Then the commands start. I'm heading to the kitchen for dinner. Sit, she says from the couch. I freeze. What? Sit here next to Me. Her tone is playful, but her eyes aren't. I sit confused. Good boy. My skin crawls. Later, I'm making my plate. Did I say you could eat yet? She's not joking. Beg for it. I laugh nervously. She doesn't. I'm serious. Beg or don't eat. I stand there, plate in hand, calculating if this is the hill to die on. My stomach. My growls, please can I eat? She smiles. Good boy. I start documenting everything in my phone. The commands get worse. Stay when I try to leave arguments. Speak when she wants me to agree with

My mother in law was crying, and my father in law kept saying, she's beautiful. She looks just like you. They stayed with me for hours, taking turns holding the baby and bringing me water and telling me what an amazing mother. I Was going to be around 6 that evening. My parents walked into the hospital room. They were loud and laughing, and I could smell wine on them. From across the room. My mom saw the baby in my mother in law's arms, and her whole face changed. She rushed over and said, oh my god, let me hold her. She took the baby and stared at her and started crying. She said, she's perfect. Look at her little hands. I can't believe I'm a grandmother. My dad came over and looked at the baby and his eyes got wet. He said, she's beautiful.

You chose Natalie's party. My dad said, we didn't realize the baby would be here already. We thought we had time. My father in law stood up and said, you need to leave. My mom clutched the baby tighter and said, we just got here. We want to spend time with our granddaughter. I said, give her back to her grandmother and pointed at my mother in law. My mom's face crumpled and she handed the baby over. I said, you chose a housewarming party over your daughter's life threatening surgery and the birth of your first grandchild. You showed up six hours late, drunk and You want me to believe you care now? My dad said, please, we made a mistake. We want to be in her life. I said get out. My mom tried to take a photo of the baby before leaving and my father in law deleted it from her phone. They haven't seen her since.

When I finally got myself a house, they wanted me to give it to her and move back in with them, paying only half the rent. When I was 16, my parents called a family meeting. I thought maybe they'd help me open a bank account. Instead, they told me I'd be paying $300 monthly rent to teach me real world responsibility. I was making eight dollars and fifty cents an hour at Burger King, working 20 hours a week. They wanted half my paycheck for the bedroom I had since I was 5, the one with the broken closet door they never fixed. My sister Olivia was 14. When I asked if she'd pay rent, too, my dad actually laughed. Your sister's situation is dead, friend. Olivia never paid a cent, not at 16, not at 18, not even after she dropped out of college. She lived rent free until she was 28 years old. Meanwhile, I couldn't do sports or hang out with friends. I worked, went to school and paid rent. When I got an offender Bender at 17, completely the other driver's fault, my parents made me pay the 500 dollar deductible. When Olivia totaled Mom's car at 19 doing donuts in a parking lot, they bought her a newer car and called it a learning experience. I paid for my own prom. Olivia went to three proms at school. She didn't. Even attend my parents covered dresses, hair, makeup, limo, everything. Christmas I got.

I teach 10th grade English at a public school in Ohio. Three weeks into the fall semester, one of my brightest students, Evan, stopped showing up to class. He'd been getting straight A's. Always participate. The kind of kid who actually did the reading. When he came back two weeks later, the school counselor, Miss Inguyen, pulled me aside in the hallway. Devon's father passed away suddenly. Heart attack. He's having a really rough time. Just wanted to give you a heads up. I waited until after class that day and pulled Devon aside. Hey. I heard about your dad. I'm really sorry. Listen, don't worry about any of the work you missed. We already took the state exam, so as far as I'm concerned, you're done with the requirements. Just focus on getting through your other classes and taking care of yourself. He nodded, didn't say much. I could see he was barely holding it together. For the next two months, Devon showed up to my class every day. He did every assignment I gave, even though I told him he didn't have to. Solid E+ 1. Not as usual A's, but considering everything, I was just glad he was functioning. Then, in early December, I got an email from his Nguyen asking me to attend a meeting about Devon. I checked my grade book. He was doing fine in my class, so I had no idea what This was about. I walked into the counselor's office and saw four other teachers sitting there. Missus Harrington from history, Mister Lopez from math, Missus Lynn from science, and Coach Davidson, who taught health. Miss Inguyen started the meeting. Devon is failing four out of six classes. He's in danger of repeating the entire year. The only classes he's passed sing our English and PE. I wanted to bring everyone together to figure out a plan. Missus Harrington jumped in immediately. He's missed over twenty assignments in my class. I told him he could make up ten of them, but he hasn't turned in a single one. At a certain point, we have to hold students accountable. Mr. Lopez nodded. Same situation in math. He won't stay after school for tutoring. Won't ask for help. Just sits there. I looked at Miss Minion. What exactly did you want my input on? He's doing fine in my class. Missus Harrington turned to me, clearly annoyed. That's exactly the problem. You're enabling him. I don't see why we even needed you here. You just let the kids skip out on work. That's not helpful. That's not teaching. The room got quiet. I leaned forward. His dad died eight weeks ago. You really think 20 history worksheets about the French Revolution matter to him right now? Structure matters. Missus Harrington said, these kids need to learn that life doesn't stop just because something bad happens. That's a valuable lesson. He's 16. I said, He just lost his father. The valuable lesson he's learning right now is that half his teachers care more about their grade books than his dead parent. Coach Davidson shifted uncomfortably. Mister Lopez stared at his hands. Missus Harrington's face went red. That's completely unfair. I offered him extensions. The door opened. Devon walked in. He wasn't supposed to be there, but Miss Nguyen had clearly texted him to come down without telling the rest of us. Missus white Harrington didn't notice him standing by the door. She kept going. These kids need to understand that grief doesn't excuse laziness. My mother died when I was in college, and I still graduated on time. Devin stood there for a second. Then he spoke, his voice completely calm.

Victoria Ashford cornered me by my locker after chemistry class, looking more nervous than I'd ever seen her. She was the queen bee of our school, the girl who made freshman cry with a single glance and had never spoken to me except to ask me to move out of her way. I need a favor, she said quietly, glancing around to make sure no one could hear. I almost laughed. Victoria Ashford needed something from me. What kind of favor, I asked. Closing my locker, she took a deep breath. I need you to pretend to be my boyfriend at my family reunion this weekend. I'll pay you $200. My brain struggled to process this. Why me and why do you need a fake boyfriend? Her usual confidence cracked slightly. Because you're believable and I may have told my family I've been dating someone for the past year. Story came out in fragments. Victoria's family was obsessed with her personal life, constantly asking about boyfriends and when she'd settle down. Her cousins were all married or engaged and she was tired of being in the single disappointment. I invented a boyfriend to get them off my back. Described him as smart, quiet, studious. Sound familiar? I realized she'd essentially described me to her entire extended family. I should have said no immediately. Victoria had made my sophomore year miserable, spreading rumors. That I was too weird to date anyone. She'd laughed when I asked Melissa to prom and got rejected. But something in her desperation made me curious. What exactly would I have to do? She pulled out her phone and showed me pictures from previous family gatherings. Just hold my hand, smile, answer basic questions about our relationship. Easy acting job. The reunion was at her grandmother's estate outside the city. Victoria picked me up Saturday morning and during the drive, she coached me on our fake relationship. We met in AP history. You asked me to study for the midterm. I said yes because you're surprisingly funny when you're not being awkward. I noticed she'd memorized specific details. Our first date was mini golf. My favorite movie was apparently The Princess Bride. I'd given her a necklace for our six month anniversary. When we arrived, Toria transformed. She introduced me to aunts, uncles and cousins with genuine enthusiasm. Her hand naturally finding mine. This is Daniel, my boyfriend I've been telling you about. Her family welcomed me warmly, asking about my college plans, my hobbies, what I liked about Victoria. The answers came easier than expected because Victoria had crafted our fake relationship around real details about my life. During dinner, Victoria's grandmother pulled me aside. That girl has been different this past year, happier, more confident. Good for her. I looked across the room where Victoria was laughing with her little cousins and something clicked. She seemed genuinely Relaxed here, not performing or calculating like at school. She talks about you constantly. Her grandma. They continued. Daniel said this. Daniel thinks that I was beginning to wonder if you were real. The weirdest part was how natural everything felt. Victoria leaned against me during family photos, whispered jokes about her relatives in my ear, even fell asleep with her head on my shoulder during her uncle's endless slide show. When her cousin asked how we knew we were right for each other, Victoria answered without hesitation, he sees the real me, not the version everyone expects, just me. That evening, walking around her grandmother's garden, Victoria was.

My husband accidentally left his phone open on the bathroom counter last Tuesday. And what I saw completely shattered me. He'd been scrolling through old photos of me, like old, old photos from three years ago when I was 60 pounds heavier. I just stood there staring at the screen, feeling my stomach drop. Photo after photo of me at my heaviest, me in stretched out leggings and an oversized hoodie trying to hide my body. Me with my double chin at someone's backyard barbecue holding a burger I probably felt guilty about later. Me squeezing into a bridesmaid dress that barely zipped my arms, looking massive in those cap sleeves. I felt, felt sick, like actually nauseous. Was this what he did when I wasn't around? Look at my before pictures and what? Laugh. Compare them to now. Feel relieved I finally got my act together. When he came back from the garage, I was still holding his phone, my hand shaking. What is this? My voice came out way shakier than I wanted. He looked at the screen and his whole face just collapsed. Babe, I can explain. Explain what? That you've been looking at the worst photos of me. I could feel tears starting to burn behind my eyes. Do you know how hard I've worked? I meal prep every single Sunday. I'm at the gym at 5 a. M.

Six months earlier, my parents called me home for something important. Dad had a folder laid out. We are refinancing the house, he said. Just a simple signature. Something in me tensed. I took the folder to my lawyer. She called me the next morning. This isn't a refinance. It's a transfer of liability. If you sign, you're responsible for their debt. Debt, a second mortgage, months of missed payments for closure letters. They were drowning and looking for someone to drag under with them. Two months later, dad called asking for money. He said it was for Mom's medical bills. When I offered to pay the hospital directly, he crumbled. The truth spilled out. Late payments, deadlines, desperation. They weren't giving Jenna the house. They were giving her the debt. And they expected me to sit quietly while it happened. A week before Thanksgiving, Mom called gushing about how excited Jenna was to host more often once things were settled with the house. That night, I pulled property records, foreclosure notices and overdue statement.

She pointed at the kid who hadn't seen Dragon Ball. Back to class. She just called Dexter an idiot. And the principal didn't even flinch. Whatever happened had to have been really serious. Teacher continued, who here has seen Naruto? Two more kids lowered their Hands. You two leave seven of us left now. I looked at John. He was pale. Hands gripping his knees. Who here has seen one piece? Three kids shook their heads out. Just five of us now. Me.

My uncle had passed away after battling cancer for five years. Today was the will reading of his estate. In the ordinance with this final will and testimony, you are allotted $3 million in the beach house in Beverly Hills. Greg, you are also allotted $3 million in the little ranch in Texas. My siblings were sitting there like proud peacocks as they heard what Uncle Tim had left them. Jacob, you were given the dinner in Florida along with the condo there. My siblings instantly burst into laughter. Little Jacob still has to work for his money. So sad that you can't borrow my millions, Greg taunted viciously. Don't worry, Jacob, I'm sure you will find ways to make money. Working hard and all that, Chrissy stated with an evil smirk as she waved her hand at me. I couldn't help but scowl at Chrissy and Greg. I would have been happier if Uncle Tim was still alive, but I kept my mouth shut. This concludes the reading and distribution of your uncle's estate. Finally, I can take a vacation, Chrissy flaunted. I stood up and snap to the pair. I bet you lose everything Uncle Tim gave you both in under a month. I slammed the door on my way out. Uncle Tim and I used to always get together at his diner. We could talk for hours about our lives.

Today, 365 days. I know because I marked it on the calendar this morning. A full year of living with two other people and not saying a single word to either of them. It started over something stupid. My son Greg was 17, and he got caught vaping in the school bathroom. The principal called me at work, and I had to leave early to pick him up. When we got home, my husband Dan was already there because he works from home doing IT stuff. I told Dan what happened, and he just shrugged. Said, boys will be boys. Said he did worse at that age. I lost it. Told him he was a terrible parent. He told me I was overreacting. I stood there smirking like the whole thing was funny. Then Dan said the thing that made me snap. He said, maybe if I spent less time worrying about Greg's business and more time making this house feel like a home, Greg wouldn't be acting out. I walked upstairs, went into the guest room, and shut the door. I decided right then I was done talking to both of them. Not yelling, not explaining. Just done. The first week was the hardest. Dan kept knocking on the guest room door, asking what my problem was. I ignored him. Greg tried once, said, sorry, mom, through the door, but It sounded fake. I stayed quiet.

Hollis, nobody's in my backyard at night. But I see him every night at midnight from my bedroom window. He's real, I promise. My heart pounded. What does he look like? Really tall, wearing dark clothes. He stands there for, like, an hour without moving that night. I stayed up watching my backyard until almost one in the morning. Nothing. No one there. But the next morning, I found huge footprints behind my shed. Size 13, maybe bigger. The prints were deep, like someone heavy had stood there for a long time. They were fresh from last night. I took photos with my shaking hands. I called the police. Officer Grayson came and looked around. Your gates are locked. No signs of breaking. Install some cameras just in case. I put up two cameras that night. But my phone died at 11:38 and I forgot to charge it. When I got it working again after midnight, I checked what the cameras had recorded. At exactly midnight, a tall figure walked into view. Incredibly tall, wearing a long, dark coat. It walked to my shed, stopped and stood completely still, facing my house. For 43 minutes. It didn't move at all. Then it walked. Backward and disappeared. I called Officer Grayson right away. He came back.

My son has autism, so bringing him to my cousin's wedding felt like bringing a loaded gun with the safety off because with his autism comes this brutal honesty that terrifies me in social situations. Last month at our family barbecue, he walked up to his aunt and said, Auntie, I have a question for you. When she encouraged him to continue, he said, I thought healthy food was supposed to make you skinnier, but you always talk about how your diet is so good and you're the fattest person I know. She turned so red with embarrassment she had to go home. Don't get me wrong, I found it extremely funny. If anything, he made everything better. But sometimes his bravery scared me. So before the wedding, I sat him down in the parking lot and tried to negotiate with him like he was a government official. Remember what we talked about? Sometimes our thoughts need to stay in our heads. His little face scrunched up the way it does when he's processing something important. But what if someone's being mean to you, dad? The protective tone in his voice made my chest tight with love. Then we'll handle it together, okay? But let's try to keep quiet today. We pinky promised and that was enough for me to believe him when we went inside. The ceremony went better. Than I expect. My son sat still, only stimming with his fingers during the vows, which made my heart swell with pride for how far he'd come since I adopted him. I kept stealing glances at him, being scared that he would break our promise and announce that the best man had food in his teeth or that someone's baby looked angry, but he didn't say anything. I actually started to relax, thinking maybe we'd make it through without an incident. But then came the wedding reception. My cousin.

This is one of Japan's largest liquid egg factories, where millions of eggs are cracked every day. Each morning, workers transfer eggs from cold storage to the processing plant. First, the eggs are placed in a water tank to start the cleaning process, removing dirt and bacteria. Any eggs that float to the surface are discarded, while the ones that pass the test are pushed onto a conveyor belt heading to the egg cracking machine. Here, the eggs are cracked automatically and quickly, and the shells are separated onto another conveyor, where they're collected and later used as organic fertilizer. The egg contents are then automatically separated into three parts, egg whites, yolks and whole egg mix. Next, the liquid egg is pumped through pipes into specialized storage tanks for sterilization and preservation at 2 degrees Celsius. After that, it's time for packaging and labeling, where the liquid egg is automatically pumped into bags or large containers, depending on customer needs.

I sighed. Gail was my neighbor and just so happened to be the most popular boy in school. And since I was more of a quiet girl, the type to choose studying for a test over hanging out with friends I didn't have, he always felt safe coming to me for weird favors. He knew I wouldn't judge him. Just last week, he texted me a photo of his armpit, asking if the deodorant stain was visible before his presentation. So now asking me to cut him out of a Halloween costume in between classes didn't even feel that weird. What classroom are you in? I asked. 3B. He responded instantly. I walked to the classroom with a pair of Scissors I had from an art class. As soon as he heard my footsteps, he laughed awkwardly, his handsome green eyes shining through the costume. Thank you so much for coming. This is so embarrassing. I rolled my eyes, fighting back my smile. It's fine. Not like it's anything new. He was wearing a ridiculous inflatable green crayon costume, except it was now completely deflated and he couldn't get it off. I tried cutting, but the Scissors barely made a dent. It's like reinforced with wire or something, I muttered. As I got closer, I got a whiff of that Cologne he always wears and butterflies. Raced in my stomach, I tried to suppress my crush on him by reminding myself he had a girlfriend, Chelsea, the most popular girl in school, blonde, pretty. She was everything I wasn't. But suppressing my crush didn't really work because that's when he joked. You're breathing really fast. Am I making you nervous? Maybe we can just pull it off, I suggested, ignoring the butterflies that filled my stomach worth a shot. His eyes met mine through the mesh window of the car.

We both clapped when Greg's name was called. Afterwards, Greg tried to get us together for a photo. He stood between us and put his arms around both our shoulders. The photographer took it. We all smiled. Then we went to separate cars and drove home separately, even though we live in the same house. Month 11, I got sick, some kind of flu that knocked me out for a week. I stayed in the guest room with the door closed. Every morning I'd wake up and there'd be a tray outside the door with soup and crackers and orange juice. Dan never knocked, just left it there. I ate it and put the tray back outside. When I was done, he take it away, never said a word.

She asked about every single Doctor appointment and every medication change. She flew home six times when I had surgeries and procedures, sleeping in hospital chairs and using all her vacation time. Tears were pouring down my face. Mom said, two years to go. I accidentally found out your sister has been paying my medical bills. She never told me. She never asked for anything back. She never even mentioned it. Meanwhile, Kevin, you asked me for money 37 times and never paid back a single dollar. Kevin tried to speak, but nothing came out. Mom said, so, Kevin, you get absolutely nothing. Not one penny. Not because I stopped loving you, but because you stopped loving me the second I couldn't write you checks anymore. Your sister gets everything because she's the only one who loved me without a price tag attached. I hope you learn something from this. But honestly, you're too much of a selfish prick to change. The video ended. Kevin screamed at me and his wife had to drag him out. He contested the will and lost every appeal. I live in Mom's house now.

Everyone else, sit down. Three kids sat down on the left side. This was getting weird, but we kept following along because what else were we supposed to do? Right side. Anyone who walks to school, move to the back of the room. Me and 4 other kids moved to the back. I was starting to feel uncomfortable. Why did she need to know this stuff? Back row. Anyone who stops at the corner store on Maple Street before school, stay standing. Just me and Kaylee were left standing. My heart started beating faster. Kaylee, sit down. If you go there on Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kaylee sat down. I was the only one left standing in the back corner of the room. The substitute teacher stared at me for a long moment, then smiled. Perfect. Everyone return to your normal seats. We all moved back, confused and whispering to each other. She started teaching math like nothing happened, but I couldn't focus. Why did she need to know my exact routine? At lunch, I told my friends about how creepy it was. George said maybe she was just doing some weird icebreaker activity. But Emma pointed out She never even told us her name. When we got back from lunch, the substitute was gone. Principal Hilton was there instead, looking serious.

I'm driving now. Good luck. I'm so sorry. I ran out of the conference room and drove home going 90 miles per hour. My hands were shaking so bad, I could barely hold the steering wheel. I pulled up our ring camera app while at a red light. What I saw made me scream. The footage showed my seven year old Molly and five year old Carl being dragged out of the house by their hair. They were screaming and crying as someone threw them into a silver sedan. I couldn't see the person's face, but they were wearing all black. I called 9 1 1 immediately. My children were kidnapped from my house. I have video, ma'am. When did this happen? Maybe 20 minutes ago. The babysitter abandoned them. We're dispatching units now. Can you describe the vehicle? Silver sedan, four doors. I couldn't see the plates. I called my husband, Ivan, who was on a business trip in Dallas. He answered on the first ring. The kids were taken from the house. I screamed. That stupid babysitter left them alone and someone took them. What? What do you mean, taken? Kidnapped, Ivan. Someone dragged them out by their hair. He started crying. Immediately, which made me even angrier. I needed him to help, not fall apart. I'm getting on the next flight, he sobbed. Just get here. I hung up and sat in my driveway, watching police search my house. They kept asking about enemies or custody disputes. We didn't have any. Then I thought about someone who'd want my kids. I called my mother. We hadn't spoken in three years after I caught her hitting Molly for spilling juice. She'd abused me my whole childhood, and I wasn't letting her near my kids. Linda, she answered, surprised. Is everything okay? Mom, someone took Molly and Carl. Oh, my god, that's terrible. I'll come help search right away. You will? Of course. They're my grandchildren.

I like staying at my dad's place way more, but my mom threw this huge fit when I asked to live there full time, so I just dropped it to make things easier. Three years ago, my mom started dating this guy, Dan, and they got married this year and has two kids who live with him full time because their mom isn't around. There's Ty, who's 12, and Amy, who's 15. Ty is pretty chill. He mostly keeps to himself unless you get him talking about dinosaurs or something. But Amy is the most annoying person I've ever met. They're both autistic, but in totally different ways. Ty just wants to be left alone with his books, and that's fine. Amy is constantly in my face about everything. She follows me around the house, interrupts me when I'm on the phone with friends, and asks a million questions about stuff I'm doing. The worst part is I have to share a room with her until they finish the basement, which they keep saying will be done soon, but it's been like, eight months. Amy doesn't have any friends at school, so my mom and Dan have been trying to force her into my friend group. At first. First it was just little Suggestions like why don't you bring Amy along? When I was meeting up with friends at the mall. But then it got worse. Amy started crying to my mom because I wouldn't let her sit with me and my friends at lunch. So now my mom made this rule that if I wanna see my friends during her week, Amy has to come. My friends absolutely hate it. She talks over everyone, shares random fact.

I had this bathroom pass system where students got three passes per semester, and if you ran out, you were stuck holding it during class. It worked perfectly at first, but then second semester, this kid Derek started asking to use the bathroom every single day. I reminded him he was out of passes completely since mid January, and he said he knew, said he just hold it. But the next day, he asked again, and I said no. And he just sat back down with no complaints. Just went right back to his work like nothing happened. This pattern continued for six straight weeks, where every single day, Derek would raise his hand and ask for the bathroom. I'd say no and reference the pass policy. He just accept it and go back to work without arguing or making any kind of scene. I started thinking he was just testing my boundaries, trying to wear me down until I'd eventually cave and let him go. But he stayed completely polite the entire time. Then one Tuesday, the principal called me into her office with weird expression on her face, half amused and half genuinely concerned, and she asked if I knew that Eric had been leaving my classroom every single day for the past two months. I actually laughed out loud and told her that was impossible because I never gave him a bathroom pass. Not even once. She Turned her monitor toward me and pulled up security footage from outside my classroom door. Started playing it back from February and the footage showed Derek walking out of my room with the time stamp reading one forty seven PM. Right in the middle of my fifth period class. She fast forwarded to the next day and same thing. Derek walking out at the same exact time. And she kept going through day after day, where every single day showed the same pattern of Derek leaving during fifth period, always around the same time. I sat there completely confused because there was no way I wouldn't have noticed a student just walking out in the middle of my lesson. I would have seen him get up and walk to the door and stopped him before he even reached it. The principal could see my confusion, so she rewind the footage and played it in real time to let me watch second by second. The camera showed Derek sitting at his desk in the back corner and he raised his hand high and I watched myself.

The morning of my C section, my mother in law and father in law were at the hospital by 7, even though we didn't need to be there until eleven. They brought me breakfast and sat with me while I filled out paperwork. My mother in law held my hand and told me how proud she was of me. They were in the waiting area. When they took me back for surgery, everything went wrong. My blood pressure dropped and the baby's heart rate was all over the place. I. I hear the doctors talking in urgent voices and see the nurses moving fast. They got the baby out, but she wasn't crying. For 10 seconds. That felt like 10 hours. There was just silence. Then she screamed and I started sobbing. They brought her over and put her on my chest, and she was perfect. In recovery, my in laws were waiting with flowers and balloons. My mother in law was crying and my father in law kept saying, she's beautiful. She looks just like you. They stayed with me for hours, taking turns holding the baby and bringing me water, telling me what an amazing mother I was going to be. Around 6 that evening, my parents walked into the hospital room. They were loud and laughing and I could smell wine on them from across the room. My mom saw the baby in my mother in law's arms and her whole face changed. She rushed over and said, oh my god, let me hold her. She took the baby and stared at her and started crying. She said, she's perfect. Look at her little hands. I can't believe I'm a grandmother. My dad came over and looked at the baby and his eyes got wet. He said, she's beautiful. She looks like you did when you were born. My mom turned to me and said, why didn't you tell us it was happening now? We would have been here. I stared at her. I said, I told you two weeks ago you chose Natalie's party. My dad said, we didn't realize the baby would be here already. We. We had time. My father in law stood up and said, you need to leave. My mom clutched the baby tighter and said, we just got here. We want to spend time with our granddaughter. I said, give her back to her grandmother and pointed at my mother in law. My mom's face crumpled and she handed the baby over. I said, you chose a house warming party over your daughter's life threatening surgery and the birth of your first grandchild.

And when I got straight A's, my parents put her C minus report card on the fridge and stuck mine in a drawer. I stopped expecting anything from them years ago. When I got pregnant, I called my parents to tell them they were going to be grandparents for the first time. My mom said, that's nice, honey, and then spent 20 minutes telling me about the house Natalie he was buying. Throughout my pregnancy, they asked how I was feeling exactly twice, but Natalie's house became the only thing they could talk about. Every conversation was about her new countertops or her backyard or her paint colors. My mother in law threw me a baby shower and my parents showed up 30 minutes late and left early because they were helping Natalie pick out furniture. My due date got moved up and the doctor scheduled a C section because the baby was breech. I called my parents and told them the date and time. My mom said, oh, we'll definitely be there. This is our first grandbaby. For the first time in my life, I felt like maybe they were finally going to show up for me. My mother in law was so excited she started crying when I Told her the C section date. She bought an outfit specific for meeting her first grandchild and had been texting me every day asking how I was feeling. My father in law took the whole week off work so he could help us when we brought the baby home. Two weeks before the C section, my mom called and said, so we have a little situation. Natalie scheduled her housewarming party for the same day as your C section. She sent out invitations months ago, and she really. He wants us there. I felt my entire chest tightened. I said she knew when my C section was scheduled. My mom said, I know, but this party is really important to her. She's worked so hard on this house. We'll come by the hospital after if we can. I said, if you can. She said, the party starts at 2 and you're scheduled for noon. So we'll probably still be at Natalie's, but we'll try to stop by that evening.

When they got to wherever these guys lived, he parked my car in a bus stop. A literal no parking zone in downtown Vancouver. The car got towed. I was so angry, I could barely speak. But Amy acted like this was all totally fine. She kept saying she didn't do anything wrong because she wasn't the one who parked the car.

The keys to my car, my home, everything were just gone with some random guy. She said she had to lie about the family dinner because I don't like going to clubs. Like that justified everything. I told her to pack her Stuff she needed to be out. By the end of the week, Amy completely lost it. Started crying and calling me heartless. And she called her family, and they all started blowing up my phone, saying I was being cruel and overreacting. Her mom said I should be more understanding because Amy made a mistake. A mistake?

They would receive an extra $2 an hour per mouth certification. The president barely looked up from the papers he was reviewing. He agreed immediately, assuming none of us would bother. He also assumed it wasn't even possible to get meaningful certifications before summer began. He didn't know coach very well. Coach spent his entire career building the county's rescue and training network. He personally trained half the instructors, helped hire most of the town's emergency responders in their younger years, and had ties to every training program in the region. All he had to do was make a few phone calls. Within a week, the county's top instructors, examiners and emergency trainers were rotating through the beach club, offering accelerated certifications. Many of them waived every fee, happy for a chance to repay coach for decades of support. We weren't just getting the basics trained for everything. We renewed CPR. We got open water and deep water rescue certifications. We became certified swim instructors. We got food safety training for the club kitchen. We earned county pool operator licenses. We became sanitation certified. A few of us even got scuba certifications through the county's water rescue team. By Memorial Day weekend, the unofficial start of summer, every single lifeguard was stacked with credentials. Because of the agreement, our minimum wage pay shot upward fast. I went from the forced five dollars and fifteen cents minimum wage at the time to $27 an hour by The time the list of certifications was tallied, when the president finally noticed the payroll numbers, his reaction was exactly what you'd expect. But he had signed the agreement and coach made sure it was all documented. Probably there was nothing he could undo without causing a much bigger problem for the board. A month later, he resigned, claiming he wanted to spend more time enjoying the beach. He didn't spend time at our beach again. New president worked with coach instead of fighting him and several experienced staff members returned the next year. A few weeks ago, I heard that coach passed away peacefully at 91. True to who he was, he was still around the beach, still moving, still getting in his daily rowing sessions. Even at the end, he stayed active, involved and committed to the place and people he loved. He really was one of a kind.

So I kept going. But I started playing differently. I stopped trying to win and just focused on not getting hurt. Tyler noticed immediately and got even rougher. He started tackling me when our parents weren't looking, then helping me up before they turned around. He'd throw elbows during corner kicks and claim it was accidental contact. The worst part was he'd get this look on his face right before he did something, like he was enjoying it. Three weeks before soccer tryouts, Tyler completely lost it during practice. Actually gotten past him with the ball and was about to score when he came up behind me and kicked my legs out from under me. Not a slide tackle, just straight up kick the back of my knees. I went down face first and felt something pop in my wrist. Tyler stood over me and said I should have passed instead of showing off. My parents finally took me to urgent care, but only because my wrist was swelling up. The doctor said it was sprained and asked how it happened. My mom said it was a soccer accident. The doctor looked at all my other bruises and old scrapes and asked if I'd had any other soccer accidents recently. My dad laughed and said, boys will be boys. The doctor didn't laugh. He said he wanted to run some tests just to Make sure everything was healing properly. My parents thought he was overreacting, but agreed. While we waited for my X ray results, the doctor came back and said he wanted to examine Tyler, too, just as a precaution, since we practiced together so much. My parents were confused, but Tyler looked nervous for the first time. The doctor said he noticed Tyler seemed to be breathing heavily and sweating. Even though we've been sitting in the waiting room for an hour. My mom said Tyler was naturally athletic and probably just warm. The doctor insisted on blood work for both of us, saying he wanted to check for any underlying conditions that might affect healing or cause excessive aggression during physical activity. Tyler tried to leave, but my dad made him stay. A week later, we got called back to the hospital. The doctor sat us all down and explained that Tyler's blood work showed extremely elevated hormone levels, specifically testosterone, that was way outside normal range. He said it was consistent with steroid use. Tyler's face went white. Full story on channel link below.

He kept talking, describing what he imagined I ate for breakfast and how many cats I probably had. His friend was cackling now. He made one more remark. Look at her sitting there like a blob. Probably hasn't seen her feet in years. Then finally, we pulled up to my destination and this was it. This was my moment to shine. For a second, I almost let it slide. Then I remembered every smug glance he'd thrown my way and decided he'd earned this. I say, can you pull over here, please? In perfect Romanian, not classroom Romanian, but the exact regional dialect from the rural area where I'd lived. Street Romanian, his Romanian. I've never seen blood drain from someone's face that fast. His mouth fell open and there the phone slipped from his hand and clattered onto the center console. His friend's voice kept coming through h the speaker phone me. Hi. What happened? Me? Hi. I opened the door, but before getting out, I turned back and looked him dead in the eyes and said, you're fat and ugly, too, by the way. And I can see my feet just fine. Can you even see your dong when you pee? Still in that perfect regional accent. Then when I started to get out of the car, oops, my hand slipped, 20 ounces of iced coffee splashed across His back seat, ice cubes scattered everywhere, caramel syrup sinking deep into the fabric. The smell of sugar filled the car, sweet and heavy, like karma wearing perfume. He just sat there frozen with coffee dripping onto the floor mats. His face had gone from white to red to a shade I'd never seen before, somewhere between purple and green. I closed the door gently like nothing had happened and walked toward the building behind me. His car stayed parked at the curb, engine running, him still gripping the wheel like his brain couldn't process what had just happened. By the time I reached the front doors, I swear I could still feel his eyes on me through the glass. Before walking in, I opened the app one last time and adjusted his tip to match his personality. Zero that night. I smiled, thinking about mehi scrubbing caramel from his seats, second guessing every word he says. That thought tastes even sweeter than the coffee I spilled.

When he was younger he'd prefer all the traditionally feminine things like Barbies and makeup. He would also play fashion show with things he took from my closet. And as he grew older he was slow on the pickup of incognito mode. And from the searches he made I figured he was at least bicurious, if that's the proper term for it. Since he hit puberty, I've never had anything against the community. We live in a pretty accepting town, so he didn't have to worry about me thinking otherwise. Well, last year he started bringing a boy around and it was obvious they were dating to the point I figured that he knew I knew, and it wasn't a big deal to anyone. Well, apparently I was wrong. After school yesterday, he and his boyfriend came up to me and said there was something really important they needed to tell me. My son said that they were dating and had been for a year. Well, I was surprised that he wasn't aware I knew and was a bit thrown off. My mouth moved faster than my brain and I said, well that's pretty effing gay. Now I thought it was peak comedy, since it is in fact gay. However, I understand using the word gay in that way gives it a very negative undertone, hence the mouth Faster than brain comment now. My son and I are usually pretty edgy with our humor, this being fairly tame for the stuff we joke about. While probably not appropriate for the situation, it wasn't our norm for a conversation between us. However, he and his boyfriend were very, very upset and left. He currently won't respond to my texts or calls.

He tried to make me do father daughter dances with him at school events. I refused every single time and found ways to get out of it. We talked to our mom about how uncomfortable all of this made us.

She told me I could be blessed with two dads if I gave it a chance. I said if he had his way, I'd only have him. She said that's just because he loves you so much.

I walked into my apartment Wednesday and froze. My coffee mug was in the dishwasher, but I thought I had left it in the sink. When I went to work that night, I ordered pizza and put the leftovers in the fridge. But Thursday night, three slices were gone. I figured maybe I ate them late at night and forgot. But then I found a dark hair on my pillow. My hair is blond. My sheets also felt warm when I got into bed, like someone had been lying there. I called my best friend. I, I think someone has been in my apartment, I told her. She laughed. You have been working too much. You're being paranoid. I figured maybe she was right. But then my couch started smelling like cigarette smoke. My bathroom towel was damp when I came home, even though I had not used it that morning. My TV watch history also showed programs I had never watched and random things kept getting moved around. I felt like something was wrong, but I had no proof. On Friday, my boss let me leave work early. I was excited because I thought maybe if I came home in the middle of the day, I would stop feeling so paranoid. I parked down the street and walked to my building. I unlocked the building entrance quietly and took the stairs to my third Floor apartment. I reached my door and pressed my ear against it. I heard my TV playing and my heart started pounding. I slowly turned my key and the dead bolt. I pushed the door open and my apartment smelled like cigarette smoke and cheap Cologne. The TV was on, but nobody was on the couch. My leftovers from last night were sitting on the coffee table, half eaten with a fork still in the container. A beer bottle sat next to it. I don't drink beer. I pulled out my phone and started recording. I walked toward my bedroom and noticed that the door was half open and my bed was unmade. Someone had been sleeping there. I heard a drawer open, then humming. Someone was going through my dresser. I pushed the door all the way open. My.

The unfinished basement with concrete floors and nothing down there except some storage boxes. I didn't even respond to that. One Thanksgiving morning, my parents called and said, Forget Krista's house, come over here. So we did. My mom pulled out the Turkey she'd bought just in case we had Thanksgiving at their place like usual. My brother showed up around two without Krista. He looked tired. He asked why we didn't come to his house. I said, because your wife uninvited my children to Thanksgiving. He tried to say she didn't mean it like that. I cut him off and said she absolutely meant it exactly like that. She wanted a kid free holiday and that's fine, but we're not doing holidays with her anymore. He left pretty quickly after that. About a week later, there's a Christmas party at my parents house. Just a casual thing, nothing fancy. Krista shows up with my brother. My kids are running around with my cousin's kids, playing with some toys in the living room. Normal stuff. Krista pulls me aside in the kitchen. She says she needs to talk to me. She starts going off about how I turned the family against her. How she was just trying to have one nice event and I ruined it by being selfish. I let her finish. Then I told her to get fucked and that my kids are allowed inside my Parents'house whenever they want. Said if she had a problem with children existing in shared spaces, then she shouldn't come to family events. She turned red and stormed out. My brother followed her. My mom asked what happened and I told her. She just shook her head and said Krista needed to get over herself. My brother tried calling me the next day. Didn't answer. He sent a text saying Krista was hurt and I owed her an apology. I texted back that she owed my kids an apology for trying to exclude them from a family holiday. He didn't respond. Christmas came and went. They didn't show up to my parents house. My dad said my brother told him they'd be doing their own thing from now on. Fine by me.

For three weeks straight, someone had been drinking half my orange juice every single day. I labeled it. I wrote my name in huge letters. Nothing worked, so I bought beats, blended them with water, and poured it into my juice bottle. Looked exactly like fruit punch. Next day, I checked the fridge at lunch. Someone had definitely opened it. I could barely keep a straight face, imagining them taking a big sip, expecting orange juice, and getting liquid dirt instead. A week later, the bottle sat completely untouched. I honestly thought it was over. I felt weirdly proud of myself, like I'd finally stood up to something that had been making me feel small and disrespected every single day. I even started bringing my regular orange juice again, but that feeling didn't last long. Then two months later, I got served court papers right at my desk in front of everyone. The entire office went silent. My coworker Diane was suing me for $15,000, claiming I poisoned her and caused emotional distress. My hands were shaking as I read it. $15,000? I didn't have that kind of money. I could barely afford my rent. I called my dad that night, completely breaking down. He kept asking what I did wrong, I tried explaining that I just wanted people to stop stealing my food, but even he sounded skeptical, like maybe I'd gone too far. That hurt more than anything. I couldn't sleep for weeks. Every night I'd lie there at three in the morning, running through worst case scenarios. Losing my apartment, having to move back home at 32. My credit destroyed. Every possibility. Felt like it was crushing my chest. My roommate told me I should have just let it go, that it wasn't worth this. Maybe she was right. Maybe I should have just kept buying juice and accepted that someone was always going to take advantage. I started wondering if I was actually the bad guy here. The worst part was seeing Diane at work every day after that. She'd walk past my desk with this smug little smile, like she'd already won. She even made comments and meetings about workplace safety and trust. Wanted to quit so badly, but I couldn't afford to lose my job. Right before a lawsuit. My manager called me in and suggested I settle to avoid drama. Settle? Give her money for stealing from me. The way he looked at me like I was the problem employee made me feel sick. I couldn't afford a real lawyer, so I represented myself. I spent every evening after work reading legal advice online, printing out evidence at the library because I didn't want to waste printer ink writing notes until my hand cramped. My mom called me crying one night. She offered to help pay if I lost, but I knew she was barely getting by on Her pension. She didn't have that money either.

Ethan needs a maternal influence during formative years. I and provide structure. You simply can't. I stood up. This conversation is over. Three days later, a certified letter arrived. Inside was a 12 page document titled Ethan's Co Parenting Plan, with my sister listed as co parent A and me as co parent B. My hands shook reading it. She'd outlined custody schedules, holiday rotations, educational decisions requiring her approval, and a clause stating I needed her written consent for any medical procedures. She'd even assigned herself authority over his wardrobe choices and diet.

That night, my grandpa cut them off and took me away. The dinner table was set when mom dropped it casually. We need to talk about your birthday next week, Marcus. Your sister Emma needs some space right now. She broke up with Tyler, so we're postponing your party, not rescheduling. Postponing my 18th birthday, the one I've been planning for months, the one where I was finally supposed to feel like I mattered. I'd invited 15 friends, booked the venue, designed invitations. My parents had promised to help pay since I've been working part time saving for college. Emma sat across from me, mascara smudged, scrolling through her phone. She hadn't even looked up. How long are we postponing? I asked carefully. Dad sighed like I was being difficult. Until Emma feels better, a week, maybe two, maybe longer. She needs the family focused on her right now. You're 18. You can handle disappointment. Emma finally glanced up. It's not like turning 18 is that special. You'll have other birthdays. Tyler broke up with me. This is actual trauma. My throat tightened, but I nodded. The next morning, mom cancelled the venue, lost the deposit, $400 I'd saved from three months of weekend shifts. When I protested, she snapped, your sister is suffering. Stop being selfish. By Wednesday, my friends started asking questions. I lied, said I wasn't feeling well, kept the cancellation vague. Emma posted 47 Instagram stories that week about her heartbreak, complete with sad songs and cryptic quotes. My parents commented on every single one with hearts and encouragement. They didn't.

But karma and my revenge exposed him as a poisoner, kidnapper, and monster. They created my brother Marcus, was born perfect. Athletic, charming, straight A's without trying. I was born two years later and somehow became the family disappointment. Before I could even walk, every achievement of mine was dismissed, while Marcus got standing ovations for breathing. When I made honor roll, dad barely looked up from his paper. When Marcus got a B minus, mom threw a Celebration dinner. The pattern was set early and never changed. By high school, the favoritism had calcified into something uglier. Marcus could miss curfew, come home drunk, wreck Dad's car. Nothing. I'd be 10 minutes late and lose my phone. For a month, mom would literally cook two dinners, Marcus's favorite, and whatever leftovers I got. When I asked why, she said, your brother has potential. We're investing in his future. The unspoken part hung in the air. I had no future worth investing in. College was my escape. Except my parents refused to help with tuition. They'd opened a college fund for both of us when we were young. When I turned 18, Dad sat me down and explained they'd moved my half into Marcus's account because he got into a better school. It the smart financial decision, he said. Marcus will make something of himself. You can take loans. I worked three jobs while Marcus party through state university on my money. After graduation, things got worse. Marcus moved back home rent free while finishing his masters. I living in a cramped studio across town, barely scraping by. Then Thanksgiving happened. The whole extended family was there. And after dinner, Marcus stood up to make an announcement. He'd gotten engaged to his girlfriend, Stephanie. Everyone cheered.

I texted Zoe. Connor just got arrested. But Jimmy is acting like he doesn't know anything. What the hell happened last night? Still no response. Ten minutes later, the intercom crackled my name. Please report to the principal's office immediately. Everyone looked at me. Mr. Reeves looked at me confused. I was confused too. Why was I being summoned? I grabbed my bag and headed toward the door. Mr. Reeves followed me. Why are they calling you? I don't know. Were you at the party? Yeah, but I don't remember anything after like ten PM. I don't know why they want me. Mr. Reeves looked worried. Now we walked to the office together. I pushed open the door to the principal's office.

I'd paid for everything, rent, you, utilities, groceries, her car, insurance, every dinner out. She worked part time making $15 an hour, but her paycheck disappeared on clothes and nails. I spent two months planning the proposal, picked out what I thought was perfect, good cut, good clarity, $8,200 after taxes, two months salary. My family was hosting Christmas Eve dinner. Everyone gathered in the living room. After we ate, got down on one knee, hands shaking. Aurora, I love you. Will you marry me? The room went silent. Phones out, ready to capture the moment. Aurora looked at the ring. Her face twisted into disgust. Are you serious right now? It's small. My friend Ashley got way bigger. You're offering me this like I'm supposed to be grateful? Then she leaned forward and spat in my face. That's what I think of your cheap, pathetic ring. Nobody moved. Mom gasped. I stood there with spit running down my cheek, still holding that box. I wiped my face. We're done. Pack your stuff and get out. You can't just. I literally just did get out. She looked around. For support. Nobody moved. Fine. You want the truth? I'm still in love with Oliver, my ex. Ten times the man you'll ever be. I've been seeing him for months. But this. She gestured at the ring. This is pathetic. You're pathetic. At the door, she turned. Oliver would have gotten me the ring I actually deserve. The day after Christmas, I gave her until noon to get her stuff. At 12:30, I started throwing everything out my second floor window. Clothes, shoes, purses, landing in slush puddles. She showed up with Oliver 30 minutes later. Gym rat tight shirt, chest puffed.

Every question answered with footsteps walking away. I checked her social media, called her friends, even her mother. Everyone said she seems fine to us. That's when I realized this wasn't about communication. It was about control. Three years of marriage and I was expected to decode what offense I'd committed. By day 3, I stopped trying, cooked my own meals, slept in the guest room, lived as if alone. Day 5, I caught her watching me from the kitchen. Our eyes met. She looked away instantly, but not before I saw satisfaction. She was enjoying this power play. That night, scrolling through contacts, I saw a name, Alexandra, we hated in college. She'd reached out weeks ago, passing through town drinks for old times. I declined, too concerned about upsetting the peace. My wife met her once at a reunion and hated her immediately. Stay away from that woman. But now, six days into silent treatment, something shifted. I still in town. I'd love to catch up tomorrow night. The moment I hit send, I felt control again. Thought you'd never ask the craftsman. At 8. Day 7, I woke up liberated, best Cologne. Throughout the day, Alexandra and I texted Reminiscing flirting enough to walk that dangerous line. When I got home, my wife was cooking dinner for herself. I walked past to change. She paused outside the bedroom watching. My phone chimed. Alexandra's selfie from the bar. Red dress, confident smile. Can't wait to see you. I left the phone unlocked where my wife could see it. She stood in the doorway, arms crossed, still not a word. Don't wait up, I said casually. Three drinks in, my phone buzzed repeatedly. Five messages. First communication in a week. Where are you? Who are you with? I need you to pick up milk. Break the silence, not with apology, but with a demand. I didn't respond. Everything okay, Alexandra asked. Better than okay, time we take this somewhere else? Your place? Exactly.

I took it. 20 minutes later, I was stumbling, barely able to stand. Zoe was next to me helping me sit down on a couch. I didn't remember any of this. Then the camera turned, Connor was at it again, spiking another drink. Zoe approached them on the video. What are you doing? Connor looked nervous. Jimmy stepped forward smiling. Relax. We're just having fun. You're drugging people. You drag my boyfriend. I'm calling the police. Jimmy smile disappeared. No, you're not. And if you try, I'll say you're lying. Who do you think they'll believe on the video, I suddenly stood up behind Zoe, barely able to stay upright. My voice was slurred. Don't, don't talk to her like that. I tried to push Jimmy, but I was so uncoordinated I nearly fell over. Jimmy shoved me hard. I went down. That's when Zoe punched him in the face. She had her ring on. The video ended. I was staring at the screen. My hands were shaking. I don't remember any of that. The officer looked at Jimmy. So you drugged multiple students, including this young man. Then you threatened Missy Reeves when she tried to stop you. Then you assaulted him while he was incapacitated. Amy was stammering, I was drunk. I didn't mean to. You were sober enough to threaten her, assault him and come to school today to press charges against her, Mr Reeve Stood up, his voice shaking. You drug student and you tried to get my daughter arrested for stopping you. The police arrested Jimmy right there, handcuffs, same as Connor. The officer told me I should get checked out at the hospital, said some of the d rugs they used can have lasting effects. Three other girls from the party came forward after said they felt drugged, too. Two of them had been hospitalized. Jimmy became the meme of the school, got his ah whooped by a girl a foot shorter than him.

For three weeks straight, someone had been drinking half my orange juice every single day. I labeled it. I wrote my name in huge letters. Nothing worked. So I bought beats, blended them with water and poured it into my juice bottle. Looked exactly like fruit punch. Next day, I checked the fridge at lunch. Someone had definitely opened it. I could barely keep a straight face imagining them taking a big sip, expecting orange juice and getting liquid dirt instead. A week later, the bottle sat completely untouched. I honestly thought it was over. I felt weirdly proud of myself, I'd finally stood up to something that had been making me feel small and disrespected every single day. I even started bringing my regular orange juice again, but that feeling didn't last long. Then two months later, I got served court papers right at my desk in front of everyone. The entire office went silent. My coworker Diane was suing me for $15,000, claiming I poisoned her and caused emotional distress. My hands were shaking as I read it, $15,000. I didn't have that kind of money. I could barely afford my rent. I called my dad that night, completely breaking down. He kept asking what I did wrong. And I tried explaining that I just wanted people to stop stealing my food. But even he sounded skeptical, like maybe I'd gone too far. That hurt more than anything. I couldn't sleep for weeks. Every night I'd lie there at 3 in the morning running through worst case scenarios, losing my apartment, having to move back home at 32, my credit destroyed. Every possibility felt like it was crushing my chest. My roommate told me I should have just let it go, that it wasn't worth this. Maybe she was right. Maybe I should have just kept buying juice and accepted that someone was always going to take advantage. I started wondering if I was actually the bad guy here. The worst part was seeing Diane at work every day after that. She'd walk past my desk with this smug little smile like she'd already won. She even made comments and meetings about workplace safety and trust. Wanted to quit so badly, but I couldn't afford to lose my job. Right before a lawsuit, my manager called me in and suggested I settle to avoid drama. Settle, give her money for stealing from me. The way he looked at me like I was the problem employee made me feel sick. I couldn't afford a real lawyer, so I represented myself. I spent every evening after work reading legal advice online, printing out evidence at the library because I didn't want to waste printer ink writing notes until my hand cramped. My mom called me crying one night. She offered to help pay if I lost, but I knew she was barely getting by on Her pension, she didn't have that money either. The guilt of dragging her into my mess was eating me alive. I felt like I was drowning. The day of court, I threw up twice before leaving my apartment. I.

After she cheated and left, Nathan texted me directly. Said he really needed the car for work and didn't understand why I was doing this. That part actually got to me, because Nathan was a good kid, but I still said no. I told him I was sorry, but the situation had changed, and I couldn't just give away a car I owned. Amy started blowing up my phone. Then her mom called me, then her sister, all saying the same thing about how I'm screwing over kids who didn't do anything wrong. Her mom literally said I was stealing from children. I blocked most of them. Sold the focus two weeks later for $2,800. Took a loss, but I needed it gone. Use the money to pay some bills. Amy found out I sold it and went nuclear. She tried to take me to small claims court saying I owed her the value of the car.

She said it was fine as long as Nathan could drive it. Fast forward to last year. Things with Amy started falling apart. She got weird and distant, started going out more with her friends. Then I found out she'd been seeing some guy from her work for, like, three months. When I confronted her, she didn't even deny it. Just said she wasn't happy anymore. We broke up. She moved out and took the kids. Obviously, the whole thing sucked, but whatever. People break up. Two days after she leaves, Amy texts me asking when I'm gonna bring the car over for Nathan.

Got a transfer through work to Toronto. Figured if she wanted nothing to do with me, I'd make it easier for everyone. Now my brother's telling me she figured it out. That she's cut off her grandparents. She knows they lied. She's been asking about you. He texted. Wants to talk. I put my phone down, made coffee. Stared out the window at the snow. Part of me wanted to get on a plane, see her, hear her say she was sorry. Finally get to be her dad again. But the bigger part of me remembered her face the day she left. The way she looked at me. Like I was nothing. Like I'd killed her mom myself. You don't come back from that. Not really. My brother called. I let it go to voicemail. He called again. Look, he said, when I find

So I stopped inviting her to mine. The message came three days before Thanksgiving. Dad called to explain that Veronica felt I made her uncomfortable at family gatherings. Too many questions about her past, too much attention on dad. She needed space to bond with her biological children without my presence disrupting the family dynamic. You understand, right, he said, his voice small. I was 22. I've been away at college for four years and visited exactly six times. But apparently that was too much. Sure, dad, I understand perfectly. I stopped answering his calls after that. For two years, I focused on building my career and event planning. I worked 70 hour weeks, landed major corporate clients and saved every penny. By 24, I launched my own company specializing in high end weddings and galas. My client list included celebrities, politicians, executives willing to pay six figures for perfection. Dad would text occasionally updates about Veronica's kids getting into college, photos from holidays I wasn't in. Each message felt like evidence of the family I've been edited out of. Then came the email that changed everything. A tech billionaire wanted me to plan his daughter's wedding. The budget was $2.3 million. The guest list included senators and Hollywood a listers. If I pulled this off, it would launch me into the stratosphere of my industry. I spent six months making it flawless. Ice sculptures that never melted. A seven tier Cake that defied physics. Fireworks synchronized to a live or.

Still no response. Ten minutes later, the intercom crackled, my name, please report to the principal's office. Immediately, everyone looked at me. Mr Reeves looked at me confused. I was confused, too. Why was I being summoned? I grab my bag and headed toward the door. Mr Reeves followed me. Why are they calling you? I don't know. Were you at the party? Yeah, but I don't remember anything after like ten PM I don't know why they want me. Mr Reeves looked worried. Now we walk to the office together. I pushed open the door to the principal's office. Jimmy was already sitting there. So was the principal and a police officer with a notepad. I looked around, why am I here? The officer didn't answer, just said, you'll understand in a moment. We're waiting for Miss Reeves. I sat down. My leg wouldn't stop bouncing. Jimmy wouldn't look at me. A few minutes later, the door opened. Zoe walked in. She saw me and her eyes went sad. Immediately, Jimmy stood up. Zoe, look, I'm really sorry about whatever Connor did. I swear I had no idea. Stop lying. Her voice was hot. I'm not lying. Yes, you are. She pulled out her phone, then she looked at me. I'm sorry, you have To find out like this. Find out what? But Zoe didn't answer. Just hit play on a video. The screen showed the party last night, Connor moving through the crowd with a drink in his hand. He stopped next to a girl, waited until she looked away, then poured something into her cup. My stomach dropped. The camera panned. Jimmy was standing right there.

Zoe was next to me, helping me sit down on a couch. I didn't remember any of this. Then the camera turned. Connor was at it again, spiking another drink. Zoe approached them on the video. What are you doing? Connor looked nervous. Jimmy stepped forward, smiling. Relax. Just having fun. You're drugging people. You drugged my boyfriend. I'm calling the police. Jimmy's smile disappeared. No, you're not. And if you try, I'll say you're lying. Who do you think they'll believe? On the video, I suddenly stood up behind Zoe, barely able to stay upright. My voice was slurred. Don't. Don't talk to her like that. I tried to push Jimmy, but I was so uncoordinated, I nearly fell over. Jimmy shoved me hard. I went down. That's when Zoe punched him in the face. She had her ring on. The video ended. I was staring at the screen. My hands were shaking. I don't remember any of that. The officer looked at Jimmy. So you drugged multiple students, including this young man. Then you threatened Missy Reeves when she tried to stop you. Then you assaulted him while he was incapacitated. Jimmy was stammering. I was drunk. I didn't mean to. You were sober enough to threaten her, assault him, and come to school. Today, to press charges against her, Mister Reeves stood up, his voice shaking. You drugged students and you tried to get my daughter arrested for stopping you. The police arrested Jimmy right there. Handcuffs, same as Connor. The officer told me I should get checked out at the hospital. Said some of the drigs they used can have lasting effects. Three other girls from the party came forward after, said they felt drugged too. Two of them had been hospitalized. Jimmy became the meme of the school. Got his ah whooped by a girl a foot shorter than him.

My stepdad looked confused. My mom went pale. Rose stood there proud of herself, waiting for me to crumble in front of everyone. I probably should have cried or screamed, but instead I heard myself laugh. Which one, I asked. Rose's smirk got bigger, thinking she'd won. Your real dad, Omar, not your stepdad. Everyone stared at me waiting for the birthday girl to break. But I took a sip of my drink and smiled back. Let me explain how we got here. My bio dad, Omar, left when I was 3 months old, just packed up and disappeared. The time I was 2, he was married to someone else. By 5, he had two sons with her. I found his Facebook when I was 14, perfect family photos, coaching Little League, the whole suburban dream he apparently couldn't have with us. My stepdad became my real dad when he married mom when I 7. Rose knew all of this. She'd been my best friend since second grade when she slit her cookies with me after some kid called me fatherless. She was there for every Father's Day when I pretended Omar didn't exist, every time I stalked his new family online. Every breakdown when I wondered why I wasn't enough. That's what made this worse. Rose knew Omar was my deepest wound, but why would she do this? Three months ago, rose got drunk and kissed a guy at a house party while her boyfriend was visiting his sick grandma. She called me sobbing the next morning, begging me not to tell. I didn't agree with it and told her she should come clean, but I kept quiet. Two weeks later, he dumped her anyway. Her boyfriend saw her car outside the guy's apartment at 2:00am when he was driving back from work. She was still seeing him after the house party.

I don't know, like a week ago. He's been texting a bunch of us about it. I asked her to show me and she just sighed before handing me her phone. I scrolled for 30 seconds through her Snapchat saved chats with him and I could instantly tell this was definitely not a joke. I even saw a saved photo where I took a picture of her bedroom window from the outside. She actually laughed. Mom, you don't understand. Everyone talks like this now. I think he must just have a crush on me or something and that's why he wants to come into my room. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Was social media teaching her this was normal or something? I showed my husband who happens to be a police officer, and as soon as he saw those texts, he took one of those deep dad breaths. He just told her to block him and said he'd deal with it tomorrow. But we didn't. Even get until tomorrow because that night around 3:00am while we were sleeping, our alarm system starts going off. We both instantly shot up out of bed completely confused as it rang. Why did our alarm go off? But then we heard the scream from our daughter's bedroom. Dad, Dad. My husband instantly jumped out of bed and ran towards her room yelling, honey, what? What happened? But just as he burst through her bedroom door, he saw someone wearing all black jump back out of her window and start running away from our house.

He didn't know I'm a licensed architect. I'm 38, work as an architect from my house in a quiet suburb outside Portland. My backyard is my pride, a certified wildlife habitat through the National Wildlife Federation. Native plants, alligator friendly species. The whole thing took me years to establish properly. Last spring, Kenneth and Patricia moved in next door, both 67, retired. Kenneth took one look at my garden over the fence and his face twisted like he'd smelled something rotten. That looks messy, he said during our first conversation. Brings bees into my yard. You should replace it with normal grass. I explained politely that it was a certified habitat. He waved his hand dismissively. Certifications don't matter in my neighborhood. Two weeks later, I found six of my native plants dead along the property line, down and wilted, clearly sprayed with something chemical. Kenneth said his landscaper must have accidentally gotten herbicide on them. Sorry about that. Another two weeks passed, Patricia filed an HOA complaint claiming my garden violated aesthetic standards. H O, a president came out, walked through my garden, absolutely loved it. Complaint dismissed. Then Kenneth built a fence, beautiful cedar construction, professional installation, also 18 inches onto my property. I knocked on his door, Kenneth, your fence is over the property line. He crossed his arms and smirk, prove it. I went home without another word. Two weeks after that, I Came home from a client meeting to find Kenneth's landscaping crew had mowed down an entire section of my garden, not close to the line, four feet clearly into my property. Rare natives I'd cultivated for three years, plants you can't just buy at any nursery. Kenneth came over that evening holding his checkbook. My crew made a mistake with the property line. I'll pay you $200 for the plants, $200 for three years of careful work. That's when I stopped being polite. What Kenneth didn't know, I'm not just a gardener, I'm a licensed architect. I have the original property survey from when I bought this house. I have plot maps and site plans. I measured everything precisely when I installed the garden beds. I'd also been documenting every interaction with photos, time stamps and detailed notes. I also did some research on Kenneth's recent projects. That fence didn't just encroach on my land, it violated county setback requirements, suppose to be 5 feet from the property line. He built it at 2 feet on his own side. That deck extension he constructed last month. No permit filed required for any structure over 200 square feet. His was easily 2:40. I hired a licensed surveyor, cost me 850, worth absolutely every penny. The surveyor came out and did a professional boundary survey with metal stakes marking the exact property line. Kenneth's fence was 18 inches over his, whose mowing mistake was 4 feet over into my property. I sent Kenneth, a certified letter, remove fence and restore property line within 30 days or I'm filing legal action. He responded by filing a counter complaint with the HOA, claiming I was harassing elderly neighbors. Huge mistake. I attended the next HOA meeting with everything, professional survey with official stamps, photos of the fence encroachment, with measurements, photos of my destroyed plants with professional valuation, $20,400 in rare specimens, documentation of herbicide use near the property line, violation of county environmental Protection ordinances. And I'd already filed a formal complaint with county inspections about his unpermitted deck. The HOA president studied my documents and looked at Kenneth. Is all of this true? Kenneth sputtered, his face turning red. Patricia jumped in quickly. This is exactly what happens when you let people have messy gardens instead of proper lawns. They become litigious and difficult. Wrong thing.

So my friend text me, come over, doors open, followed by an address I swear I've been to 100 times. I show up with my blanket, my hoodie and a family sized bag of chips that could legally qualify as luggage. I walk in, take my shoes off and say, what's up, gremlins? Except the people on the couch are not my gremlins. Four strangers turn and stare at me like I'm a wild raccoon. One girl goes, uh, can we help you? I panic and say the smartest thing my brain can produce, I brought chips. They all look at each other. Then one dude shrugs and goes, he brought snacks, let him cook. Next thing I know, someone hands me a blanket and says, we're watching a movie about a horse with emotional issues. I text my friend like, bro, I think I'm in a different universe. And he responds, dude, my address changed last month. Thanks for the update. But at this point, I'm already invested in the horse movie. These strangers are nice. They laugh at my jokes. They have better snacks than my actual friends. One point the mom walks in, sees me and just goes, oh, hello, sweetie. Make yourself comfortable. Ma'am, you don't even know my name. I wake up the next morning at their breakfast table eating pancakes like a long lost cousin. The mom hugs me goodbye. The dog whines. When I leave. So yeah, I walked into the wrong sleepover. And honestly, I'm keeping both friend groups. I collect families now.

I sighed. Gail was my neighbor and just so happened to be the most popular boy in school. And since I was more of a quiet girl, the type to choose studying for a test over hanging out with friends I didn't have, he always felt safe coming to me for weird favors. He knew I wouldn't judge him. Just last week he texted me a photo of his armpit, asking if the deodorant stain was before his presentation. So now asking me to cut him out of a Halloween costume in between classes didn't even feel that weird. What classroom are you in? I asked. 3B. He responded instantly. I walked to the classroom with a pair of Scissors I had from an art class. As soon as he heard my footsteps, he laughed awkwardly, his handsome green eyes shining through the costume. Thank you so much for coming. This is so embarrassing. I rolled my eyes, fighting back my smile. It's fine. Not like it's anything new. He was wearing a ridiculous inflatable green crayon costume. It was now completely deflated and he couldn't get it off. I tried cutting, but the Scissors barely made a dent. It's like, reinforced with wire or something, I muttered as I got closer. I got a whiff of that Cologne he always wears, and butterflies raced in my Stomach. I tried to suppress my crush on him by reminding myself he had a girlfriend. Chelsea, the most popular girl in school. Blond, pretty. She was everything I wasn't. But suppressing my crush didn't really work, because that's when he joked. You're breathing really fast. Am I? Am I making you nervous? Maybe we can just pull it off, I suggested, ignoring the butterflies that filled my stomach. Worth a shot. His eyes met mine through the mesh window of the costume. You'll have to get pretty close, though. I positioned myself behind him, wrapping my arms around to find a grip point. This okay

We found out I was pregnant in September. My husband Jake and I were so excited. We told both our families the same day. His sister Danny was dating some guy she'd met through a family friend and got engaged in October after knowing him for three months. My in laws were thrilled because Danny had been complaining about wanting to get married for five years straight. At the engagement party, Danny mentioned she wanted the wedding by April 2,025. Jake told his parents right there that my doctor said I couldn't travel after 34 weeks. His mom just nodded and changed the subject. They picked April 19th anyway. The wedding would be in Texas, where Danny's fiance lived. That's a three and a half hour flight from US. I told Jake in February that I'd be 37 weeks pregnant by then and couldn't go. His mom called him and said it was fine if I stayed home, but he had to come. I actually said okay at first because I figured it would be fine. Then we had an OB appointment two weeks ago. I asked the doctor directly if Jake could travel during my 37th week. She looked at both of us and said, absolutely not. She said it would be like rolling dice, and if I went into labor, she couldn't stop it. Jake agreed right there that it was messed up. They picked that date knowing we probably Couldn't make it. Last week, Jake told his mom we both weren't coming. She lost it. His dad called and said if Jake didn't show up, then he wouldn't go either. Like that was supposed to guilt us into changing our minds. Looked at me after the call and asked if maybe he could just go for the ceremony and fly back the same day. I said no. He asked if his parents could stay with me while he went. I said no again. He tried saying his sister would never forgive him. I reminded him that Danny knew my due date when she picked April 19th. She knew I'd be two weeks away from giving birth. His whole family knew. They just didn't care. His mom started texting me directly. She said I was being selfish and controlling. She said Danny only gets one wedding day and we could have more kids. I didn't even respond to that. Jake's dad called him again and said he was choosing me over his own sister. Jake told him he was choosing his child, his actual child that was about to be born. Annie sent me a long message saying I was ruining her special day and that I was keeping her brother from her on purpose. She said if something happened to me during labor, that Jake's parents could just drive me to the hospital. We live 40 minutes from the hospital. She really thought that was a solid plan. The wedding Was yesterday. Jake stayed home with me. His parents went but didn't talk to us. The whole week before. Danny posted pictures all day, and Jake's whole family was in them. His mom posted a photo with just Danny captioned, my only child who showed up. Jake's phone blew up. From his cousins asking why he wasn't there. His aunt called him a bad brother. His uncle said he was whipped. No, but he cared that I could literally go into labor at any moment. Jake turned off his phone after the ceremony ended. We sat on the couch, and he didn't say anything for, like, an hour. Then he just said his sister planned her wedding on purpose to prove a point.

I was 19, holding my future in one hand, my acceptance to John's Hawkins Medical School while signing surgical consents with the other. I never told him about his father, about what happened at my sister Lauren's graduation party. She knows the truth about that night, but we never spoke of it again.

Then yesterday, everything started to shift. I picked my son up from school and he looked upset, full on angry face, jaw tight, staring out the window. Usually he's talking before the door even closes about his bio test, his friends, whatever. Funny thing happened at lunch. We have this whole routine where he steals my coffee and I pretend to be mad. Not yesterday. I tried to cheer him up, asked if he wanted to hit five guys, get milkshake, maybe stop by GameStop. He Loves when we do that spontaneous stuff. Aunt Lauren's picking me up tomorrow, he said, and the next day, maybe all week. Lauren's my older sister. She's 42. Successful, honestly, been incredible. Helping me raise him when I had him so young, bought his crib, paid for some of his early medications. I trusted her completely. That's nice of her. I said, but, you know, I can. I want to go.

He didn't know I'm a licensed architect. I'm 38, work as an architect from my house in a quiet suburb outside Portland. My backyard is my pride, a certified wildlife habitat through the National Wildlife Federation. Native plants, alligator friendly species. The whole thing took me years to establish properly. Last spring, Kenneth and Patricia moved in next door, both 67, retired. Kenneth took one look at my garden over the fence and his face twisted like he'd smelled something rotten. That looks messy, he said during our first conversation. Brings bees into my yard. You should replace it with normal grass. I explained politely that it was a certified habitat. He waved his hand dismissively. Certifications don't matter in my neighborhood. Two weeks later, I found six of my native plants dead along the property line, down and wilted, clearly sprayed with something chemical. Kenneth said his landscaper must have accidentally gotten herbicide on them. Sorry about that. Another two weeks passed, Patricia filed an HOA complaint claiming my garden violated aesthetic standards. H O, a president came out, walked through my garden, absolutely loved it. Complaint dismissed. Then Kenneth built a fence, beautiful cedar construction, professional installation, also 18 inches onto my property. I knocked on his door, Kenneth, your fence is over the property line. He crossed his arms and smirk, prove it. I went home without another word. Two weeks after that, I Came home from a client meeting to find Kenneth's landscaping crew had mowed down an entire section of my garden, not close to the line, four feet clearly into my property. Rare natives I'd cultivated for three years, plants you can't just buy at any nursery. Kenneth came over that evening holding his checkbook. My crew made a mistake with the property line. I'll pay you $200 for the plants, $200 for three years of careful work. That's when I stopped being polite. What Kenneth didn't know, I'm not just a gardener, I'm a licensed architect. I have the original property survey from when I bought this house. I have plot maps and site plans. I measured everything precisely when I installed the garden beds. I'd also been documenting every interaction with photos, time stamps and detailed notes. I also did some research on Kenneth's recent projects. That fence didn't just encroach on my land, it violated county setback requirements, suppose to be 5 feet from the property line. He built it at 2 feet on his own side. That deck extension he constructed last month. No permit filed required for any structure over 200 square feet. His was easily 2:40. I hired a licensed surveyor, cost me 850, worth absolutely every penny. The surveyor came out and did a professional boundary survey with metal stakes marking the exact property line. Kenneth's fence was 18 inches over his, whose mowing mistake was 4 feet over into my property. I sent Kenneth, a certified letter, remove fence and restore property line within 30 days or I'm filing legal action. He responded by filing a counter complaint with the HOA, claiming I was harassing elderly neighbors. Huge mistake. I attended the next HOA meeting with everything, professional survey with official stamps, photos of the fence encroachment, with measurements, photos of my destroyed plants with professional valuation, $20,400 in rare specimens, documentation of herbicide use near the property line, violation of county environmental Protection ordinances. And I'd already filed a formal complaint with county inspection about his unpermitted deck. The HOA president studied my documents and looked at Kenneth. Is all of this true? Kenneth sputtered, his face turning red. Patricia jumped in quickly. This is exactly what happens when you let people have messy gardens instead of proper lawns. They become litigious and difficult.

Call when you can, then progressively desperate. This is urgent, family emergency. Why aren't you answering? Then I saw the voicemail from mom. I almost deleted it, almost, but something made me listen. Her voice was tight with panic. Your grandmother's estate lawyer called.

I've been trying to reach you for two days. Where are you?

I looked down at the IV in my arm, at the machines monitoring my struggling kidneys, at the hospital room where I'd spent four days completely alone. Without thinking twice, I turned off my phone. The nurse came in for evening vitals. Everything okay? I smiled for the First time since I'd collapsed. Yeah, actually, it is. Do you need me to call anyone? No, I said, I'm good. 10 days later, I was released from the hospital. Still weak but stable, I drove straight to Grandma. Helen's lawyer signed every document while my hands were still shaking.

I'll call her right now. Don't, I said calmly. She made her position Clear daughters in law aren't family. I respect her wishes. You're my wife. You're absolutely family. Tell her that, not me.

So last summer, I was getting ready for this pool party at my friend Jess's house. Like 40 people were gonna be there from our high school, and I was super nervous because my ex would be there with his new girlfriend. Jess had given me this bikini a week before as a joke gift for my birthday. It was this tiny, bright neon green string thing that barely covered anything. Top was basically two triangles and the bottoms were like dental floss. She said she found it at some sketchy online store and thought it would be funny. I tried it on, and honestly, it looked amazing on me. Way better than my usual boring black one piece. But it was definitely meant to be a gag gift. This size was somehow perfect, though. Like it fit me better than any swimsuit I'd ever owned. I kept staring at myself in the mirror thinking, maybe I should just wear it for real. The day of the party, I'm standing in my room holding both suits. My safe black one piece that made me look like a mom, or the neon green string situation that made me look like I belonged in a music video. I kept thinking about how my ex Tyler dumped me three months ago, saying I was too conservative and boring in bed. His new girlfriend Madison was this wild party girl who posted thirst traps everyday. So I said screw it and put on the green bikini. I threw a cover up over it and drove to Jesse's house. When I got there, the party was already going strong. Music was blasting, people were jumping in the pool, and I could smell the barbecue from the backyard. I found Jess by the snack table, and she nearly choked on her drink when she saw me. She was like, oh, my god, you actually wore it? And started laughing. I told her I wanted to try something different. She said I looked incredible, but also asked if I was sure about it. Before I could answer, Tyler walked up behind me. I turned around, and his jaw literally dropped. He couldn't even form words for like 10 seconds. Then Madison appeared next to him in this cute but basic polka dot bikini. She looked me up and down with this weird expression, like she couldn't figure out if she should be impressed or annoyed. Tyler kept staring at me, and I could tell Madison was getting pissed. I decided to own it and took off my cover up. Every conversation around the pool basically stopped. Guys were trying not to stare, but totally failing. Even some of the girls were checking me out. I walked over to the pool edge and dove in like it was no big deal. But inside I was freaking out. The rest of the party was insane. Suddenly everyone wanted to talk To me, guys who had never noticed me before were offering to get me drinks and asking for my number. Girls were asking where I got my bikini. Even the popular seniors were including me in their conversations. The best part was watching Tyler. He kept trying to get close to me and start conversations. At one point, he literally said, you look different. And I just shrugged and said, same me, different swimsuit. Madison was getting more and more jealous. She kept trying to do these dramatic poses and splash around to get attention back on her. Near the end of the party, Tyler actually pulled me aside and said he made a mistake breaking up with me. He said seeing me like this made him realize what he lost.

One moment I was presenting quarterly projections. Next, I was staring at ceiling tiles while someone screamed for 9 1 1. Acute kidney failure.

Mimosas, avocado toast, sunshine streaming through windows, everyone smiling like it was the best day of their lives. Caption made my stomach drop. Family day without the drama. Sometimes you need quality time with people who actually appreciate you. I Was tagged. She'd made sure I'd see it, made sure I'd know they'd chosen brunch over their sun hooked to machines. I stared at that photo until my vision blurred, not from tears. I was too tired to cry. Just this cold, hollow understanding settling into my bones. Thursday came, still no calls. The doctors discussed keeping me another week, maybe more. My body wasn't responding to treatment as quickly as they'd hoped. Friday morning, a nurse asked if I wanted her to try calling my family again. No, I said quietly. They're busy. She looked at me.

Senior year, this kid Josh thought he was untouchable because his dad was on the school board. He'd show up twenty minutes late every day. Interrupt class, talk back to teachers, the whole deal. His dad donated a new football scoreboard and renovated the teachers lounge. So administration basically let him do whatever he wanted. Mr. Walters was different, though. He was this older guy, maybe late fifties. Been teaching history for thirty years. He was one of those teachers who actually cared. Stayed after school to help students. Brought in donuts on test days, wrote recommendation letters. But he had zero tolerance for disrespect. For the first month of school, Josh tested him constantly. He'd walk in late with food. Mr. Walters would Mark him absent. Josh would argue his case. Mr. Walters would just keep tea. It was this quiet war nobody talked about, but everyone noticed. Josh's friends thought it was hilarious. They'd laugh every time he strolled in late like it was some kind of performance. And one Tuesday in October, we're learning about the Vietnam War draft. Mr. Walters is explaining how young guys, barely eighteen years old, got called up whether they were ready or not. Had no choice. Shipped overseas within weeks. Actually getting emotional about it because his younger brother died over there in 1968. The whole class is locked in. Actually paying attention for once. You can hear people breathing. That's when Josh strolls in 30 minutes late. Not five minutes, not 10 30. Full minutes into a 50 minute class. He's got a Starbucks venti cup in one hand, phone in the other, AirPods still in his ears. Mr. Walters stops mid sentence. He's holding up this black and white photo of soldiers in a jungle, and he just freezes. The classroom goes completely silent. Even Josh's friends aren't laughing. Josh doesn't even look up. He's checking his Instagram as he walks to his desk in the back row, taking his sweet time. Mr. Walters very slowly puts down the photo. He walks to the center of the room, arms crossed, and just watches Josh sit down, take out his AirPods one by one, and set up his stuff like nothing's wrong. Finally, Josh notices everyone staring. He looks up at Mr. Walters and goes, what? My bad. Traffic was crazy. Nobody breathes. We all know something's about to happen. Mr. Walters nods slowly, like he's thinking. Then he says in this eerily calm voice, Josh, do you know what they called people who showed up late in Vietnam? Josh leans back in his chair, smirking. He thinks this is going to be some boring history lesson he can ignore. His boys in the back are grinning. What? The word just hangs there in the air. Josh's smirk falters for a second, but he tries to recover. Mr. Walters walks toward him slowly. And I swear, the temperature in The room drops ten degrees. See, in war, you don't get to blame traffic. You don't get a Starbucks run. You show up when you're supposed to. Or people die because you weren't there to cover their position mission. Josh shifts uncomfortably in his seat. Okay, but it's just class, man. Relax. Worst thing he could have said. Mr. Walters stops right at Josh's desk, looks down at him. Just class. He looks around at all. Thirty two of us sitting there. These students showed up on time. They're here to learn about people who sacrificed everything. They respect the material, they respect each other. And they respect me. But you, you walk in here

I teach 10th grade English at a public school in Ohio. Three weeks into the fall semester, one of my brightest students, Devon, stopped showing up to class. He'd been getting straight A's, always participate. The kind of kid who actually did the reading. When he came back two weeks later, the school counselor, Miss Inguyen, pulled me aside in the hallway. Devon's father passed away suddenly. Heart attack. He's having a really rough time. Just wanted to give you a heads up. I waited until after class that day and pulled Devon aside. Hey. I heard about your dad. I'm really sorry. Listen, don't worry about any of the work you missed. We. I already took the state exam, so as far as I'm concerned, you're done with the requirements. Just focus on getting through your other classes and taking care of yourself. He nodded, didn't say much. I could see he was barely holding it together. For the next two months, Devin showed up to my class every day. He did every assignment I gave, even though I told him he didn't have to. Solid E+ work. Not his usual A's, but considering everything, I was just glad he was functioning. Then, in early December, I got an email from Miss Nguyen asking me to attend a meeting about Devon. I checked my grade book. He was doing fine in my class, so I had no idea. What this was about. I walked into the counselor's office and saw four other teachers sitting there. Missus Harrington from history, Mr. Lopez from math, Missus Lynn from science, and Coach Davidson, who taught health. Miss Inguyen started the meeting. Devon is failing four out of six class classes he's in danger of repeating the entire year. The only classes he's passing are English and PE. I wanted to bring everyone together to figure out a plan. Missus Harrington jumped in immediately. He's missed over twenty assignments in my class. I told him he could make up ten of them, but he hasn't turned in a single one. At a certain point, we have to hold students accountable. Mr. Lopez nodded. Same situation in math. He won't stay after school for tutoring. Won't ask for help. Just sits there. I looked at Miss Minion. What exactly did you want my input on? He's doing fine in my class. Missus Harrington turned to me, clearly annoyed. That's exactly the problem. You're enabling him. I don't see why we even needed you here. You just let the kids skip out on work. That's not helpful. That's not teaching. The room got quiet. I leaned forward. His dad died eight weeks ago. You really think 20 history worksheets about the French Revolution matter to him right now? Structure matters. Missus Harrington said, these kids need to learn that life doesn't stop just because something bad happens. That's a valuable lesson. He's 16. I Said he just lost his father. The valuable lesson he's learning right now is that half his teachers care more about their grade books than his dead parent. Coach Davidson shifted uncomfortably. Mister Lopez stared at his hands. Missus Harrington's face went red. That's completely unfair. I offered him extensions. The door opened. Devon walked in.

Oh, my god. The video kept playing. Connor walked up to me in the video, handed me a drink. I took it. Twenty minutes later, I was stumbling, barely able to stand. Zoe was next to me, helping me sit down on a couch. I didn't remember any of this. Then the camera turned. Connor was at it again, spiking another drink. Zoe approached them on the video. What are you doing? Connor looked nervous. Jimmy stepped forward, smiling. Relax. Just having fun. You're drugging people. You drugged my boyfriend. I'm calling the police. Jimmy's smile disappeared. No, you're not. And if you try, I'll say you're lying. Who do you think they'll believe? On the video, I suddenly stood up behind Zoe, barely able to stay upright. My voice was slurred. Don't. Don't talk to her like that. I tried to push Jimmy, but I was so uncoordinated, I nearly fell over. Jimmy shoved me hard. I went down. That's when Zoe punched him in the face. She had her ring on. The video ended. I was staring at the screen. My hands were shaking. I don't remember any of that. The officer looked at Jimmy. So you drugged multiple students, including this young man. Then you threatened Missy Reeves when she tried to stop you. Then you assaulted him while he was incapacitated. He was stammering. I was drunk. I didn't mean to. You were sober enough to threaten her? Assault him and come to school today to press charges against her. Mr. Reeves stood up, his voice shaking. You drug students and you tried to get my daughter arrested for stopping you. The police arrested Jimmy right there. Handcuffs, same as Connor. The officer told me I should get checked out at the hospital. Said some of the DRGs they used can have lasting effects. Three other girls from the party came forward after. Said they felt drugged too. Two of them had been hospitalized. Jimmy became the meme of the school. Got his ah whooped by a girl a foot shorter than him.

Security had to escort him from the ICU. Garrett documented the entire incident, noting our emotional instability and inability to make rational medical decision. We went to the hospital ethics committee. Surely this was harassment. But the committee chair reviewed Garrett's documentation and sided with her completely. Grieving families often become combative and facing difficult choices. Garrett is trying to help you avoid prolonged suffering for everyone involved. The next day, Garrett arrived with two hospital lawyers. We're giving you 72 hours to consent to organ donation, she said. After that, we're transferring Josh to county general. They don't have the equipment we have here. Your insurance won't cover the transfer, and you'll be responsible for all future care costs. She slid a business card across the table. Think about keeping your home, missus Patterson. That night, I was reading to Josh, just talking to him like the book said to do. And his hand moved. Not a twitch. A squeeze. Deliberate, strong. David. I called to my husband. Call her. Tell her he squeezed my hand. We both saw it happen again when my husband said Josh's name. Garrett arrived thirty minutes later. She examined Josh, reviewed his charts, and looked at us with something close to annoyance. Even if these responses are real, they'll never walk again, never speak, never recognize you. The kindest thing you can do is end this torture and let his death have meaning. I stared at her. Get out, missus Patterson. Get out before I call security myself. She came back the next morning with a medical director and tried to hand us psychological evaluation forms, complaining we were too grief stricken to make medical decisions. That afternoon I called everyone I could until the hospital CEO answered. He came in person. Tell me everything he said we did. He looked horrified. Garrett was suspended on the spot. The investigation took four months. What they uncovered was worse. Night time visits. Specialist brought in to pressure our semi conscious son into agreeing to organ donation. Visitor logs, footage, all of it. She did it for money. Each successful donor earned her a 15 thousand dollar kickback. Garrett got 11 years. We got a 480 thousand dollar settlement. Josh walks with a cane now. He has a girlfriend. Garrett's still in her cell.

I stared at the screen, unable to believe what I was seeing. The invoice total $34,589. Every floral arrangement, every appetizer, every single expense itemized like a business transaction. Tom found me sitting there, frozen. When I showed him the email, he was furious. It wasn't about the money. We could pay it if we had to, but that wasn't the point. My parents had offered to pay for the wedding. I didn't ask them to cover a single expense. They came to me, offered it as a gift, and seemed excited to be part of the planning. They've been boasting at the wedding, telling everyone how generous they were, portraying themselves as the loving parents who paid for their daughter's big day. The more I thought about it, the angrier I became. This wasn't just about the money. It was years of being treated as less important than Nicole. When she got married, they gave her $400,000 with no strings attached. They didn't ask for a single cent back. Now they were billing me for my wedding like I was a client, not their daughter. After a sleepless night talking with Tom, I made a decision. I wrote them a check for the full amount, but I also included a letter. I didn't want to confront them face to face because I knew I wouldn't be able to contain my emotions. In the letter, I explained everything. I reminded them that I've been independent since I was 16. Paying for my own things while watching them give Nicole everything. I wrote that when they offered to pay for the wedding, I believed they were finally treating me with the same love they always showed her. Instead, they betrayed me. I told them I'd let so many things slide over the years. I never said a word about the different treatment. But I couldn't accept his cruel deception. They made me believe they were giving me a gift, only to turn around and demand and payment like I was a stranger. I also wrote that this would be the last financial interaction we'd ever have. From that moment on, I would reject any offers of health, support or gifts from them. I told them they could give everything to Nicole like they'd always done anyway. I mailed the check and the letter. Then I blocked their numbers. Tom supported my decision completely, and I felt genuine relief. After sending everything, they were silent for three days. Then the messages started. Aunts, uncles, fam, my friends all calling and texting, saying I was ungrateful, dramatic, disrespectful, that my parents had done so much for me and I was overreacting. Nicole called, screaming that I was tearing the family apart, that I should have just paid the Bill without making a scene. Typical Nicole, always taking their side. I haven't responded to any of them.

But they were shocked when I handed them the check in this letter. I never had the best relationship with my parents, but it wasn't terrible either. They just always purred Nicole. At 32, she was the golden child. At 28, I was used to living in her shadow. Growing up, I watched her get the newest iPhone every year while I had a phone until I was 17. She got designer clothes. I got hand downs and worked at target since I was 16 to afford what I wanted. But I didn't complain much. I took pride in being independent. The real shot came three years ago when Nicole got married. My parents gave her and her husband $400,000 as a wedding gift. They bought a beautiful house in a gated community. At the time, I was genuinely happy for her. It stung, but I had my own life. I was doing well as a software engineer, had saved a good amount and was dating Tom. A year later, Tom proposed, been together for five years and he was everything I wanted. We planned a modest wedding, nothing extravagant because we wanted to save our future. Neither of us wanted to blow our savings on one day. We budgeted around 36,000, which seemed reasonable. Then my parents offered to pay for everything. I was touched. For once I Felt like they were acknowledging me as equally important. They seemed enthusiastic, asking about venues and caterers, genuinely interested in helping. I never expected them to give me 400,000 like Nicole, but their offer to however the wedding seemed generous enough. The wedding day was perfect, small, intimate ceremony with close family and friends. My parents gave speeches about how proud they were, danced with us, seemed genuinely happy. For the first time in years, I felt they were treating me as an equal. Tom and I were leaving for our honeymoon the following week, but we had some work commitments first. Two days after the wedding, I received an email from my father. It wasn't a heartfelt note or congratulations. It was an invoice, a detailed PDF listing every single expense they paid for the wedding. The email was brief and cold. Please settle this at your earliest convenience. Your mother and I expect Tom to pay.

We take our breaks together on the loading dock talking about nothing important. He showed me pictures of his daughter constantly. Ballet recitals, science fairs, soccer games. The kid was his whole world. One Tuesday night, Philip came up to me looking stressed. He said his ex wife was threatening to take full custody because he kept missing their daughter's events for work. This recital was different, though. His daughter had the lead role. She'd been practicing for months. I was desperate. Can you cover my shift just this once? I'll owe you forever. I told him I had plans. I didn't have plans. I just wanted to go home and sleep. I've been covering shifts for other people all month and I was exhausted. I felt like I'd earned a break. He nodded, tried to smile and said he understood. I watched him walk back to his station. Two hours later, I was getting ready to clock out when I heard the screaming. A forklift had malfunctioned. Philip was underneath doing inventory in the blind spot. The emergency stop button had been broken for weeks. Maintenance kept saying they'd fix it. The safety inspector had noted it on his last report. The corporate never followed up. Philip was pinned. By the time they got him out, he was gone. I stood there in the warehouse watching them cover his body and all I could think was that he died doing a shit. If he begged me to cover, he died so I could go home and watch TV. His wife showed up the next week with a box of his belongings. I tried to hide in the break room, but she found me. She was holding his work jacket, the one with his name stitched on the chest. He talked about you all the time, she said. Her voice hollow, said you were the only person here who treated him like a friend instead of just another worker. He'd want you to have this. I took the jacket. My hands were.

When I asked dad to walk me down the aisle during a family dinner, he said he couldn't because he'd already promised Ashley years ago that she'd be first. The thing is, Ashley wasn't even engaged yet when he made this promise to her. She didn't even have a boyfriend. I just sat there staring at him while he explained that he told Ashley when she was 16 that she'd be his first daughter down the aisle like it was some sacred vow. My fiance squeezed my hand under the table and I could see my brother James across from us turning red. Growing up, I was invisible. Ashley was daddy's princess from the moment she was born.

I caught Brandon's face. That look, the one that said, don't you dare make this weird. Something snapped inside me. I sat down my glass, looked his mother directly in the eyes, and smiled. From loving your son too much. The silence is deafening. His mother's work clattered onto her plate. His father finally looked up. Even the brother stopped pushing his food around. I'm sorry. What? His mother said, her voice ice. I'm just being dramatic, I said, my voice sugary sweet. You know how emotional women are. Can't control ourselves. Maybe I should tone it down. Brandon's face went from pale to crimson. What are you doing? I turned to him. I'm acting normal, honey. Isn't that what you wanted? His mother's expression shifted. Something flickered in her eyes. Recognition. Maybe even respect. Brandon wasn't having it. He grabbed my arm, harder than necessary. We need to talk now. I pulled away. No. I think I've said everything I need to. You're embarrassing me, he hissed. Good, because you've been trying to erase me for months. His mother stood up. Brandon let her speak. He whipped around. Mom, stay out of this. But she didn't. I asked about her scar. Let her answer. I looked at her, really looked at her, and saw something unexpected. She was hired. Tired of this performance. Cold perfection. It's from a bike accident when I was 12, I said quietly. I was racing my friend down a hill, went Through a fence. My dad said I was brave. His mother nodded slowly. That's a good story. You should tell it. Brandon exploded. This is ridiculous. She's being dramatic, just like I warned you she would be. That's when his brother spoke for the first time all night. Dude, you're the one being dramatic. Brandon turned on him. Shut up, Nathan. But I was already standing, pulling the engagement ring off my finger. I set it gently on the table next to my untouched dessert. I'm done shrinking myself to fit into your life, I said. Find someone who's already small enough. I walk out. His mother followed me to the door. He gets that from his father. She said quietly, I'm sorry you had to learn it this way. Three days later, she called. Said she'd never seen anyone stand up to Brandon like that. Said I deserved better. I already knew I did.

I had this bathroom pass system where students got three passes per semester and if you ran out, you were stuck holding it during class. It worked perfectly at first, but then second semester, this kid, Derek, started asking to use the bathroom every single day. I reminded him he was out of passes completely since mid January and he said he knew, said he'd just hold it. But the next day he asked again and I said no. And he just sat back down with no, no complaints, just went right back to his work like nothing happened. This pattern continued for six straight weeks where every single day Derek would raise his hand and ask for the bathroom. I'd say no and reference the past policy and he just accept it and go back to work without arguing or making any kind of scene. I started thinking he was just testing my boundaries, trying to wear me down until I'd eventually cave and let him go. But he stayed completely polite the entire time. Then one Tuesday, the principal called me into her office with this weird expression on her face, half amused and half genuinely concerned. And she asked if I knew that Derek had been leaving my classroom every single day for the past two months. I actually laughed out loud and told her that was impossible because I never gave him a bathroom pass, not Even once she turned her monitor toward me and pulled up security pretty footage from outside my classroom door, started playing it back from February and the footage showed Derek walking out of my room with the time stamp reading one forty seven PM right in the middle of my fifth period class. She fast forwarded to the next day and same thing, Derek walking out at the same exact time. And she kept going through day after day where every single day showed the same pattern of Derek leaving during fifth period always around the same time. I sat there completely confused cause there was no way I wouldn't have noticed a student just walking out in the middle of my lesson. I would have seen him get up and walk to the door and stopped him before he even reached it. The principal could see my confusion so she rewound the footage and played it in real time to let me watch second by second. The camera showed Derek sitting at his desk in the back corner and he raised his hand high and I watched myself walk over to him and shake.

She should never have been born. I ignored him. That same night, he kidnapped my daughter and tried to bury her alive. The police caught him. That was two weeks ago this morning. The judge went pale when my father in law revealed his true motives. Harold Whitman, 98 years old, stood in that hospital room staring at Emma like she was contaminated. A disgrace to our family name, he said, then shuffled out. My husband David made excuses. He's old, confused his medication. I should have trusted my instincts. Two days later, David collapsed in our living room, drugged. Emma was gone. They found Harold in the woods at 4:00am, standing over a hole with a shovel. Emma was six feet down in a wooden box he'd built, barely breathing. Why, Detective Martinez asked him. Harold looked at her with pale blue eyes. You wouldn't understand. I know what she is. The preliminary hearing was supposed to be routine. Senile old man, attempted murder. Case closed. Then Harold stood up in court and said, I've been tracking her family for 73 years, the Caldwell women. I know what they are. My blood turned to ice. How did he know my Maiden name? Harold pulled out a worn folder. Sarah's great grandmother, Margaret Caldwell, married in 1923. Within five years, her husband was dead. So were two Business partners, seven deaths total. He held up photographs, black and white images of women from different decades, different clothes, different hairstyles, same face, my mother's face. The Caldwell women don't age normally, Harold said. They live longer, stay younger, and they kill always. It's in their blood. I wanted to scream that he was insane, except Missus Patterson next door, died last spring, heart attack at 60. She threatened to report us to the city. My coworker Jenny died in a car accident six months ago. Brakes failed. She'd been flirting with David constantly. David's ex girlfriend, Rachel, died of an allergic reaction after we got engaged. I've been at the same restaurant that day watching her, wishing she would just go away. Ask Sarah how many people died around her, Harold said. People who got in her way. Three women, three deaths, three threats to my perfect life. That baby will grow up to do exactly what her bloodline has done, Harold continued. She'll kill innocent people. I couldn't let that happen again. The judge called a recess. I walked outside, hands shaking, not from fear, from realization Harold was right about everything except one thing. He thought Emma would become a killer someday. But the hunger was already in me, growing stronger. And Harold had.

They were so excited they even drew pictures. But on Christmas Day, when we got to my parents house, there were no gifts for them. Instead, everything they wished for was sitting in front of my brother's kids. I didn't say a word. I just packed our things. The next morning, I woke up to 17 calls and a single text from my grandma. What it said made my stomach drop. I'm Jordan, 34, with two kids, Liam, 7, and Maisie, 5. My dad's former military, firm handshake, twenty dollar in a card kind of guy. So when he called asking what the kids wanted for Christmas, I was shocked. Maybe he's finally trying. Liam and Maisie grabbed the phone, rattling off Lego sets and a pink karaoke machine. Dad laughed, took notes, said I'll see what Santa can do. The next day they drew pictures. Liam sketched a red bike with flame decals. Maisie drew a microphone surrounded by stars. Christmas morning, we drove to my parents house around noon. My brother Brandon's SUV already there. We walked in, the living room floor was a wrapping paper graveyard. Brandon's twins were knee deep in toys, remote control cars, tablets. And front and center, the red bicycle Liam had drawn, same model, same flame decals, same white training wheels. Next to it, the pink karaoke microphone, glittery stand, disco light. Liam froze. Dad, is that Mine. My dad came around the corner, looked at my kids, smiled. Oh, you made it. Merry Christmas. Maisie tugged my sleeve. Is it mine, daddy? Tara knelt beside them. Why don't we go sit in the kitchen? We stayed 22 minutes. Liam kept his coat on the whole time. Maisie barely spoke. No one asked why we were leaving. That night I couldn't sleep. At 6:43 a. M, my phone exploded, 17 missed calls. Mom, Brandon, Dad. Buried under them, a text from my 87 year old grandma. They told the kids the gifts were from your dad, not Santa. My dad used their wish lists. The shop for Brandon's twins then took credit. I didn't respond. I spent the morning numb watching my kids play quietly, pretending not to notice. Then Brandon called. Voicemail, thanks for leaving early yesterday. Gave the boys more time without having to share. Oh, and mom said your kids didn't get much. So we've got extra stuff if they want to come over. No.

Donating sperm pays $150 per visit, but nobody warns you about the actual process. I thought it'd be simple. Show up, do your thing, collect a check. Wrong. First appointment took three hours. They drew seven vials of blood, height, weight, blood pressure. Then came the physical exam where a nurse had to check everything, and I mean everything. She measured things I didn't know could be measured. The whole time she's making notes on a clipboard like she's inspecting a used car. Then she casually drops this bomb. You have exceptional motility and concentration. I had no idea what that meant until she showed me a chart on the wall. Apparently my sperm count is in the top 2% of donors they've seen. She circled a No. 280 million per milliliter. Normal is 15 million. I'm sitting there in a paper gown being told I produce but gets a premium sperm. They made me sign this massive consent form. One section asked what to do with your samples if you die before using them. Options included destroy them, donate to research or transfer to another individual for their personal use. That last one haunted me. Who wants a dead stranger's frozen sperm? Why is that even an option? The donation room was where things got truly bizarre. They walked me down this hallway, handed me a key and pointed to room 3, 5 separate locks on the door, industrial grey couch made of This plasticky vinyl material that stuck to your skin instantly. There was a lamp in the corner. For some reason, just a regular table lamp. No overhead lighting, just this sad little lamp. Full cabinet under the sink. With it, at least 30 bottles of lube, different brands, different types. They restocked after every patient. Next to the cabinet was a red emergency button with a sign press if additional supplies needed. Who runs out of an entire cabinet of lube? What kind of Marathon sessions were happening in here? The entertainment setup was professional grade, 50 inch TV mounted on the wall, surround sound speakers in all four corners like they designed a home theater specifically for this purpose. Remote control looked like it operated a spaceship. 47 buttons, no labels. Took me 15 minutes to figure out how to switch inputs. When I finally got the TV working, I discovered their video library. Hundreds of titles organized by category. Problem, 80% were gay content. Not judging. Just wasn't expecting it. Spent another 10 minutes scrolling to find something that worked for me. The whole time I'm thinking about the people waiting.

Senior year? This kid, Josh, thought he was untouchable because his dad was on the school board. He'd show up 20 minutes late every day, interrupt class, talk back to teachers, the whole deal. His dad donated a new football scoreboard and renovated the teachers lounge. So administration basically let him do whatever he wanted. Mr Walters was different, though. He was this older guy, maybe late 50s, been teaching history for 30 years. He was one of those teachers who actually cared, stayed after school to help students, brought in donuts on test days, wrote recommendation letters. But he had zero tolerance for disrespect. For the first month of school, Josh tested him constantly. He'd walk in late with food. Mr Walters would Mark him absent. Josh would argue his case. Mr Walters would just keep tea. It was this quiet war nobody talked about, but everyone noticed. Josh's friends thought it was hilarious. They'd laugh every time he strolled in late like it was some kind of performance. And one Tuesday in October, we're learning about the Vietnam War draft. Mister Walters is explaining how young guys, barely 18 years old, got called up whether they were ready or not, had no choice, shipped overseas within weeks. Actually getting emotional about it because his younger brother died over there in 1968. The whole class is locked in, actually paying attention. For once, you can hear people breathing. That's when Josh strolls in 30 minutes late, not five minutes, not 10, 30, full minutes into a 50 minute class. He's got a Starbucks venti cup in one hand, phone in the other, Airpod still in his ears. Mr Walters stops mid sentence. He's holding up this black and white photo of soldiers in a jungle and he just freezes. The classroom goes completely silent. Even Josh's friends aren't laughing. Josh doesn't even look up. He's checking his Instagram as he walks to his desk in the back row, taking his sweet time. Mr Walters very slowly puts down the photo. He walks to the center of the room, arms crossed, and just watches Josh sit down, take out his AirPods one by one and set up his stuff like nothing's wrong. Finally, Josh notices everyone staring. He looks up at Mr Walters and goes, what? My bad. Traffic was crazy. Nobody breathes. We all know something's about to happen. Mr Walters nods slowly like he's thinking. Then he says in this eerily calm voice, Josh, do you know what they called people who showed up late in Vietnam? Josh leans back in his chair smirking. He thinks this is going to be some boring history lesson he can ignore. His boys in the back are grinning. What? The word just hangs there in the air. Josh's smirk falters for a second, but he tries to recover. Mr Walters walks toward him slowly. And I swear the temperature in The room drops 10 degrees. See, in war, you don't get to blame traffic. You don't get a Starbucks run. You show up when you're supposed to or people die because you weren't there to cover their position. Josh shifts uncomfortably in his seat. Okay, but it's just class, man. Relax. Worst thing he could have said. Mr Walters stops right at Josh's desk, looks down at him. Just class. He look.

When my wife and I moved into our 64 unit townhome community, we honestly thought we had found a peaceful place to live. The neighborhood looked tidy, the buildings were in good condition, and it felt like the kind of place where people quietly minded their business. What we didn't know was that the homeowners association had been run by the same five original owners for 10 straight years. It settled into their positions so deeply that they acted like the entire neighborhood existed for their approval. Their favorite activity was sending violation letters, and I mean every single quarter, without fail. They would walk around and write up every home for something small. You could repaint your whole place, groom every bush, clean your windows inside and out, and you'd still get a letter. Our very first month there, we received a list of three urgent problems. A tiny scrape on the garage door, paint no bigger than a thumbnail, bit of moss behind a bush that wasn't even visible unless you bent down. And dirt on the bottom track of the sliding door after a rainstorm. According to them, we had 30 days to fix all of this or we'd start paying daily fees. Meanwhile, the real problems in the neighborhood were ignored. The ground had shifted over the years and created areas where rainwater would sit for nearly a week. Some lawns were Soggy all the time and the biggest issue for a decade, the association had been paying a lawyer to fight with the town about getting our road officially recognized. If the road were dedicated, the town would be responsible for snow removal. Instead, we were paying for it out of our dues. While nothing changed. After two years of living there, a few of us decided we had reached our limit. We quietly formed a group and agreed to run for the board at the next annual meeting. But the old board somehow heard about it and tried to block us. Suddenly, we all received pages of new violations. According to the by laws, anyone with unfinished issues wasn't allowed to vote or run for a board seat. It. It was an obvious attempt to shut us down, but instead of discouraging us, it brought the neighborhood together. The weekend before the meeting, we went from house to house, helping each other clear every listed item. Painting, cleaning, trimming, fixing everything. We documented every repair with photos and mailed the completed packets.

Tuesday afternoon my doorbell rang. My brother stood there with two small filthy kids. I need you to take them, he said. I'll be back when she turns 18. He meant his five year old daughter, 13 years. Are you out of your mind? You work from home. You've got space. You're always saying you want kids. Got in his car and drove away before I could stop him. That night I discovered why they looked so broken. Melody, the five year old, couldn't sleep with lights off. She'd panic, hyperventilating, whispering please don't. Her three year old brother Cameron had severe diaper rash from months of neglect. I found crackers hidden in his pillowcase. He'd Learned to hoard food because dad forgot to feed them. I spent $800 at target that first week. Clothes, car seats, actual food, my credit card screamed. My boss asked how long this temporary situation would last, had no answer. Week 3, Cameron spiked a 103 degree fever at the pediatrician. The doctor weighed them both. These children show clear signs of chronic neglect. They're severely underweight, missing critical vaccinations. I'm legally required to call CPS. I'm helping them. You don't have legal custody. Their father could take them tomorrow and you couldn't stop him. The social worker showed up three days later. Your brother still has legal rights. You need emergency custody. That requires a lawyer. Could take a year or more. I couldn't afford a lawyer. I was broke from three weeks of emergency spending. Then my brother's ex girlfriend called. Jenna had lived with him and the kids before leaving. My parents will pay for your lawyer. We loved those kids. He filed for emergency custody. My brother hired his own lawyer within days. At the preliminary hearing, his attorney painted me as jealous, a childless woman who saw an opportunity to steal his children when he asked for temporary help during a mental health crisis. Then my mother took the stand. She cried, talked about my brother's struggles as a single father.

But Sunday morning at 6:00am, I heard a knock on our door. Jake's dad was standing there in his fishing gear holding an extra rod. Ready to catch some fish, he asked with a big smile. I left a note on the kitchen counter, gone fishing with Jake's family. Back by dinner at the lake. Jake's dad showed me how to bait the hook, how to cast without tangling the line and how to be patient. We didn't catch much, just a couple small bass. I felt something I hadn't felt in a long time. I felt important. Jake's dad asked me about school, about what I wanted to do when I grew up, about my favorite movies. He actually listened to my answers. When I told him about the science project I was working on, he got genuinely excited and started giving me ideas. Around noon, we packed up and drove back. The whole ride home, Jake's dad was telling stories about when he was a kid, making us laugh until our sides hurt. When I got home that evening, my dad was in his office still working on those reports, looked up when I walked in. How was fishing, he asked. It was amazing, I said. We caught two bass and Jake's dad taught me how to tie different knots. My dad nodded, that's great, buddy. I'm glad you had fun. There was this weird silence for a moment. Then he. Said you went with them to the lake. I shrugged, yeah, it was only a 30 minute drive. My dad's face changed. He closed his laptop and really looked at me for.

There had been something slightly crunchy in it, but I'd assumed it was nuts or maybe candied fruit. When we got to the ER, Niko's ran ahead to talk to the intake nurse. I couldn't hear what he was saying, but she looked shocked and waved us through immediately. No waiting, no paperwork. That's when I knew something was really, really wrong. As soon as the nurse saw us, the first question she asked me was, do you have reactions to precious metals? Then nurse asked as she prepped an IV, what? No, I don't think so. My voice came out higher than usual. Why would you ask that? She exchanged a look with Niko's, but didn't answer. A doctor appeared with a portable X ray machine, which seemed extreme for food poisoning. They made everyone leave while they X rayed my abdomen. Can you even find my waist? I've been losing weight and training my ABS recently, I joked. But the handsome doctor didn't laugh. His face was serious. There's definitely a metallic object in your stomach, he whispered quietly. Before I could even process what he said, an elderly woman appeared in the doorway. It was Sophia's grandmother. I recognized her from the photos in our apartment. Her eyes were red rimmed, like she'd just finished crying. Is it still intact? She asked the doctor in heavily accented English. The room went silent. Sophia finally looked. At me, and the anger in her eyes made me shrink back. You ate my flurry, she said, each word dripping with barely controlled rage. For what? She sighed like she was sick of my BS and continued, in Greek tradition, we have a lucky coin that we put into sweet bread. When you're the one to eat the slice of bread with the coin, you will gain the luck of a thousand generations. My mind was spinning. A coin? I'd swallowed a coin! Sophia's grandmother stepped forward, showing me the old photograph. But what you swallowed wasn't just any coin. It was an 1823 Greek Phoenix because chimed in, worth over $30,000. I felt the blood drain from my face, and the doctor cleared his throat and handed me a bottle of laxative. You'll need to strain everything to recover the coin. I smiled. Damn, so I'm getting paid to poop. I should eat people's bread more often. No one laughed.

Um, you know, I'm, I'm very pro protecting America and the citizens that live in it. And so I think that we should have more gun control because there's a lot of school shootings that happen as we mentioned. And, you know, I just think it would do a lot to protect the people. Um, and I think the Second Amendment also qualifies that we should have regulations for guns. Um, I wanna know your thoughts on that. Sure. Do you think gun ownership is a right or a privilege? Uh, I think it's a right, but it comes with responsibilities. Okay. Tell me more. Well, I think that there, there should be things in place, uh, you know, things like red flag laws and things like that. the age users to approve Mel Gibson to get his gun rights back, even though he had a domestic violence charge. So, you know, I don't think the people that commit these violent crimes should be able to buy guns and things like that. And I think we should have red flag laws in place to make sure that those violent criminals aren't getting guns. Okay. So let's go. So tell me in your perfect world, what would constitute a red flag? Uh, I mean, just things like, you know, we can look into any kind of medication and things like that. They can affect someone's that could be dangerous. Right. I mean, that could be compromised. I mean, there's a lot of vets that come home from war and that are on a lot of medication. A lot of vets could have their weapons carried away. Well, I'm not necessarily saying bless you, bless you, thank you. It's the pollen or something. Thank you. Haha. Um, I mean, I'm not necessarily saying like it's, it's mainly to prevent, you know, future shootings and things like that. And also, uh, putting in place things like a federal registry so that we know, you know, the types of guns that people have. And, you know, it would just essentially be a federal registry that shows these are the guns that this person has, you know, in case a cop has to go on something like a domestic call that's the most dangerous call they can go on. So yeah, I can see you're coming after this from a good perspective. Let me ask one other question. What do you, what would you say is the ultimate and final purpose of the 2nd Amendment? Uh, I think it's self defense against a tyrannical government, which we agree. Sure, great. Keep going. Well, but I think, I think within the Second Amendment, it also implies that we have high regulations. In the first four words, well regulated militia actually meant well armed, but that's a separate issue. But like, how do you know you're interpreting what the Founding Fathers, well, they Said it in the Federalist Papers, right? So it's not just me, but also in the Heller decision, in the 5, 4 decision that said that gun ownership was a right. This was a hotly debated thing. But see, do you disagree, sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you. Do you, do you like, disagree with the idea of like a federal registry like that? Oh, without a doubt. The only reason you want to register the guns if you want to confiscate them. Well, or to make sure that people like officers of law are protected and know what's going into. I'm in a domestic. Again, that's a, that's a good argument. Right. To your credit, I will try to make a better argument where the problem of the government knowing where every gun is would then lead itself towards mass confiscation. And I would agree with you.

Both her and her son would have died. Did your brother survive or no? Uh, I. I want to continue with this point. So she was offered the opportunity for an abortion because not only was she the main breadwinner of her family, but she is also, um, raising two kids as well already. She's a. She's. The right to an abortion is possibly. Could have saved her life. She did end up surviving, but not. I don't think that, um, we should limit the ability to get an abortion to other women in her situation. Wait, hold on. Time out. So your brother. You know now, huh? Is your brother survive or no? Yes, he did. Wait, so aren't you glad your brother wasn't aborted? I mean, come on. I don't. What kind of argument is that? Aren't you glad that your brother's not dead? It's not that. I. Not. I'm. I'm glad that he wasn't aborted, yes. So that's also pro life. That's what we want. We don't want your brother to be aborted. Imagine how many Millions other like him are aborted. Yes, but if my mom died. She didn't. It's not even a good argument. Well, there's so many people that did. No, that's not correct. I said that earlier. It only happens a couple dozen times a year, and the baby could be delivered by C section. People with Vasa previa have a much higher rate of death than other women. Yes, that happens. And this maybe a couple hundred times a year. And there's 1.5 million abortions every single year. This is on the extreme. If we have to take away abortions, then we're taking away from everybody, even the people who have a medical need for abortion, where the baby is going to kill them if they come out again. I, I can grant you that. Fine, we'll have those exceptions. Can we make abortion illegal for the other circumstances? No, because then. So maybe it's not about those circumstances. No. Oh, it is about those circumstances. Because when we take away those rights from everyone, and we go into a hospital and there's an emergency need to remove a baby, then we have to prove that there's an actual emergency need instead of just it being an automatic right. Then, doctors, you don't have a right to murder another human being. It's not necessarily a right. It's just a ability to be. So when your brother was in your mom's womb, was your brother a human being? I mean, it's. That's. I Don't want to argue that. I think that we can argue about that. It's a very, it's not an argument. It's a long time. When your brother was in, when your brother was in the womb, was it a human being? I, I, I believe that, um, on my moral compass, I believe that he was. But I don't think that my moral compass should dictate the medical needs and so the societal needs of others. Fine. What moral compass should we use to write laws, then? And not necessarily a single one. I think that everyone's moral compass is different. And which one wins? And which one should say, let's, for example, the one that supports women the most, the one that allows women to get though. What standard, though? Why is that? What, why is that good? I mean, by what book do you reference? By some moral standard you're appealing to? What is it? Thank you for your time.

I mean, the color of your skin. Or maybe even set. Color of your skin. Color of your skin. Can you be racist against Asians? Yes. Can you be racist against white people? I believe that you can have prejudice against white people. But in the way that this country was built, and the way that this country has been founded, and the way that there are many laws that have taken place, specifically, like, were you talking earlier with the whole reparations debate? There are many legacies of white people in this country that. Guys, just. Okay, let's just all take a breath. Gigi talking, which I, I, I also would like. I feel like that kind of comes into. Yes, we're not all from this country. We're not all from this country. This is a country of immigrants. This is a country of people. So let me give you an example. Yes. If a group of black individuals, which happens unfortunately so often, say, we wanna go beat up whitey, and they go beat up a white person, was that a racist thing that they did? I would have to ask for further context, but yes. Yes, based off of that. Cool. Yes. So. But then let's go back to your definition, because your definition was that it had to Be the exercise of power. I'm gonna make your definition better for you. That's the exercise of power against a minority group. Yes, but in that case it wouldn't be cause it would be a group of black individuals versus white individual. Correct. So wouldn't a better definition of racism be a human being or institution prejudicing or stereotyping against anybody else because of their race? I do agree that that is. That is a better definition. There's a better definition in terms of how racism is used in society, in terms of setting people behind, not having equal amounts of opportunities. And in these institutions specifically colleges, jobs, etcetera, etcetera, hospitals. But that is my point. I feel like in this country we don't talk about enough. And I think that under this presidency don't talk about not enough. We don't talk about the history and the impact of long term racism in this country against minorities. And I just press pause. Yes, that's all we've talked about the last five years. I mean, but hear me out. 1619 project. We have entire black dedicated channels on Pluto and Hulu and Netflix. We have. We have. We have reoriented the entire national dialogue towards. We had the president of the United States, Joe Biden, take a knee for Black Lives Matter, to have racial reconciliation seminars, to have non stop race obsession. So I think we talked about it thoroughly and properly. So do you think that black people in This country have equal opportunity and are treated equally as. Absolutely. So let me. Let me prove it to you. Okay, so. So Gigi and Charlie. What can Charlie do that Gigi can't do? Okay, I'm. I don't know anything. I don't really know much about you. I don't know, like, what you're capable of. No, no, no. Just on the law. What. What am I allowed to do on the law that you are not allowed to do on the law? On paper, nothing. That's equal opportunity, equal treatment.

You can fly to China and literally just come here as a visitor, show up at a hospital, and, you know, they will give you a US passport and your Kid becomes US citizen. You understand? We are one of the only countries in the industrialized world that has birth right citizenship. And I am proud to be that. We are a country of immigrants. we're not. No, no, no. We're a country of settlers, not of immigrants. Okay? That's a big distinction. Let me tell you the difference. Settlers are people that build a new country that was barren. Immigrants come to a country already built. The people who built this country, they went west to an unconquered, barren country and built a new society. Immigrants helped enrich it. They helped grow it upon that. But the foundation of America, we're settlers, not immigrants. That is a. That is a talking point that we have used. No unifying religion, no unifying race, no unifying. No national origin. We. But what we do share is that if you were born on the soil, you have an inherent birthright to the benefits of American citizenship. And when you read. And that's a huge mistake. And that's a huge mistake. So you disagree with 200 years of president? Yes. Have you read what was discussed during the founding of the fathers? First and foremost, never wanted all of a sudden a pregnant woman to be able to get on. Didn't have airplanes back then. Go across the ocean, and all of a sudden they become a US citizen. Those who draft of the 14th amendment did. Yeah, the 14th amendment, Was in what year, 1866? Yeah, exactly. Way past the founding era. So you don't number two with. No. The 14th amendment was largely applicable to free slaves. I understand that was a purpose, but it was. It has also been extended to those who. Exactly. No, you're right. Has been wrongly extended. You know the 14th amendment by the Supreme Court. Exactly. And they got it wrong, just like the how they got row versus Wade wrong, and we got that repealed.

Now, your counter argument is like, look, dude, it's 5,000 guys. It's not that big of a deal. True. But it sends a signal that we better be serious about cutting in every department, including the Pentagon. By the way, we should cut the defense budget as well because our nation is careening towards bankruptcy. So I just want you to understand from our perspective that nobody should be necessarily off limits from getting us towards a balanced budget. I do understand that. But I think that it also sends a message that we as a country or at least the government doesn't support that sector as a part of stuff that it, the government should like enforce. Fair enough. That's a good point. Thank you. Yeah. Any other questions? You're, I do. Yeah, really. So, um, I just, I'm curious what, uh, who you think Elon Musk has in his best interest. Uh, you really, you wanna live in a country that has a balanced budget and the US dollar reigns supreme. So let's look at the incentive structure. Why would the world's wealthiest man go do this? I want you to tell me what you think. And I'll tell you what I think. I think it's because he is trying to get money for Spacex and he has proposed internally, uh, bills to, to get money for his corporation. So That he can. So let's pause. So, so far his net worth has gone down like $100 billion. So if his goal is to get wealthy, he's not doing great. But he's asking our government for more money for space. Well, he's asking for contracts to go do necessary things for the space fight. Now, I'm, I totally agree that there should probably be an independent review board. He's very close to the president. We got to be close to make sure there's no corruption there. I totally agree, even though I know both Elon and the president. Okay. I, respectfully, I'm gonna disagree. I do wanna ask though, um, what is your opinion on, uh, trying to get rid of the two party system in America? Because personally, I think that it as a system divides us more than anything. I'm, I'm all for it. Democrats should abolish their party first and then we'll go next. Interesting. I, I mean, yes. Look, here's the problem. You're talking about the issue of permanency of factions. George Washington wrote about this extensively. Federalist Papers. Yeah. Yeah. The issue is just eventually in a national system, you're gonna be organized into two political parties. Was it not Madison that said that? Yeah. No, Madison and Washington. Washington warned, warned about two things, permanent political parties and permanent alliances. Those are his two big warnings. Okay. I, I wanna get some other questions though. Okay. Uh, thank you.

A lot of people lost money, too, right? It's investing, but, yeah, that's trading, so. Yeah, but. But should the president be promoting that, a trading game? Well, first of all, he wasn't yet the president when he promoted it. I was about to be, though, right? He was elected. He was president elected. Next question. Next. Next point. Okay, so, uh, how do you feel about. Gosh, um. Here, give me a second. Hold on. That. All you got is the coin. So you ask, how's Trump? So, like an Adrian. Let me, let me. Let me tell you. Let me object. Here's why I think the Trump administration is going so well. Everybody. During the election, we made the border a major issue. And Joe Biden said, there's nothing I can do to close the southern border. Ten thousand people a day were coming across the southern border. Now it's 200 people a day, and none of them are coming into the interior of the United States. We have a border for the first time and for an all time record low, everybody. And also. So did you gather your thoughts? Cool. So, day one, we're ending the, uh, Russia, Ukraine war, right? It's over. Right? Done. Well, I mean, we're in the game, working on it. Day one, right? Day one, it's over. It does take time. Right, but he did say day one, didn't He. He also said early in his administration, and we don't have any issue with him arguing with Zelensky in the White House in a pretty disgusting manner, right? I don't have any issue with him siding with. No, I think he was awesome in the Oval Office. That's. But that's a bit gross, don't you think? Yeah. And don't you think it's so gross to cut Social Security? He's not cutting Social Security. But honestly, like, if there's two, but Elon Musk is advocating for it. But if there is a 200 year old person getting Social Security, I want to meet that person. They're not. They're not. I mean, you just do the math. You just do the math. They are, actually. But it's not them. It's somebody. Database. But they're not getting the benefits. It's. Yeah, it's somebody. You say it's somebody else who's getting it on their behalf. It's a fraudulent Social Security check. That has not been proven, though. I don't think there's any evidence. No, it's proven. It's in the Social Security Administration books. Well, it's in the database. But there's no proof that they're. No, the money is being sent out. So let me ask you a question. It's been proven. Let me ask. Let me. Let me ask you a question. What is one thing you think Trump has done? Well, okay, I. I'm trying to think. I am. I'm putting honest effort in. Um. He did. On Ban, TikTok, those. Okay, we agree. No, I'm kidding. I actually don't like TikTok. Um, let me close with this. I got a next question. Okay. Every person who's intellectually honest should be able to look at a president, whether they like or dislike, and say they've at least done one thing well. I encourage you to be able to do that. Thank you very much. Thank you.

Okay. So I, I'm glad to be an American. I'm glad to live in this country either as far as I know, there's no better country. Um, and, and part of that is that we don't, we don't prosecute people for things they did before it was illegal. Now, my question is, well, first off, I'll state, um, the law is to first off inform people. Secondly, um, persuade them. Um, um, uh, and thirdly to, to, you're gonna talk about pro life laws and potentially criminalizing women that get abortions. Right. Right. And my question, no, I, I, I'm, I'm 10 steps ahead of you. Got it. So let me tell you my position cause we only have so much time. Right? My, my question for you is why are you against abolition? Okay. No, so actually I am for the abolition of abortion. But let me tell you why I personally say if an abortion law was passed, I don't think it would a, be the right thing under the current way that abortion is practiced in America to say that if a woman gets an abortion, she should then go to jail. Let me tell you why it's, cause the way abortion is practiced in this country, women are not given informed consent. They do not know a lot of times what they are doing when they get an abortion. Now that it's a very important distinction in Order to criminalize somebody, you need in the criminal statute, not the civil statute, you need intent. Right. Great. Right. So, and the law would cover that. Yes. So this is a, I think, a largely unhelpful, very far distant hypothetical that does a couple things. Not only do I disagree with it, but individuals like yourself are going around saying that we should put women in prison if they get abortions. There's, there's nothing that says what the punishment. Okay. But however, let me just pause and say, how about first, can we at least agree the people doing the abortions, like the abortionist, they should go to federal prison for the rest of their life. We can agree on that. And so I don't want to spend too much time on this. My perspective is very simple that if you do not have informed consent, then I have a very hard time using the criminal code to go after an individual. Our justice system doesn't work like that. If, if, if there was not intent, then the justice system says you weren't a criminal. Okay. Then, then we agree. Then, then therefore, it shouldn't go after those individuals. If you can't prove intent, then it should not go after those individuals. Thank you so much for your time. I gotta get to the next question. Thank you. We should have laws against it.

Thank god it was just a nightmare. He glances back by chance and sees the woman across from him hasn't slept a wink either. Turns out they share the same mission, guarding this mysterious Canyon. Between them, multiple large jammers are installed on both sides of the Canyon. Making sure they work properly is George's daily job. After the handover with George, the previous guard leaves by plane. The truth is, no guard ever leaves this place alive. George in the watch tower doesn't know this yet. He just keeps working diligently every day. Apart from radio reports, he has no contact with the outside world. Even communication between the two towers is forbidden. One day, George hears a chainsaw from across the way. He can't resist looking through his electronic binoculars. That's when he discovers the guard opposite is a woman. Two months later, Anna's gunshot finally breaks the Canyon silence. It's her birthday today. Using cardboard signs, she asks George about his skills. George writes, pretty good shot. This instantly fires up Anna's competitive spirit. She nails a bottle with one shot, wants to show him what a real marksman looks like. But the next second, George fires off a round two. Just as they're both having fun, Anna suddenly senses danger at her feet. She slowly backs away, her first close encounter with a monster. No time to think. She quickly draws her pistol and fires. She Barely kills one when more monsters start climbing up. Lucky for her, George provides timely backup from the other side. With his dead eye accuracy, he doesn't miss a shot. One bullet, one kill. But when a falling monster triggers a mine, this sudden blast knocks Anna flat. Seeing her hurt, George immediately grabs the gatling gun and unleashes hell on the other side. Anna struggles to her feet and joins the fight, but there are just too many monsters. They keep coming no matter how many they kill. Fortunately, one monster trips the infrared alarm. The auto defense turrets activate on both sides. Instantly, seven or eight streams of fire sweep back and forth across the cliff face, finally wiping out every last monster. Seeing George worried about her, Anna crawls through the scattered shell casings and writes something on a cardboard sign. Next, they need to repair the damaged fences and replace the missing mines. While he's working, George notices Anna providing cover from the east side, can't help but feel touched. But right then, a drone suddenly appears from the Canyon. It hovers right in front of George like it's watching him. Luckily, the drone flies away before the auto turrets activate a false alarm for them both. After this battle, the Canyon returns to silence.

Como experta en desactivación de explosivos, ana se dio cuenta de inmediato de que algo andaba mal. Su esposo intentó abrir la puerta para escapar, pero ana lo detuvo con severidad. Le pidió que mirara alrededor del coche para ver si había algún signo sospechoso. En ese momento notó una luz roja parpadeando en la carrocería. Ana tomó una tarjeta y la pasó con cuidado por el compartimento. Después de asegurarse de que no había cables en el centro, abrió la tapa del compartimiento con precaución, pero no esperaba encontrar dentro una placa de circuito. Corazón de ana se hundió de inmediato. Rápidamente les dijo a sus 2 hijos que no se movieran, de lo contrario podrían perder la vida en cualquier momento. Justo entonces, su esposo le envió un mensaje diciendo que había visto algo sospechoso bajo el coche y efectivamente había una bomba instalada debajo. Ana reconoció que era una mina antitanque capaz de destruir todo el edificio. Si llegara a explotar. Por su estructura, parecía una mina multifuncional. Si el peso del vehículo cambiaba, la bomba podría detonarse en cualquier momento. Eso significaba que estaban atrapados dentro del coche sin poder moverse, ya que al darse cuenta de la gravedad de la situación, llamó a la policía. Mientras tanto, ana también contactó a sus colegas, ya que su empresa se dedicaba precisamente A la desactivación de explosivos explicó la situación lo más rápido posible y su compañero no la decepcionó. Llegó al lugar en solo unos minutos. Al ver el complejo dispositivo dentro del coche, su compañero comprendió de inmediato la seriedad del caso. Sacó su equipo de detección y comenzó a examinar cuidadosamente el área alrededor de la bomba. Pero durante la inspección, descubrió accidentalmente una placa con el nombre de una empresa en el artefacto. Sospechó que podría tener relación con su compañía, así que jack llamó al jefe por teléfono. Sin embargo, para su sorpresa, el sonido del móvil del jefe venía del maletero. Resultó que el jefe también estaba encerrado dentro del coche y parecía no saber absolutamente nada al respecto. Esto dejó a todos confundidos y desconcertados. En ese momento, otro técnico llegó al lugar con equipos de detección más avanzados. Tras escanear el artefacto, por fin lograron determinar la estructura interna de la bomba. Pero entonces surgió una diferencia de opinión. La mujer pensaba que cortar el cable azul detendría la cuenta regresiva, mientras que el hombre insistía en que el cable amarillo era el temporizador, el azul la línea principal y el verde solo un señuelo. Aunque el análisis del hombre parecía más lógico, ana insistió en cortar el cable azul. Él sabía que su compañera había perdido la calma.

A drop of blood suddenly appeared on the floor. When my boyfriend turned around, I bent down to check. It was from my period. Panic hit me in an instant. To keep him from noticing, I rushed to the restroom. I had no pads with me. I could only use tissues for now. Enduring the pain, I followed him to the restaurant. He acted like a gentleman until we passed a dog. Don't control your fucking dog. He exploded with rage. I never thought a small dog could make him lose control. He quickly explained he was bitten as a child. After dinner, I went back to his mansion with him. He smiled with something dark in his eyes. I had no idea a nightmare was waiting for me. An hour later, I ran out in terror. Ignoring the pain in my body, I searched for help. But no matter how I begged, people just looked away as if they had seen this many times before. Then he appeared again, not far behind me. I ran barefoot into the crowded streets. Two kind girls stopped and called the police for me. I thought justice was finally here, but instead I was taken into custody. Compared to outside the cells, strangely felt safer inside. I met another woman. She asked why I was there. I told her everything. Her body shook as she listened. He says he really fucking hates dogs. Why didn't you know this? What I'm about to do ain't personal. Hey, get me the fuck out of here. This bitch is trying to kill me. What are you doing? You are a marked woman now.

This car passes by here every day at exactly 9:24 while your husband is cheating on you at home with a redhead. I suddenly wanted to know if that blind guy was telling the truth or just full of shit. So I snuck back home earlier than usual. I'm home. Where are you, honey? The moment I saw my husband's panicked face, I knew something was off. I started searching everywhere. Where are shoes, honey? What are you talking about here? But found nothing. Honey, what? Just as I was about to apologize, I caught a glimpse of red hair sticking out from the crack in the door. No, no, no, no, no, don't. It was a wig, something he'd apparently bought as a Halloween gift for me. I felt fucking embarrassed, but my husband didn't blame me at all. I thought that was the end of it, baby. I'm only yours. After a brief hug, I let my guard down and went out for a run. But to my shock, that bastard lover of his showed up. And on the road, I ran into the blind man again. I stopped on purpose, furious, and accused him of almost wrecking my family. Go to hell, you and your truth. From now on, you can't escape the truth and you'll always see it in people's eyes. When I looked into those red eyes, I realized this wasn't some stupid prank. Later at Dinner, I tested the waters with a few questions. You don't like the pasta? No, it's fine. That's when I noticed my husband's eyes were changing, too. He had no idea what was happening. Everything's fine. The bus is great. While he tried to explain, his eyes suddenly turned red again. Could all of this really be just coincidence? Same 2 + 2 equals five.

His body was covered in bug bites. Judging by the state of decomposition, the boy had been dead for about two years. However, the way the boy was curled up inside the wall made it look like he was being protected. To get to the bottom of this, my colleagues and I extracted the body. A database match identified the boy as Jack, who had gone missing from his own front porch a year ago. The body was found hidden inside a foreclosed home which had seen several owners come and go, making it impossible for us to pinpoint the killer. Just when I thought we'd hit a dead end, Gara approached me. He discovered that the DNA found on Jack. There was a match for another victim from 12 years ago. That victim's name was Kevin, and he had also been found sealed inside a wall. Both victims were 14 years old, which meant one thing. We were dealing with a serial murder case. I decided to start by investigating the case from 12 years ago. Soon, I arrived at Kevin's house and collected DNA samples from the family. The neighbor was cooperative, too, and voluntarily provided a sample. But the results were shocking. The neighbor's mitochondrial DNA was a perfect match for both victims. Could the neighbor actually be the killer? But here's the problem. Would a killer be stupid enough to hand themselves over like That a comment from my colleague sparked a realization mitochondrial DNA is passed down to sons as well. That meant the neighbor's son could also be a suspect. I immediately returned to the house to investigate further. The neighbor told me that she had divorced her ex husband over a decade ago and her ex husband got custody of their son. She was remarried now and her current husband didn't have any sons. But judging by the looks on their faces, I could instinctively tell they were lying. I made up an excuse to use the restroom and quietly sneaked into a bedroom to look around. That's when a family photo on the desk stopped me dead in my tracks because the mole on the boy's forehead was identical to the one on her current husband.

The mimic octopus is a master of disguise, able to not only change its skin color at will to blend perfectly with its surroundings, but also mimic the shapes of various objects with astonishing precision. Even ordinary sea bed sand becomes its model for imitation as it manipulates the texture of its skin surface instantly creating intricate grainy patterns that resemble real sand, which is truly remarkable. When it encounters seaweed swaying in the ocean currents, it will pause and mimic that as well, synchronizing the movement of its tentacles to perfectly match the rhythm of the seaweed. However, in this perilous underwater world, most of its mimicry serves a survival purpose. A poisonous flounder hiding in the sand catches the mimic octopus's attention. By imitating dangerous creatures can avoid being preyed upon. It gathers all of its tentacles to one side of its body.

Yet I still recognized her instantly, simply by the familiar scent that clung to her. When she got home, she argued with me again without holding back. Right then, the phone in her pocket rang unexpectedly. Thinking she was misbehaving, my anger surged uncontrollably, and I smashed the phone onto the floor without a second thought. Watching it shatter in pieces, she rushed into my room in a panic, tore apart the cassette tapes I treasured most of all, and stormed out of the house without looking back. We waited deep into the night, but she never returned to our home. The next morning, the recorder played a police notice saying that a woman's body had been found lying on the beach. We hurried immediately to the station to identify the remain. I touched the corpse's arm carefully and felt no familiar scars my daughter had from childhood, finally confirming with relief that it wasn't her. We searched the streets non stop from the early morning hours to late into the night, but still couldn't find any trace of her. Meanwhile, she was wandering around casually with her boyfriend, completely unaware of how terrified and worried we had become. When she finally returned home and found us gone. Then noticed the destroyed cassette tapes scattered around. Guilt washed over her instantly. She sat down and began carefully fixing each broken cassette, and when she played one that had been repaired, she realized it held recordings of her entire childhood and all her growing up moments. She once tugged a cable by accident and a pot of boiling soup crashed heavily to the floor. I heard her cries and ran to her immediately without hesitation.

Its mouth was filled with rows of razor sharp teeth, gleaming ominously under the light. The professor instantly realized this fish looked exactly like the one preserved in the fossil. To test his theory, he cautiously extended his finger into the tank. Oh, god, don't do that! The thought raced through his mind. At last he confirmed the truth. This was an ancient man eating piranha, long thought extinct, with an attack power a hundred times greater than modern piranhas, since is so acute that no movement in the water could escape detection. Yet this left the professor deeply baffled. This species should have vanished completely 100,000 years ago. Where on earth could they have come from?

She rushed to the scene with her team, urging everyone to get out of the water immediately. But no one obeyed, and some even made provocative gestures. The police had no choice but to fire warning shots, and luckily this method temporarily grabbed their attention. Everyone stared at the sheriff in confusion.

Because terrorists had planted multiple bomb beneath the bus, if the speed dropped below 50 miles per hour, the bombs would detonate. So the police had no choice but to use this method to send bomb disposal expert Jimmy under the bus. With the bus driver's cooperation, he successfully reached the bombs location. Drawing on his years of bomb disposal experience, Jimmy quickly located the bombs control wire. But just as he was about to cut it, the high speed skateboard suddenly hit a piece of rubber on the road, losing control in an instant and even a safety rope up front couldn't hold it back. At the critical moment, Jimmy grabbed the bus chassis just in time, avoiding being crushed by the spinning wheels. The danger was far from over. If this continued, his strength would soon give out. Even worse, the immense pulling force had snapped the safety rope connecting the skateboard. By now, no matter how strong Jimmy's arms, he could no longer stop the skateboard from sliding backward. Watching death draw closer and closer, Jimmy drove the screwdriver into the fuel tank to use it as a handhold, while with his other hand he grabbed an iron frame on the chassis. This finally freed his whole body from escape. Passengers on the bus quickly opened the floor and pulled Jimmy up, working together to save him.

Watching her happily chatting with the relatives, I felt an unexpected sting of disappointment. But during a temple visit to pray for blessings, my uncle didn't bother keeping an eye on her. Her shoes rubbed painful blisters on both feet. I tried to help her take them off, but she refused. They were a gift from her son, and she adored him more than anything. Then I noticed something that made my blood boil. While everyone prayed, not a single member of my uncle's family spoke a word for grandma. That's when it hit me. They were all pretending. None of them truly cared about her. But grandma said, my grandson is the best. Heart is with me. Her sudden praise pierced right through my guilt.

She shares the news with her sisters, and soon all the hands rush to see her. Unaware that this is all part of a carefully planned sales pitch. The hand in uniform deliberately attracts them over, then pulls out a recruitment ad, claiming that joining the elite chicken corps not only comes with a stylish uniform, also a monthly salary. Faced with such irresistible terms, all the hands start running away from home, one after another, rushing to sign up. When the rooster returns from his walk, he discovers that all his wives are gone. He can hardly believe his eyes. Just moments ago, he was a stud, and now he's suddenly a bachelor. At this point, he finds the note his wives left behind. It all clicks for him. He's furious, unable to accept the situation. Meanwhile, the hands in uniform are already undergoing training, and being a soldier seems pretty appealing. The rooster pushes his chicks to go after them, but not a single hand wants to return home. What the rooster hates most is looking after the chicks. These mothers are so irresponsible, he doesn't want to deal with it anymore. So he simply pushes the eggs away, smashing them onto the ground. Even though the rooster doesn't want to care for them, those eggs are still his children, and he can't completely ignore them at that. Moment! The eggs begin to hatch. Two little legs emerge. Soon all the eggs hatch, and the little chicks are running around naughty and uncooperative. This nearly breaks the rooster. Still, all the chicks eventually break free from their shells, making noise and disobeying. The rooster can't take it anymore and decides he needs some peace and quiet. But no matter where he goes, the chicks follow him everywhere. While the rooster is stressing out, a group of wildcats quietly invades, and their target is the chicks. As their father, the rooster must now stand up to defend them. He uses his strong muscles to easily fend off the wildcats. However, there are just too many of them, and eventually the rooster retreats into the house. The Wildcats are banging on the door outside, and the situation becomes critical. Just then, the elite Hand Squadron arrives. The Wildcats, seeing the terrifying weapons, immediately flee. With no way to fight back. The Wildcats are completely wiped out under the hand squad's fierce attack. Finally, the Special Forces hen team returns triumphantly, and the rooster no longer opposes their enlistment. He says, I'll support you from the rear. However, before he can finish, the Special Forces medic lifts him into the vehicle to practice bandaging technique.

He's accidentally stepped on a landmine that's just waiting for him to sneeze the wrong way. So he's stuck in this awkward kneeling pose, trying to save every bit of energy. He radios headquarters for backup, only to be told a dust storm's rolling in and rescue is 52 hours away. Stuck in a scorching desert with no supplies for two days, that's basically a death sentence. But Jimmy's not giving up. He sets the countdown timer, uses his last drops of water and crumbs of food to fuel up for the coming storm. What he doesn't know is that this isn't just any sandstorm. It's the Godzilla of dust cloud, watching it roll toward him.

When you stepped into the church, it felt as though you were inside the painting, as if you were sharing a meal with Jesus himself. Yet Leonardo never imagined that this brilliant idea would give birth to the world's most iconic artwork, The Last Supper. At first, Leonardo sketched the design on paper, then pierced small holes along the lines on the sheet and fixed the paper onto the wall. With a pencil, he carefully traced the holes one by one. Soon the outline of the painting was clearly imprinted on the white wall. And with one fluid stroke, the great masterpiece began to take shape. Next came the coloring process. Leonardo was incredibly meticulous about the hues. The pigments had to be perfectly blended with egg whites. While he focused on mixing the colors, he glanced over at his assistant painting Jesus's Arm and immediately ordered him to stop sisting that the robes be painted first. It turned out that the mixed pigments would continually change color, and any mistake in the process would cause the color differences to spiral out of control. But just as the painting was nearing completion, Leonardo noticed that the figures were too close to the ceiling, and if they were to stand, their heads would hit The top. Unable to tolerate any imperfection, Leonardo personally removed the paint from the ceiling section and repeatedly measured with a string to make sure there was enough space above their heads should they stand. Once the work was finished, finally, Leonardo invited a priest to view it. And when the priest laid eyes on this monumental masterpiece, he was immediately moved and awestruck by Leonardo's artistry.

Of course, the hitman wasn't about to let that slide. He drew another handgun, which scared Uncle Long so much that he froze, diving to the floor to take cover. Before the hitman could respond, Uncle Long shoved the door forward with all his might, gripping the gun tightly in his hand, refusing to let the guy take the first shot. Still, he underestimated his opponent's strength. Even after hitting the ground, the hitman refused to release his grip. Uncle Long rushed in again, fighting tooth and nail for control of the weapon. In this life or death moment, he seized the chance and slammed the hitman, then used all his strength to throw him off. But unexpectedly, the hitman pulled out an enormous blade. A sword so huge it seemed to be 40 meters long. Fortunately, Uncle Long was quick on his feet, dodging just in time to avoid disaster. It was as intense as it gets. I have to say, even in his 70s, Uncle Long still goes all in when facing a young, athletic hitman. Not an ounce of fear in his eyes. This is an explosive, incredibly thrilling action crime film currently trending on streaming platforms. If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend watching the full movie. It'll keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.

When I asked the invigilating teacher, I found out that the exam was divided into two parts, said A and said B, and the last question was only for said A. As soon as this was revealed, tension filled the examination hall, because if anyone was caught cheating, everything would be ruined. At that moment, Emily, the mastermind of the cheating plan, signaled that she had said A. The student sitting behind with said A also understood immediately. Then Emily moved her fingers as if playing the piano, making secret signals. These were the same signals we had practiced beforehand. As soon as the answers came, were passed from one student to another, forming a complete chain of cheating. The students were set to quickly finish their papers. When one of them went to submit his paper, Emily quietly switched it with hers. Now Emily had the Set B paper, but only 10 minutes were left. She now had to solve all the Set B questions, pass the answers to the other Set B students. Emily began solving quickly, while the Set B students waited anxiously. Meanwhile, one student's pencil broke. Just then, the teacher announced that only five minutes were left. Luckily, Emily finished the paper at that very moment and started signalling the answers with her fingers. This was the moment the Set B students had been desperately waiting. For as soon as the bell rang, Emily sent the answers in a rush. The teacher kept reminding them of the time, and we wrote as fast as we could. Then the teacher walked up to Emily and placed his hand on her answer sheet to stop her. But this man had never seen snow in his life

The roads were quiet. Everything seemed perfectly normal. But within moments, everything changed. Suddenly, I saw a sports car being stolen right in front of us. Two thieves, fearless and bold, sped off with the car in full view of us. For a few seconds, we were stunned, and the sirens wailed, and the chase began. Meanwhile, the thieves were trying to start the stolen car on top of a tow truck. I saw one of them look up in the distance. The police BMW patrol car was racing toward them. The thief panicked and slammed the accelerator to the floor. But our BMW was lightning fast. To avoid a crash, the thief made a quick move. He left the trailer right in the middle of the road and sped ahead, abandoning his partner behind. Within seconds, the highway was jammed. My partner and I jumped out of the car and ran toward the trailer. But just then, the stolen car's engine roared to life. This time, a woman was behind the wheel, and the man beside her shouted, go! The car shot forward like a gust of wind. We were back in pursuit. The speed was insane. Both cars seemed to fly. Up ahead, we could see a bridge, but half of it was closed for repairs. Behind us, the police ahead. A dead end, I thought for a moment. Then I heard the sound of A cargo ship passing below. In an instant I made my decision. I threw the car in reverse, brake hard, then launched it forward with full force. The speed was so intense ground itself seemed to shake. Everyone thought the car would smash into the barricade. But at the very last moment he turned the wheel and the car broke through the railing and soared into the air. It landed perfectly on the deck of the cargo ship below. The crowd watching was stunned. Up on the bridge I couldn't help but smirk slightly.

I fell straight down and the dead tree was about to break. I began cutting the parachute cord and just as the tree was falling, I cut the rope and moved to the side. I stuck to the rock wall unable to move. I looked up and saw a mountain goat easily climbing the cliff. Inspired, I pressed my hands against the opposite wall and mimic the goat's climbing posture. Slowly, I started to climb step by step. Soon I reached a small ledge, but the next moment the ledge began to collapse. I had no time to think, so I stepped on the goats back to climb higher up the cliff. Just as I was about to reach the top, a mountain goat was staring right at me. I dared not move and the goat head but me. I almost fell off the cliff, but the goat hit me again. I grabbed its horns and the goat backed off, finally pulling me up.

With one final push, I grabbed it and climbed inside. I quickly woke up the man who had been sleeping, but there was no time to rest. The hot air balloon was rising higher and higher. The vent valve was frozen and wouldn't open, so I had no choice but to climb to the top to release the air. I scrambled up the side of the balloon, and just as I reached the top, I almost lost my balance. I grabbed the rope to steady myself, then I kept climbing until I reached the very top of the balloon. I stood up, kicked open the vent valve, and in that instant I noticed the snowflake suspended in midair. It hit me. The balloon was falling fast. We immediately tossed out all the heavy objects and climbed up to the iron ring. The man pulled out a knife and cut the basket rope. The basket fell away, but we were still descending too quickly. He quickly cut the ropes inside the ring and the cloth was pulled towards the outer net, forming a parachute.

His body was so frail that even the tiniest germ in the air could kill him. So his parents built him a special home. A bubble house. A place where no outside air could penetrate. Everything inside was kept perfectly sterile and germ free. The lights, fans, T V, everything was meticulously sanitized. There were even plastic tunnels in every corner of the house, and Jimmy would move around through them. But he could never, ever touch the outside air. Every night, his mother would read him bedtime stories. But even to hug him, she had to wear gloves. The local kids often laughed at him, calling him names like Bubble Boy. His mother would scold them and send them away. One day, Jimmy noticed a new family moving in next door. He peeked through his window and saw a girl. Jimmy had never seen any girl so closely, except for his mother. From that day on, he would stand by the window every day just to see her. After a few days, the girl noticed him, too.

During their conversation, Jimmy told her about his health condition. Chloe, that was her name, didn't quite understand, but she smiled and left. After she left, Jimmy's Mother cleaned the whole house again. But Chloe started coming over every day. She would talk to Jimmy, give him fun haircuts, and they'd listen to music together.

I begged desperately, but he gave me no second chance. In the end, I was thrown out of the temple.

Jack sealed the lid from the outside, twisting the screws tight. The friends trapped inside pounded on the lid. Desperate Jack, tears streaming, said his final goodbyes. Heavy rain poured relentlessly. The surrounding groundwater bur burst through the soil, rising. It slowly submerged Jack. His son cried until his strength was gone, helplessly watching his father seemingly make the ultimate sacrifice. The water level kept climbing and the barrel floated upward. Suddenly, a massive rock fell, striking the barrel, sending it plummeting down. It hit a smaller boulder and bobbed back up. But the barrel became tangled in a mess of electrical wires inside. Everyone pounded against the walls trying to break free. Their efforts barely worked. They pushed with all their might. After several attempts, the wires finally gave way. The barrel rose again but collided with a steel pipe. They pushed with all their strength, yet water kept flooding in. Then a sound came from above. It was Jack. He hadn't sacrificed himself at all. Instead, he was kicking the barrel from above, guiding them out of danger, working together inside and out, the barrel finally freed itself from the steel pipe. Far away, a man sat inside a bulletproof car watching everything unfold.

She smacked it dead without hesitation, then split the dough to inspect it. Frozen in shock. There were more inside. She dumped the entire bowl. Calling in a pest control expert, she demanded a full sweep of the kitchen. Stepping into the walk in fridge, even the newly purchased ingredients had spoiled. She tossed everything into the backyard. Every vegetable bed had withered. Nothing remained usable. She had no choice but to call her clients and cancel all bookings. Once she earned five figures a month as a chef, no exaggeration, her dishes could fill an entire restaurant. After all the accolades, she informed her boss she was quitting, determined to open her own place. Come on, kid, you're no boss. Yet to keep the opening on schedule, she started from scratch. The food experts arrived anyway. Using whatever ingredients remain, she quickly plated a temporary dish, deconstructed Caesar salad with herb roasted chicken and grilled little gem lettuce. Guests began tasting. She hustled out the second course, caramelized onion soup with the toasted almond puff. Seeing their pleased expressions, her friend finally exhaled. Then she brought out the third dish with a brief introduction. Boom, a worm crawled out of the plate, inching across the table. Guests continued to eat, utterly engrossed until she noticed there were more.

Within seconds, the sticker burned through and the tank erupted in a violent blast, pulling every pair of eyes toward the fireball. Using the chaos as cover, he calmly moved down the aisle and picked out the medicine he needed. Back at the motel, he spread a sheet of plastic across the floor, clenched his jaw against the burning pain and treated the bullet wound himself. He was a merciless hitman, a man whose word was iron. And the only reason he was in this condition was because his target had stumbled upon a suitcase in the desert, a suitcase loaded with $2 million. Moss wanted to claim the cash for himself, never realizing a tracker was hidden inside. Because of that mistake, he and Anton had exchanged gunfire through the night. To shake off his pursuer, Moss crawled his way across the U dot, dot Mexico border, stashing the money beneath the bridge. By then, Anton had already traced him to a nearby motel called Moss. We need to talk, Moss shot back. I've got nothing to say. Oh, I think you do. Anton's voice turned cold. He was using Moss's wife as leverage. Moss, a hardened veteran, refused to bow to him. The following morning, Moss reclaimed the suitcase from the bridge, called his wife and Arranged a meeting point. His plan was simple, hand her the money and tell her to disappear with her mother before things got worse. But neither of them knew a group of Mexicans had already picked up their trail.

When she regained consciousness, the world around her was utter chaos. She struggled to open the bathroom door, but it was jammed. With no other choice, she kicked it open with all her might. What she saw outside left her numb with horror. The once familiar sky was now a vast icy wasteland scattered with wreckage of the plane. It was clear the plane had crashed into a snow capped mountain. Desperately she searched for her family, but when she found them it was too late. Their bodies had frozen into solid ice blocks. She tried to free them, but the cold was unforgiving. Just then a man appeared from the wreckage, the only other survivor. Conditions here were brutal and resources were nearly non existent. After a tense discussion, the two decided they had to leave this place. Collecting what little supplies they could find, they set off, not knowing how far they would have to go. They walked for what felt like an eternity, finally reaching the edge of the mountain. This was the only way out, a sheer cliff that they had to scale. For the woman who had acrophobia, this was a living nightmare. She slipped, nearly falling off the edge, but man managed. To grab her just in time. With no time to waste, they pushed forward inch by agonizing inch, finally reaching the mountainside. But the angle was almost vertical. Every time she looked down, dizzying waves of fear hit her. They had no choice but to navigate the treacherous path, moving from one rocky outcrop to the next. But a few steps in, the woman was stopped dead by a massive rock blocking her path. Frozen in terror, she couldn't bring herself to move forward. The cliff loomed below, its icy depths threatening to swallow her whole. The man reached out his hand, offering the only lifeline.

With a gentle whiff of a newspaper, he instantly knew it had rolled off the press only minutes earlier. Then a passenger with his arm in a cast stepped onto the plane. The moment the guy entered, the man caught another unfamiliar scent. He narrowed his focus, took a careful breath, and realized a bomb was hidden inside that cast. Staying perfectly calm, he told the flight attendant to alert the captain that a bomber was already on board. The captain didn't buy it and demanded to know how he could be so certain. The man quietly replied that he could smell it. The captain assumed he was completely insane. To prove he wasn't bluffing, the man revealed a little secret. He said that the captain and the flight attendant had been entertaining themselves in the cockpit just a few minutes earlier. Both of them went pale, unable to say a single word. Thanks to his uncanny nose, everyone on that plane was saved. After landing, he got a call from his wife saying their son had been caught smoking at school and the principal wanted to see him right away. He rushed over, and the principal explained that his son and a few others had been smoking behind the garage, showing him a pack of cigarettes as proof.

I heard you and burner got into it. It's none of your business. I just don't think that you would go off and punch a fellow officer if you didn't have a damn good reason. It's about my daughter. I talked to Mcnichols. Mcnichols's ex husband used to beat her, but what does that got to do with Bernie and Kentucky? Mcnichols is. And to set a strong example for her daughter, I spoke with Captain Esperanza. What the hell, Jamie? You talk to Nosa. That's my pension. No, you're not. Yeah, I am. What are you talking about? You're gonna be riding with Officer Bruner for the next month. What? Get punched in the face and get rewarded by driving the person who did it? Good luck with the game. Tell your daughter I said the flaunter flow.

Maura's parents, Wade and Aubrey Driscoll, apparently they were high school sweethearts. It's more like Bonnie and Clyde. They have been dead for several hours before their bodies were found.

Maura wasn't just watching us sleep. She was afraid we weren't gonna wake up. She was trying to protect us. You are a very brave girl, but you don't have to be brave all the time.

He'll tower himself out. That's what you said about Justin, but he hadn't quit barking yet. Justin, get that dog to shut up. What is wrong with you? Can't stay out here all night. Alright, fine. You fall asleep.

So if camel milk isn't okay and why should our government allow the importation of camel milk products from other countries? He sold a fresh, natural drink to customers who sought out the beverage. Mr Lambert violated Section 4, 5, 8 b of the Pure Food and Drug Act. The American Jobs Creation Act, HR. 45, 20 encourages domestic production to create jobs. You cannot uphold a minor federal policy prohibiting the sale of camel milk and in the same breath deny the greater federal goal of creating jobs that benefit our country. I'll rule within the hour.

The color changes when it's exposed to light. The rainbow represents a spectrum of colors. Samantha, who came up with the name Rainbow Polish? I did. I was a student at Santa Monica Tech when Mister Trilling spoke to our class about using science to improve an everyday product. What was the name of the auditorium where he spoke? He spoke at Rainbow Hall. I named the product Rainbow because it was inspired by that talk. There were four versions of the polish. What were they called? Creativity, tenacity, inspiration and passion. And why those names? Because those are Mr Trilling's four pillars of success. So why did you take the hard drive from the lab? Because the formula was mine. I gave Miss Simpson my complete business plan and she claimed it as her own. Even if she were. The defendant is accused of wiping a corporate server and stealing a hard drive that did not belong to her. We asked that her testimony be stricken from the record is irrelevant. The jury will disregard if your client was wrong. There were other ways for her to handle her grievances. Nick, we're back in business full speed ahead on two conditions.

The chefs are excited to leave early. However, two customers came to the restaurant to dine at that moment. When they got the news, the chefs screamed angrily, but still made the food. Shortly after, the waiter brought the food to the customers. However, this woman deliberately complained that the mashed potatoes were too dry and the steak was not tender enough. She rudely demanded that the chef make the food how she wanted it, so the waiter had to take the food back to the kitchen. The woman had pissed off someone she shouldn't have. The yellow haired man seasoned the steak with dandruff. The cook spits on the mashed potatoes. Finally, another man rubbed the bread in his pants and puts curly hair on curry sauce. The head chef was pleased with their behavior, but this scene shocked the trainee chef. Finally, the waiter kindly brought the food to the woman and apologized profusely.

My world was completely turned upside down by a single piece of broken glass. The day Alice arrived at my home, I saw it happen. A shard of glass pierced her thigh, and I watched as she simply placed a bandage over it. In the blink of an eye, the wound healed completely, leaving no trace. I should have been terrified. I should have sent her away immediately. But looking at her, I found myself uncontrollably drawn to her beauty. And in the end, I was completely captivated. By the time I came to my senses, it was already too late. It all started when my wife was hospitalized with a heart condition. To help manage the pressure of caring for our two children alone, I followed her suggestion and visited a robotics exhibition. A sales manager highly recommended Alice to me, praising her as a top tier artificial intelligence, especially designed to mimic human emotions. He said she wasn't just perfect for handling household chores, but was exceptionally skilled at interacting with children. His words struck a chord and I bought her on the spot. Little did I know, that decision would change my life forever. On her first day, I was still a bit reserved, unconsciously treating her like a guest. But she noticed immediately and said to me gently, Mister Nick, please don't stand on ceremony. I'm here to serve this household. You just need to tell me the schedule. I'll handle the Rest. Her voice had a certain magic to it, making one relax almost against their will. Then, as she was familiarizing herself with the house, she astutely identified a safety hazard with the staircase railing and proactively told me she would take care of it and I, as her owner.

I'm kind of doing the same thing here. Anyhow, Harper, it's time for you to listen. I feel you need to stop shoving your ideas down our throats. I feel like your sidekick is way more inappropriate than a delightful 80s movie classic.

#SportsNews,"phillies,sportsnews,jhoanduran,baseballupdates,mibtradedeadline","никогда не видел такого невероятного барашка стокилометровая железная дорога для него это всего лишь лёгкая закуска неважно съедобная это или нет он с лёгкостью проглатывает всё подряд полы и стены он съедает в 2 счета до чиста даже юбку красотки он не оставляет в покое глобус он съедает словно яблоко оставив только 1 коробку штору он засасывает в живот 1 глотком даже комбинезон старого волка не остаётся без внимания из-за этого волк подумал что малыш слишком давно не ел поэтому специально приготовил ему бутылку свежего молока кто бы мог подумать что он выльет молоко а саму бутылку съезда чисто после этого столовую посуду он съел словно сэндвич отправив в живот наявшись до суда малыш выпил кофе чтобы прополоскать горло после чего съел и сам стакан заодно вытерев рот он не пощадил даже салфетку волк увидев это мгновенно испугался если так продолжится весь дом будет съеденным под чистую поэтому он надел на него веревку собираюсь привязать снаружи кто бы знал что барашек примет веревку за лапшу и начнет втягивать волк будет остановил его но туфли мгновенно исчезла волк быстро поднял левую ногу и пересчитал пальцы к счастью все 10 пальцев на месте а барашек в это время обнаружил запасное колесо 1 укусом превратил его в пончик вскоре волк привязал обжор барашка к ветреной мельнице но в мгновение ока всю мельницу он обгладал оставив только лопасти тогда волк отвёз его на необитаемый остров и сковал цепями но в следующую секунду барашек обжора съел фон анимации когда волк засунул его в багажник собираясь отвезти в другое место через несколько шагов машина потеряла мощность тщательно проверив обнаружил что барашек съел все внутренние детали до чиста видя эту ситуацию волк связал его крепко на крепко чтобы лошадь увезла барашка обжору но не прошло и 02:30 секунд как лошадь вся в золоте вернула его обратно при этом лошадь усадила барашка обжору на волка чтобы он тоже почувствовал каково быть стриженным наконец волк придумал отличную идею он посыпал приправами железную дорогу и пустил барашка обжора вдоль рельсов вперёд подумав что таким образом барашек не скоро вернётся назад но к вечеру волк только приготовился ко сну как вдруг небо внезапно озарилось вот это да оказалось барашек обжора съел весь дом целиком волк был крайне растерян но вскоре придумал ещё 1 хорошую идею раз уж луна такая яркая почему бы не отправить барашка обжору на луну чтобы уничтожить её волк не стал медлить и быстро привязал барашка обжору к огромной ракете когда поджёг фитиль барашка обжору успешно доставили на луну в следующую секунду луна исчезла с невероятной скоростью это метод лечения старого ветеринара в топор длиной 02:30 метра вон заяц в дерево это не страшно но спящего Вуди отправили на вращающийся аттракцион не дав ему опомниться тут же устроили тайский массаж вот это да такие манипуляции привели в замешательство дятла живущего в дупле дерева чтобы его домик больше не подвергался разрушению Вуди решительно принял ответные меры если не будет неожиданностей то у ветеринара возникла неожиданность сменился кадр ветеринар снова взял молоточек и начал стучать Вуди увидев это без церемоний решил подшутить над ним похоже это дерево серьёзно больно поэтому ветеринар решил послушать сердце биение но это разве скорость биение сердца это явно скорость отправления на тот свет как и следовало ожидать у ветеринара снова случилась неожиданность чтобы выяснить болезнь дерева ветеринар не пожалел денег на подержанный рентгеновский аппарат но не понимающий ситуации не знал что всё время будет проказничать и на этот раз не исключение он использовал всего лишь старую фотографию и мгновенно сразил его наповал в этот момент ветеринар полностью потерял голову от любви безумно влюблённый он во что бы то ни стало хочет выразить свои чувства затем достал свои многолетние цветы и с нетерпением собрался признаваться в любви кто бы знал что в дупле оказался какитливый дятел эта сцена была весьма неожиданной ведь он холостяк уже 30 лет не то что дятел даже на корову согласился бы но в уде не подерпет такой наглости быть униженным птицей позор и стыд поэтому схватил ружье и выстрелил наверняка но промахнулся и подстрелил дикую утку а это птица под особой защитой как ей следовало ожидать дядя полицейский прибыл точно по расписанию зоркие друзья увидят что это проделки в уде но ветеринар паникует безмерно думая что его отправят за решетку в душе дрожит от отчаяния удивитель что время пришло шагает высокомерной походкой собираясь принять меры эта сцена полностью игнорирует законы Ньютона чтобы забраться на подходящую высоту и дать ему по башке вот это да бить кого угодно но не по голове крабить где угодно но не наверху разъяренный ветеринар видя что Вуди так нечестно поступает мгновенно вышел из себя схватил веревку желая связать его покрепче однако результат оказался неутешительным недовольный ветеринар окончательно разозлился за ночь сделал лестницу длиной 800м для него в этот момент лучше разбиться насмерть чем быть униженным птицей взялся за дело решив биться насмерть жаль что это территория Вуди такая мысль несомненно несбыточная мечта ему нужен лишь небольшой хитрый приём чтобы всё обернулось против него самого ветеринар с тех пор играет в шахматы во сне а Вуди как читер мира анимации в этот момент так одинок поэтому он решил сам поспать всю зиму ведь он хочет во сне с ветеринаром ещё разок выяснить отношения даже заядлый курильщик не курит столько как гуси на работе сигарета в секунду утром как прозвенит будильник сразу закуривает во время бритья не останавливается за завтраком запивает кофе даже тостер превратился в зажигалку после работы Гуфи тоже погружен в дым за короткое время штанина набита окурками наконец однажды зажигая очередную сигарету он обнаружил что не может даже задуть спичку интенсивное курение не даёт ему даже вдохнуть он осознал что больше не может курить поэтому выбросил все сигареты и решил бросить курить не прошло много времени как начались симптомы никотиновой ломки жар тревога и дискомфорт довели его до паники едва успокоившись левая и правая руки начали борьбу к счастью сильная воля преодолела эту трудность но не успел обрадоваться как коллега достал пачку сигарет обсудить работу и похвалил его что бросить курить это круто ведь во всём офисе только он не курит другой коллега ставший отцом празднуя рождение ребёнка протянул ему сигару но учитывая что буфи уже бросил курить собрал её обратно смотри как он завидует начал жадно вдыхать чужой дым однако чувство вины заставило его бредить постоянно упрекая себя в слабости но в конце концов он не выдержал надел пальто и побежал в табачную лапку к несчастью этот магазин сегодня закрыт поэтому он ищет сигареты любыми способами например украсть сигару у индейского манекена видя как кто-то засыпает табак в трубку тихонько подставляет руки снизу увидев окурок на земле тут же бежит чтобы поднять его к тому же не повезло даже лифт не даёт ему затянуться наконец нашёл курительную комнату но не заметил что это женское на улице не может отобрать у бродяги найденный огарок сигар упал в канализацию трубка во рту разбита пулей буфи начал сомневаться в жизни похоже с момента клятвы бросить курить весь мир против него в этот момент он увидел как парень бросил окуров сверху с радостью побежал ловить его рукой но когда упал остался только пепел теперь он окончательно не выдержал увидев идущего навстречу джентльмена встал отчаянно умолять дать ему хоть немного помощи Петя Гуфи в состоянии помутнения от симптомов отмена джентельмен дал ему сигару для Гуфи с сильной никотиновой зависимостью даже если сигара взорвется этот момент стоит того чтобы показать блаженство этот вонючий скунс не мог подумать что моется 8 000 раз в день брызгается духами 9 000 раз но вонь от него всё равно заставляет цветы винуть и опадать сегодня день когда он ищет пару так как долго был одинок он решил начать межвидовую любовь делать на обочине глубоко привлекла его сексуальные ресницы очаровательны 1 взглядом скунс потерял голову когда эмоции захлестнули бросил букет цветов готовясь к ухаживанию кто знал что его запах слишком силён не только погубил цветы но и прогнал влюбленную белочку скунс очень расстроился но повернувшись увидел зайчика и влюбился он тихо зашёл сзади готовясь сделать большой сюрприз но когда высунул голову зайчик словно попал под биологическое оружие испугавшись убежал домой 3 прыжка даже дверь закрыл на молнию наглухо после нескольких неудач скунс не удержался от слёз в этот момент появился Купидон только хотел дать совет скунсу но этот кислый запах чуть не убил его наповал к счастью он вовремя надел противогаз но даже так передав скунсу книгу о любви он моментально исчез по подсказке из книги скунс напевая песню о любви забрался на балкон еноти пытаясь устроить романтическую встречу однако романтическая встреча не выдержит этого кислого запаха енот помешанный на чистоте схватил горшок с цветами и треснул по голове когда скунс упал в воду вонючие рыбки переехали в ту же ночь скунс продолжил любовное наступление белочка слушалась наслаждением но вскоре кислый запах вернул её к реальности испугавшись она мгновенно исчезла но бедная сова которая спала без вины пострадала это ощущение просто невыносимо услышав что скунс ищет пару 30 лет одинокая зайчиха сама бросилась в объятия но не успев пофлиртовать со скунсом развернулась и бросила его в мусорку и убежала не оглядываясь когда Бог закрывает 1 дверь обязательно откроет другое окно скунс надел костюм 82 затем придал форму поливая водой элегантно вышел в центр сцены кто бы мог подумать что скунс оказывается певец с огромным музыкальным талантом только прочистив горло мгновенно привлек внимание зверюшек когда скунс запел песню публика окончательно впала в безумие этот зайчик взлетел в небо этот зайчик расвёл а столетняя бабушка ноги на булет спинан и ноет даже может сделать 49 сальто подряд всего за несколько мгновений скунс получил 1 000 фанаток казалось бы на этот раз точно найдет подходящую пару ведь количество впечатляет однако счастье приходит быстро и уходит быстро в итоге ничего не вышло остался только растерянный скунс 1 сезон не вышел попробуем другой в этот момент грациозная лисица как раз проходила мимо скунс сразу взял краску и покрасился украсил белыми полосками и не забыл покрасить хвост лисичка притворяется скромной скунс наступает дальше лисичка бросается в объятия скунс чуть не потерял сознание они взялись за руки подтверждая отношения но в следующую секунду оба упали в воду краска быстро смылась водой скунс в панике кто бы мог подумать что лисичка тоже скунс переодетый любовь пришла так неожиданно

Aunque sus cuerpos seguían acostados en la cama, sus almas estaban atrapadas en una luna virtual tejida por un braindance. Este es también el origen de la escena icónica de cyberpunk. Con un simple gesto, el alma fue arrebatada. El joven david sucumbió ante la seducción de una belleza, pero nunca podría haber imaginado que aquella mujer de pelo blanco que paseaba con él por la luna, al momento siguiente, lo vendería directamente a la mafia local the folk, solo porque david tenía el sun devistan que ellos querían. Sin embargo, este era el último recuerdo que dejó la madre de david ya instalado en su propio cuerpo. No hacía mucho tiempo, cuando david llevó el sun devistan a un médico de implantes, este le advirtió. Ese tipo de implante era como una bestia salvaje imposible de controlar para un simple novato. La instalación era posible, pero con condiciones. Si algún día david moría o quería quitarse el san de vistán, el implante pasaría a ser propiedad del médico. Dicho esto, hizo que david se acostara en la camilla. Apretando los dientes, soportó el intenso dolor que venía de su espalda hasta que la instalación se completó. Default. Después de todo esto, inmediatamente buscó al compañero de clase que solía acosarlo de una patada. Lo tiró de la silla y después le asestó un fuerte puñetazo. En ese momento, el chico de pelo azul no pensó si las cámaras lo grabarían En un instante, activó todos sus implantes, comenzando el ataque. Sus puños, como una tormenta, pasaban frente a david sin tocarlo. Pero para david, todo esto parecía moverse en cámara lenta. La trayectoria de cada golpe era claramente visible. Sin darle tiempo a reaccionar, david simplemente se movió para posicionarse detrás de él y golpeó con fuerza su cara. La velocidad fue impresionante. El golpe no solo mandó volando al de pelo azul, sino que también le rompió el puente nasal. Incluso así, seguía gritando amenazas de que su padre expulsaría a david. A estas alturas de la situación, david ya no se preocupaba por la expulsión. Era joven entonces, sin imaginar que los regalos del destino ya tenían un precio marcado. En el momento más oscuro de la vida de david, una mujer que cambiaría su destino para siempre apareció repentinamente. Su primer encuentro fue en un tren. En ese momento, lucy utilizaba sus habilidades de hacker avanzadas para robar información personal. Al principio, david no le dio importancia, ya que estos incidentes eran comunes en night city, hasta que lucy cambió su objetivo hacia él. The folk fue el primer fracaso de lucy, pero no parecía avergonzada. Arrastró a david a un rincón apartado. David quedó aturdido, sin tiempo para reaccionar. Lucy lo sujetó firmemente. Tras escanearlo, descubrió que un simple chico llevaba un implante militar. Pero no denunció a david, sino que sugirió que trabajaran juntos. David aceptó sin dudarlo. Necesitaba dinero para pagar el alquiler. Su Colaboración fue perfectamente sincronizada. Lucy usaba sus habilidades informáticas para expulsar el chip del objetivo. David utilizaba las capacidades del sun devistan para actuar velozmente. Sin embargo, cuando llegó el momento de repartir el botín, david se desmayó sin previo aviso. Según el médico, fue por uso excesivo del implante. Bastaba con inyectar inhibidores regularmente. Desafortunadamente, david, sin experiencia, no sabía qué eran los inhibidores. Lo que nunca hubieran imaginado es que el médico clandestino, al ver el implante militar instalado en david, desarrolló una codicia por poseerlo. Pero lucy no era fácil de manipular default. Resulta que el médico sin escrúpulos pensaba que david no duraría ni un día. Por eso no le proporcionó suficientes inhibidores para el periodo de adaptación. Pero cuando escuchó que david había usado el implante 8 veces en un solo día, quedó realmente sorprendido. Para una persona normal, usarlo 2 veces al día sería suficiente para colapsar mentalmente. Aunque desconocía qué tenía david de especial. El médico le recomendó no usarlo más de 2 veces al día, porque aunque el cuerpo pudiera soportarlo, la mente posiblemente no. Pero aún así, esto no disuadió a david de seguir usando el san de vistán. Necesitaba urgentemente dinero. Lo ganado con lucy se gastó en medicinas e inhibidores. David afirmó que podía seguir trabajando, pero lucy se negó. No quería cuidar de un psicópata cibernético. Sin embargo, al enterarse que por impago del alquiler se había quedado sin hogar, lucy decidió llevarlo a su casa. Era la Primera vez que david visitaba el hogar de una chica para disimular su incomodidad. Bebía cerveza constantemente sin percatarse que lucy notaba perfectamente su nerviosismo. Ella bromeó pidiéndole que se quitara la ropa tifold. Solo era porque encontraba su ropa demasiado anticuada. David contraatacó, burlándose de los viejos y anticuados pósters de lucy. Sin saber que había tocado un punto sensible, david intentó explicar que la luna real no era tan maravillosa como la publicidad mostraba. Como estudiante en la academia, arasaka conocía muchos secretos internos. Cuando la compañía decidió desarrollar la luna, incontables personas sacrificaron sus vidas. Más que un paraíso terrenal, era realmente un infierno que enterró a innumerables trabajadores. Pero lucy no prestó atención, burlándose de que david, como niño rico de arazaka, sabía demasiadas cosas para su propio bien. David confesó que había perdido a su padre de pequeño. Unirse a los estudios arazaka tras graduarse, era el sueño de su madre. Ella trabajaba día y noche para que david recibiera la mejor educación en cuanto a lo que david quería, nunca se lo había planteado. Entonces lucy decidió mostrarle su propio sueño. Sincronizó su brain dance con david. Quizás la luna era un infierno para david, pero era el lugar donde lucy soñaba escapar. Incluso podían sentir en el brain dance el calor abrasador. Default. Era la primera vez que lucy traía a alguien aquí, la primera vez que compartía sus sueños con otra persona. Ni ella misma sabía por qué, tal vez por compasión Hacia david

What do you mean the lights just went out? I can't see. Jane still thought it was an act. Doctor House shone a flashlight into her eyes. She saw nothing. More eye tests were done. Still, everything seemed normal. When house asked about Alan's history, Jane said coldly her mother had dated too many men, even changing partners several times a week. House suspected Alan might have a virus, but then Alan began breathing rapidly. Doctors immediately inserted a breathing tube and to their shock, blood slowly leaked from the corner of Alan's eye. Why aren't you saying anything? What's wrong? The most likely cause, breast cancer. But Alan said she had a mastectomy 10 years ago. Breast cancer was impossible. The doctors couldn't find a reason. Alan refused further tests, choosing instead to wait quietly for death. In that moment of despair, a shocking revelation was a.

But I didn't expose her in front of the whole class. I just accepted the milk, then handed it to a beggar on the street, whose face was covered in stories. Because in my last life, my fat and ugly best friend suddenly turned into a stunning beauty. While I, the class bell, gained 200 pounds overnight. My face broke out in spots and I became hideous, the laughing stock of the entire class. After that, she became the center of attention and was crowned the new class beauty. I thought I had some strange disease, until one day I got hit by a car, lying on the ground dying. I finally realized the reason I became fat and ugly was all because of the milk my best friend gave me every morning. And later, she even had someone run me over and kill me. But when I opened my eyes again, I had been reborn to two months earlier during music class. She was telling me to hurry up and drink the milk. The classmates around me praised her, saying she was kind and beautiful. For giving milk to an ugly girl like me. I didn't know how to say no. But after hearing all their mockery, I quickly came up with an idea. I told everyone I wouldn't drink the milk today. I was trying to lose weight and Had decided to start controlling my diet. My best friend panicked right away, pretending to be hurt. She said she made that milk especially for me, and not drinking it would mean rejecting her kindness. As soon as she said that, I snatched the milk and loudly asked who in class wanted it. A bunch of classmates immediately gathered around, saying they skipped breakfast and could use the nutrition. Seeing the milk about to be taken, she panicked, grabbed it back, and cried that she made that strawberry milk just for me and I was giving it away. The class turned on me, saying I was ungrateful, telling me to apologize and drink it. But I knew it wasn't time to expose her yet. So I took the milk back and said my stomach didn't feel well today. I drink it tomorrow. But she wouldn't let it go, demanding I drink it now. Just then, the school heartthrob walked into the classroom and announced a school wide beauty contest. The winner would get signed by a top talent agency. My best friend rushed up to sign up and even tried to flirt with him. But she didn't know he had come here for me. He once saw me before I turned ugly and had been deeply attracted to me. This time he came looking for me specifically. But now, seeing me at 300 pounds, he thought he had the wrong person and quickly left. After he was gone, my scheming Best friend still wasn't satisfied with her looks. She reminded me again not to forget the milk. I was on high alert, wondering how to deal with it. Then I saw a beggar downstairs with sores all over his face. I instantly had an idea. I said I was going to buy bread, ran downstairs, and gave the milk to the beggar. He drank it all in one gulp. Suddenly I felt my face itch. I looked in a mirror and saw that all the spots on my face were gone. I immediately realized as long as I didn't drink her milk, my beauty would return. But it still wasn't time to confront her, so I put on a mask and began planning my next move. Meanwhile, the school heartthrob thought my best friend was decent looking, so he invited her to train at his father's company. The whole class was jealous that she might get signed. First she was smug, pretending to care about me, then turned around and mocked me, saying just looking at my face made her sick. But right after she said that, her skin suddenly started burning. Everyone turned to look and their eyes

I was just a regular Jack operator at the NASCAR track. By a stroke of luck, I got a feeling for the driver who went to grab a bite and race in his place. My good friend Carl was thrilled for me. Haha, yeah, that's my boy Ricky. But the engineer told me not to go too fast saying I'd have to pay for it if the car got wrecked. If you wreck that car, that's 200 grand out of your pocket. So let's take it nice and slow. Okay, with all due respect, Lucius, I'm gonna do some driving. Excuse me, coming through. Apparently we've got a situation for the laughing clown. No. 26 car. Terry Shabo is refusing to drive and one of his crew members is taking the wheel. Hey Lucius, just want to share a little piece of personal information with you. I got a chubby right now because it's one of the most awesome experiences of my life because I'm getting to drop a race car. I can't believe it. That's when my talent really shine through. Never having driven a race car before, I managed to pass one car after another in the little time left. Starting from dead last, I somehow pulled off a miracle and took third place. During the post race interview, I was so nervous, I didn't even know where to put my hands. The team owner's son thought I was a fool. But the owner saw I was a natural and decided to groom me. I never forgot my good friend Carl, though. Thanks to my persistent request, the team agreed to add another car to the lineup just for Carl and Ricky Bobby wins with Count Uncle junior finishing second. Yeah, baby psych and fake. After that, Carl and I raced together in NASCAR. Carl would lead the pack up front to take the win resistance while I'd make the winning pass at the crucial moment. Hey, driver, drive me please be 18. Later on, I started getting tons of endorsement deals. I married Carrie and we lived happily ever after. One day, Carrie fixed up a nice spread of fast food for the whole family. We thank you so much for this bountiful harvest. Domino's, KFC and it always delicious Taco Bell. I just want to take time to say thank you for my family, my two beautiful, beautiful handsome striking sons, Walker and Texas Ranger or TR as we call. And of course my red hot smoking wife Carly, who's a stone cold fox.

This morning, parents called police after finding an electric fence just inches away from where their children wait for the bus. The man who put up the fence says he had finally had it with students trespassing and leaving trash in his yard. He figured the fence would keep them out. I'm not in charge of other people's kids. All I can do is protect myself. But jolted neighbors thought the fence was too extreme. They called police, and police called public works, who questioned whether the fence encroached on a county easement. Show me what's the truth. You know, everybody just giving me different words. The relentless homeowner not giving in because he says the signs posted in his front yard did nothing. It says no trespassing. What, you don't like kids? Me? I'm. I'm a parent, and I don't want any children around here to get electrocuted. That's a little too extreme. I mean, you're gonna let the kids get electrocuted? That's not cool.

Then the girl took another bite, and the auntie actually fled from the elevator in fear. The girl looked completely confused, unaware that something even stranger was happening. When she got home, she discovered that her family couldn't see her, nor could they hear her speak. Panicked, she rushed to the bathroom and looked in the mirror, but there was no reflection of her. At that moment, she finally understood why the woman in the elevator had been so frightened, because she hadn't seen the girl at all, only a floating ice cream. Girl quickly dialed her boyfriend's number, wanting to tell him what had happened. But no matter how loudly she shouted, her boyfriend couldn't hear her voice. She was terrified, yet things were only about to get weirder. The next morning, while brushing her teeth, she saw only the toothbrush trembling. Her reflection was still missing from the mirror. When putting on her shoes, she could only see a pair of empty shoes. On the bus, the driver didn't seem to notice her at all. After getting on, she even tapped her transit card out of habit. People could hear the beep, but no one could see who had scanned the card. Although no one could see her, her physical body still existed. To avoid scaring others, she carefully avoided contact. With passengers. But she still accidentally brushed against a man. The man clearly felt something touch him. But when he turned, there was nothing there. Days passed without any trace of the girl. Her boyfriend grew frantic, asking around non stop. One night, as he walked downstairs, he found her phone lying on a bench. Fearing something bad had happened to her, he sat there overcome with worry. Just then, a hand suddenly reached out.

Realizing how serious the situation was, he quickly told his son to get ready so they could go home, and promised he'd buy him another toy next time.

Park is gonna hit only part of it. I mean, don't worry. It's going in the ocean. Dad, come and sit with me. Yeah, I just gotta go talk to your mom for a second. He asked his wife if she had received any kind of alert, but she said she hadn't. She thought it might just be a drill. The man then told her that their family had been chosen to enter the shelter.

Then why is half of our military on the move with a ton of planes in the sky? Hey, John, here it comes. They walked from the kitchen into the living Room where the news reported that the comet fragments would strike Bermuda in just a few seconds.

Then Jessica approached the woman who had been crying, admiring her bargaining technique. Hmm, I like you.

Not even when a bug landed on her back did she sense the danger. Out of nowhere, the man launched an attack. The woman screamed in agony, her cry echoing through the night. Her friends, hearing the scream, rushed back to the villa. One of them needed to use the bathroom, so he broke off from the group and went alone. To his shock, he ran into the woman who had just been attacked. He tried to seduce him, but when he saw the blood seeping steadily from beneath her, terror gripped him, panic. He rushed back to find the other, but they didn't believe him, thinking he'd simply had too much to drink. He LED them to the bathroom, hoping they'd see what he had. But when they got there, it was completely empty. The two men assumed he was imagining things and refused to listen to any more of his frantic explanation. However, just as they reached the door, a demon was waiting for them outside. They quickly rushed back inside, desperately searching for a way to escape. Remembering an old secret passage in the basement, they headed down to open it. But to their horror, two more monsters were waiting for them in the dark corridor.

Just as he nearly deceived the buyer, a small spirit emerged in the bathtub. Without hesitation, the agent shoved the ghost underwater. Seeing his struggle to keep it submerged, the buyer asked, is there something you're not disclosing? The agent casually sat in the tub, cheerfully claiming it so hot I might as well bathe. Through his deceit persuasion, Lisa finally signed the contract. That very night, as Lisa showered, a pale hand materialized above her head. She spun around but found nothing. After her shower, the small ghost appeared in the attic, contorting its body as it crawled downstairs. When Lisa pursued it, the spirit vanished. Curious, she investigated the second floor and covered a hidden compartment in the wardrobe leading to the attic. Lisa lit a lighter to explore. The small ghost lunged again, hoping to frighten her to death. Lisa screamed in terror, but the ghost shrieked even more pitifully. It had burned its hand on the flame. When Lisa looked again, the ghost had disappeared. Yet Lisa proved truly courageous. She refused to move out despite these supernatural encounters.

At that very moment, a pink truck rushed by, flashing her entirely with paint. When she saw her reflection in the water, she had truly transformed into a pink unicorn. Her enchanting appearance quickly went viral. Even the director of a talent agency came personally to find her. But right before the performance began, paint around her mouth started peeling. She hurried to the restroom to retouch the pink coating, only to be spotted by an assistant. The assistant handed Helma a photo. Helma in her unicorn costume threw a bucket of water at the girl, completely revealing her true identity. The assistant captured Helma's humiliating state and threatened her if she didn't leave immediately, the video would go public. Left with no choice, Helma could only depart in silent. News of the missing unicorn spread rapidly through the town. People fell into panic, searching everywhere, but they never found any trace of her. No one could accept this reality. Even the donkey began posting missing notices. Just then she returned. This time she had fully regained herself. She no longer wished to live in disguise and decided to be herself once more. She stepped onto the stage as the pink unicorn removed the horn from her head, wipe the pink paint from her face and told everyone the truth. The audience was stunned. Then she sang a song she had written as an apology to all the Crowd raised glow sticks in support. Her singing moved everyone deeply. Even her rival was brought to tears.

It was the girl at the center of the stage who seized his gaze. After the show, he couldn't look away from Angela, leaving his own daughter flushed with embarrassment. The next day, Angela suggests hanging out at Anna's place. Anna warns her to hide or her father return. Angela deliberately leans closer to Lester, flaunting her youthful allure. Overwhelmed, Lester ends up eavesdropping outside his daughter's room. As the girl's converse, he hears Angela confess she likes men with muscle and gets so agitated he bumps against the door. Assuming the noise came from outside, the girls rush out to investigate, only to find Anna's name burning on the ground. Anna instantly knows it's the neighbor Ricky's work. Outwardly quiet and polite, but secretly using drugs behind closed doors. Meeting Ricky pushes Lester to reflect on his own existence. He envies how the boy lives without career pressures, while Lester remains trapped in midlife crisis and a loveless marriage. Knowing he's about to be fired, he quit or the company can terminate.
