The thing that you said before. The Holocaust. Holocaust? Yes. What is that? Raise your hand if you know what the Holocaust is. Raise your hand if anyone in this classroom has ever been shot at. Non-human. What about this? We were discussing the Holocaust. No, they won't be able to read that. We can try. The books are just sitting here. Look at their reading scores. And if I give your kids these books, I'll never see them again. If I do, they'll be damaged. What about these? Romeo and Juliet. That's a great gang story. No, not the books. This is what we give them. It is Romeo and Juliet, but is a condensed version. But even these. Look how they treat them. See how torn up they are? They draw on them. Miss Campbell, they know. They get these because no one thinks they're smart enough for real books. I don't have the budget to buy new books every semester when these kids don't return them. So what do I do? Buy their books myself? That's up to you, but you're wasting your money. Is there someone else I can speak to about this? Excuse me. I'm sorry, but I don't understand. Does the Long Beach Board of Ed agree that these books should just sit here and not be used at all? Let me explain. It's called site based instruction. It means that I and the principal each have the authority to make These kinds of decisions without having to go to the board, who have bigger problems to solve. Do you understand how it works now? Sorry. I didn't mean to overstep your authority. I would never do that. I just. I don't know how to make them interested in reading with these. You can't make someone want an education. The best you can do is try to get them to obey, to learn discipline. That would be a tremendous accomplishment for them.

Dad called. Your mother's planning to come anyway, she says. You can't stop a mother from seeing her daughter's wedding. I knew she meant it. For 28 years, she made sure I knew my place. Rachel's punching bag, both literally and emotionally. But I wasn't seven anymore. The morning of my wedding. My hands trembled as I applied lipstick. It hit me that this day would either be everything I dreamed of or the final break with my family. So when mom and Rachel arrived early, I took a deep breath and smiled like nothing had ever been wrong. I'm so glad you made it, I said, hugging them both. You have to see how beautiful everything turned out. I showed them around the lobby, pointing out the flowers and the way the sunlight hit the stained glass. The bridal sweets over here, I said, keeping my tone light. You can see the aisle from this angle. It's perfect. Right? Then I LED them toward the nursery. And remember the room I mentioned? The one with the perfect view of the ceremony. You'll love this. The room was just as I planned. Soft lighting, padded carpet, a big screen showing the ceremony room. I smiled as they stepped inside. It's soundproof, I said. Parents can bring their babies here and still hear everything from the main hall. Mom walked in first, Rachel close behind, still talking about the decorations. I'll step out to the reception hall and say something. So you can test how well it works, I said, keeping my tone light. They both nodded, turning towards the screen. I slipped out, hold the door closed and turn the lock. For a second, I just stood there, palm flat against the cool metal, my heart pounding so hard it hurt. Twenty eight years of being the good daughter ended with one small click. The pounding started immediately. Mom's muffled yelling, Rachel's ha, ha! Ha! Echoing through the padded walls. But those walls were built to muffle crying babies, and they worked. I walked back to the bridal suite. The makeup artist glanced up, startled at my calm face. For the first time in my life, silence didn't mean waiting for the next outburst. It meant peace. I stepped into my dress. It felt like armor. An hour later, I stood at the altar, watching my husband's face as he read his vows. His voice never wavered. Every word exactly as he'd written them, exactly as I'd dreamed. The ceremony was perfect silence. After the reception, I played dumb. Oh, my god, that door has been sticking! I told the venue about it last week. Thank goodness you could watch on the screen. Mom's face turned red. She didn't speak, just glared like I'd committed murder. After I forced her to watch my husband's parents walk me down the aisle. Before mom left the church that day, she cornered me, her face twisted with rage. You're dead to me, She hissed, I smiled. Yeah, I Learned from the best.

That's impossible! Frank shouted. Your grandmother would never. She did. Three months before she died. She transferred the deed, had it witnessed and notarized, filed it with the county. Why didn't anyone know? Sarah demanded. Because grandma asked me to keep it quiet. She wanted to see what Frank would do. Whether he'd honor her wishes or try to cash out this. This fraud. Frank slammed his hand on the table. You manipulated her. She was senile. She wasn't senile. I have medical records proving she was mentally competent. Her doctor signed off. Her lawyer was present at the transfer. What lawyer? Martin Chen. He's been the family attorney for 30 years. You know him? Frank pulled out his phone, started dialing. Don't bother, I said. He's expect in your call. I told him this conversation was happening today. Frank's finger hovered over the screen. Grandma knew you'd sell, I continued. She told me about the developer who'd been calling you for years. She knew you'd take it the second she was gone, so she gave it to you. Tim asked. Why you? Because I'm the only one who visits the farm every week. Who fixes the fences, who mows the fields. Who actually gives a damn about keeping it alive. Frank pointed a shaking finger at me. You conned an old woman. I took care of an old woman while you were planning her estate sale. Every Sunday for five years, I was there. Where were you? Silence! I asked her once why she didn't just leave it to all of us. I said, you know what she told me? I'm leaving it to the one who'll fight for it. The rest will just fight over it. Sarah started crying. This isn't fair! What's not fair is Frank telling everyone the farm is his when he never bothered to check. What's not fair is 40 people nodding along while he plans to pave over grandma's legacy for a shopping mall. Two million dollars! Frank shouted. Do you know what that could do for this family? I know exactly what it would do. You take the money, divide it up, and in five years nobody would remember there was ever a farm. So what are you going to do? Tim asked quietly. Keep it? Yeah, I'm keeping it. You can't afford that, Frank said. You're a teacher. You make nothing. I make enough. Full story on the channel linked below.

My sister Rachel has Tourette's. That makes her elbow. People stomp and yell ha, ha, ha! Loud enough to stop conversations three rooms away. It started long before I ever understood what it meant. When I was seven, one of her tics grabbed my hair and slammed my head into the wall. Mom didn't ask if I was okay. She just sighed and said, she's having such a hard day. Go play in your room. That moment started a pattern that never stopped. Rachel lashed out, I took it, and mom pretended not to see. Then last winter, I got a taste of a different kind of love. It was New Year's Eve when my. My boyfriend got down on one knee right as the fireworks exploded. He held my face in his hands and said, you deserve to be someone's first priority. I sobbed so hard I could barely say yes. For three days, I called friends, posted pictures, and planned venues. Once, I wasn't the family shock absorber. I was just Lisa, a woman in love planning her perfect day. Then my mom called. I've been saving for this since you were little. Let me pay for everything. Her voice tripped, honey, but I should have heard the poison underneath. We talked flowers and venues for 20 minutes before she dropped it. Of course Rachel will be your Maid of honor standing right behind you during the ceremony. I'm paying so I get to choose at least one bridesmaid. That's the rule. In that instant, every memory I tried to bury came barreling back. See, with Rachel, you had to know the right distance. Three feet was safe from the elbow. Five feet protected you from the stomping. Zero feet meant blood. When I was 12, Rachel threw a dinner plate at my face during Christmas. Seven stitches above my eyebrow. But I had to clean up the blood while mom comforted her. By 16, I Learned to back up everything twice because her stomping tick had destroyed too many of my things. Mom bought Rachel weighted blankets and therapy lamps and told me to be understanding. At 22, I watched Rachel elbow a pregnant woman at our cousin's wedding. The woman doubled over crying, but mom told everyone she was being dramatic. That's when I realized mom wasn't just enabling her. She was protecting the chaos because it kept her in control. So I told her no. Rachel could come to the reception, the rehearsal dinner, everything except the ceremony. I even offered the church nursery so she could watch on a TV screen that. I'm not paying for anything. Mom snapped. Fine, I said. My fiance and I will cover it. The next three weeks were hell. Mom called relatives saying I was able to. And cruel. She showed up at my apartment with Rachel To practice being calm. Ten minutes later, Rachel's elbow shattered my living room mirror. Shards of glass everywhere. This is what happens when you stress her out. Mom shouted, she's picking up on your rejection. The night before the

My 16 year old Sophie had been begging for AirPods Pro all summer, the new 300 dollar model. She'd researched every feature, watched countless unboxing videos, even created a detailed comparison chart showing why the Pro version was essential for her aesthetic. Her birthday arrived and I surprised her with the exact model. I was so proud finding them in stock when they'd been sold out everywhere. Her face dropped the second she opened the box. Um, these are the regular AirPods Pro. She held them like they were defective. I specifically said I need the AirPods Pro Max. Everyone at school has the Max version now. These make me look poor. The Max version. This kid wanted the $600 over ear headphones that cost more than my car payment. Her music career consisted of making 15 second TikTok dance videos to trending songs. The Pro version has the same sound quality I explained trying to salvage the moment. These are what actual musicians use for professional work. Mom, nobody cares about sound quality. It's about the look. These tiny earbuds are so basic. The max ones are a statement piece. Was already putting them back in the box. Can you just return these and get the right ones? It's only like 300 bucks more. Only 300 bucks more. Like I was made of money that's stung deep. I'd specifically researched which model music professionals recommended. I'd read reviews, compared features. Even asked my friend who works in audio production. I'll think about it, I said quietly, taking the box from her. She was already back on her phone. Thanks, mom. You're the best. Make sure you get the space grey ones, not silver. Silver looks cheap on camera. I just nodded and walked away. Next day, I'm at Apple store standing in the return line, still feeling terrible about the whole situation. The line was moving slowly and I could hear the customer service conversation happening ahead of me. I'm sorry, ma'am, your card was declined again. Do you want to try a different payment method? I looked up from my phone. A woman about my age wearing scrubs with Maria embroidered on them was standing there with her teenage son. He couldn't have been older than 15, wearing a faded band T-shirt and holding her hand supportively. Um, let me try this one, Maria said, pulling out a different card. Her hands were shaking slightly. Sorry, Miguel. I thought I had enough after paying rent. This one declined too, the employee said gently. The boy immediately stepped forward. It's okay, mom. I don't really need new earbuds for school. My old ones still work fine for online classes. Maria's shoulders sagged like someone had just crushed her dreams. Miho, you've been using those broken earbuds for two years. The left one doesn't even work anymore. And you need them for your virtual music lessons. Maybe next month I'll have Better tips from work, she said, her voice cracking. Your music teacher said you have real talent. You deserve proper equipment. Mom, sharing one earbud with my study group is fine. Besides, my music sounds better when we listen to.

My wife Jenna has this thing where she's always late, not just fashionably late, but like 30 to 45 minutes late to everything, dinner with friends, movies, work meetings, family gatherings, you name it, she's gonna be late for it. It drives me absolutely insane. The worst part is how she acts about it like it's no big deal. She'll roll her eyes when I tell her we need to leave, say, relax, babe, we have time, when we absolutely don't, and then get mad at me for being stressed about it. I've started telling her events start an hour earlier than they actually do, but she caught on and now just shows up even later. Last month was the breaking point. We were supposed to meet my parents for my dad's birthday dinner at this nice restaurant. I told her we needed to leave by 6:30 to get there on time. At 7:15, she's still doing her makeup, telling me to chill out because they'll wait for us. We showed up at 8:20. My parents had already ordered appetizers and were halfway through their main course. My dad looked hurt, my mom was pissed, and I wanted to disappear. But two weeks ago, something happened that Jenna had been talking about for months. Her favourite singer was doing this acoustic set at a tiny venue downtown She'd been refreshing the ticket page for weeks trying to get seats and somehow managed to snag two tickets when someone cancelled last minute. She was beyond excited, posting about it on Instagram every day, telling everyone at work about it. The show was at eight PM on a Saturday. The venue was small, maybe 50 people max, and they were super strict about their no late entry policy.

Then he said the thing that really set everything in motion. He told me I had until tomorrow to clear out my desk because he was done with my attitude and I was fired. He actually used air quotes when he said attitude. He told me I could either resign quietly or he'd make sure I never worked in this city again because he had connections everywhere. I just nodded and said okay. He seemed surprised I didn't argue. Then got even matter and told me to get out of his office. I went back to my desk and started packing while everyone watched. Janet was literally crying and Miguel kept saying this wasn't legal. Derek came out of his office and announced to everyone that this was what happened to people who couldn't follow simple rules.

He walked closer and said loud enough for everyone to hear that maybe daddy could get me a job at McDonald's since I couldn't handle real work. He was still laughing when my dad asked who Was firing me. And I said, Derek, the new supervisor. Derek was doing this fake crying voice saying, Boohoo, daddy, they're being mean to me. When my dad's tone changed completely, whole floor went silent, but Derek was still chuckling. When my dad asked to speak to Derek directly, I handed him the phone and Derek took it while smirking at everyone like this was the funniest thing ever. He said, yeah, this is Derek in a cocky voice. My dad's voice came through clear as day asking Derek to please explain why he was firing his son. Derek's laugh cut off mid breath. Face started doing this thing where it went from red to white to red again. He dropped the phone and I had to pick it up. Derek started stuttering and saying he didn't know and there must be some misunderstanding. My dad told him the only misunderstanding was Derek thinking he had any authority left in this building and that security would be up in 5 minutes to escort him out. Then my dad asked me to come up to his office on the top floor. Derek tried to follow me to the elevator saying we could work this out and he was just trying to maintain standards. I told him the only standard he maintained was being consistently terrible to everyone. Security showed up right as the elevator doors closed.

I said, prove it. Then I moved out that night and started dating her untouchable model friend who had been secretly in love with me. I, 29, ma'am, was washing dishes last Wednesday when my fiance, Kelsey, 27, dropped the most arrogant statement I'd ever heard. We were arguing about her spending one $200 on a designer bag when we were supposed to be saving for the wedding. She slammed her fresh manicure on the counter. You know what, Ethan? I could replace you in 24 hours. Literally. Guys are lined up waiting for me to be single. You should be grateful I even chose you. I stopped washing, turned off the water, dried my hands slowly. Prove it. She laughed. That mean girl. Laugh. What? You said 24 hours. Prove it. We're done. Clock starts now. I checked my phone. 7:23 p m. Wednesday. Her face went through confusion, amusement, anger, then smug confidence. You're bluffing. You can't even match your socks without me. I walked to the bedroom and started packing. She followed, listing reasons I'd fail. You don't know the Netflix password. Your mom likes me more. Good luck finding someone who looks like me. You're literally nothing without me. That last one made me pause. Not because it hurt, but because I realized she actually believed it. Three years fit in two suitcases and a backpack. As I was leaving, my phone buzzed. Adrian Kelsey's best friend. The one she called untouchable because she only dated millionaires. Heard you're single. Kelsey's already posting. You okay me heading to Jerome's? Adrian come to mine instead. We need to talk now. I showed up at 9 p m. She opened the door in sweats and a messy bun. Before you say anything, I need to tell you something I should have said two years ago. She showed me texts with Kelsey from 2022. My stomach dropped. Kelsey Ethan's getting too comfortable thinking about monkey branching to that lawyer guy from Pilates. Adrian that's messed up. Ethan's a good guy. Kelsey good. Doesn't pay for Mycanoe trips, but he's stable until I find better. Already added myself as authorized user on his AMX. Lol. There were dozens more plans to upgrade me. Her active hinge profile messages about backup guys, why didn't you tell me? I asked. I tried. Kelsey threatened to ruin me if I said anything. Then I've been in love with you since the day I introduced you to her, but I thought she'd be better for you. We talked until 4:00am. She let me crash in her guest room, and I watched Kelsey's replacement speed run. Our 1 6 thirst trap three different bars. Where are all the real men at? Videos got progressively sloppier. Our 7 to 16 matched with 30+ guys. Brought home some guy named Kyle who looked like he sold protein powder. Posted his back with upgrade already. I. Kyle left. She posted and deleted a crying selfie. Our 17 to 24 full panic. Texted me from three numbers. I win. I replaced you became. Can we talk? This isn't what I meant. At seven twenty three PM, Thursday, the 24 hour.

Good man. But there's a story that needs to be told correctly. The room went quiet. I could feel my heart starting to pound. Marcus looked confused, then nervous. October 2017, outside FOB Wilson, vehicle hit, an I E. D caught fire. Three soldiers trapped inside. Jenkins looked directly at me. Military police specialist was running route security that day, first on scene. I watched him run straight into those flames. No hesitation. Pulled out all three soldiers while ammunition was cooking off inside. Burned his hands. Smoke inhalation kept going back. My dad's face went pale. Jenkins continued. Sergeant Collins was there. He was in shock from the blast. We retreating him for head trauma. When the rescue happened, good soldier. But he froze, couldn't move. Totally normal response to an I E. D strike. The room was absolutely silent. Every eye shifted between Marcus and me. The paperwork got mixed up in the chaos. Wards clerk put the wrong name down. By the time anyone realized it, the ceremony had already happened and Sergeant Collins was stateside. Jenkins looked at Marcus. Sir, I think you know this deep down. Marcus's face went bright red. He stood up. Chair scraping loud against the floor. This is bullshit, his voice cracked. He grabbed his jacket and walked out. The door slammed behind him. Jenkins turned to me. We can get this corrected, get you the recognition you actually earned. I shook my head. I didn't Do it for medals. I just wanted them to come home. The words came out quieter than I meant. They had. Families in that room nodded. They understood. But my dad just sat there staring at that display case like it had turned into something poisonous. We drove home in complete silence. Marcus won't return my calls. Dad can't look at me. Last night, my mom finally said something. I always knew you did more than you told us. Six years. Six years of being invisible while my brother wore my moment around his neck. And now that everyone knows the truth, my family is fractured into pieces. The veterans respect me now, but I'd almost rather have my family back, even if it meant staying invisible forever.

I'm a military police specialist. My older brother Marcus is an infantry sergeant. We both deployed to Kandahar in 2,017. And he came home with a Silver Star. I came home to my dad asking if I'd written any speeding tickets or over there every Thanksgiving, every Christmas, every fourth of July barbecue for the past six years, that metal comes out. Dad keeps it in this fancy wooden display case and he sets it right in the middle of the table like a centerpiece. Marcus tells the story how he pulled three soldiers from a burning vehicle after an IEE strike, how he ran through flames while rounds were cooking off, how he saved three lives that day. And I sit there eating potato salad while dad beams and says things like, now that's a real soldier. That's what service looks like. Then he turns to me. You were just doing police work, right? Checking IDS at the gate. I'd correct him. I was route security, criminal investigations, detaining operations. He'd wave his hand, sure, sure. But Marcus was really in it. You know, my uncle once asked what I did over there. And before I could answer, dad jumped in. He was basically a cop, wrote reports while the real soldiers fought. Marcus never corrected him, just smiled and changed the subject. I stopped trying to explain what MPs actually do stopped mentioning the convoys, the raids, the times we were first on scene didn't matter. I wasn't infantry, so I wasn't really a veteran in their eyes. Last Tuesday, there was a veterans town hall at the VFW in our hometown, mental health resources, VA benefits, that, that kind of thing. Marcus and I both went. Dad came, too. And I swear to god he brought the metal case, set it on the table next to his coffee like he was Marcus's manager or something. During the open discussion, this guy in his 40s stood up, Corporal Jenkins. I recognized him immediately from our deployment. He'd been in Marcus's unit. I wanna talk about something that's been bothering me for years, Jenkins said. He pointed at.

I had no chance with her anymore. Thirty seconds left. Jack is still staring, still going, face getting redder. I grab paper and write the fastest note of my life to the teacher. My handwriting looks like a drunk spider, but whatever. Jack is doing inappropriate things aimed at me. Please help now. I fold it and speed walk it to Evans's desk, reads it. His eyes scan it once, twice. For a second, I think he understand what's going on. But then he scrunches it up and wraps it into a ball, throws it in the trash. Back to your seat now, sir. Please. Back to your seat. Jack is watching me walk back, still smirking, still going. He's not even trying to hide it anymore because he knows Evans won't do anything. The whole situation is about to get so much worse. And Evans is just sitting there grading papers. Lucy is passing notes. Now other kids are starting to notice. The whole room knows what's happening except the one adult who's supposed to stop it. I turn my chair sideways. Jack adjusts his angle like he's got some kind of targeting system. Mr Evans shouted again, face your chair forward. Last warning. He's about to. One more word and it's Saturday detention. Lucia stands up. Mr Evans, everyone, eyes on your own work. Jack's breathing got Faster. His face went from red to purple, his whole body tensing up. And I could see the exact moment he was about to lose it. Time slowed down. I could hear my heartbeat in my ears. I knew I had maybe three seconds before no nut November became the worst month of my life. I threw myself off my chair like I was dodging a dodgeball, hit the ground just as Jack finished his little personal project into his bookbag instead of my face. The room went dead silent except for the clock ticking and someone going, oh, my gosh. Fast forward a week later and Jack followed me into the bathroom and started doing it again. But he wasn't ready for the pocket snake that I threw at him. And let's just say he never lost no nut November again.

No nut November. I used to have a best friend named Jack. Everything was cool until he started making gay jokes. He wasn't even gay. He was just trying to be annoying. It started small at first. Normal joked about me being handsome and stuff like that. But within weeks, the a jokes became his new form of rage bait. He'd make jokes about how I want him. So when we both got detention at the same time, he kept calling it our detention date and making kissy faces when the teacher wasn't looking. We were five minutes into detention when his hand starts moving up and down under the desk at lightning speed and there's no paper on his desk. It was like he was asserting dominance or something, making sure I knew this was about me. He was breathing like he just ran a Marathon while sitting completely still. He looks up right at me, not a glance, full eye contact while his hand is still going full turbo under the desk. My brain just froze like when your computer shows you that spinning wheel of death. Then I noticed his chair. He's turned it toward me and the angle when he finishes, it's gonna hit my face. I had two minutes maybe less. Face was getting red. I tried to reach for the phone in my pocket to text someone to help but the teacher, Mr Evans notices instantly. Phone on my desk. Now Mr Evans has a radar for phones. I swear you know the rules. I walk up and put it on his desk, locks it in his drawer. Great. No lifeline, no evidence, no nothing. While I was walking back, I can see Jack tracking me with his eyes, that same smirk from when he'd make his stupid jokes. But his hand hasn't stopped moving. I get up real quiet and start moving to the empty seat behind him. Where do you think you're going? Evans doesn't even look up. It's a sign, seating only. Go back to your seat. Sir. Sir, I just need to, you need to apologize to Jack for disrupting his concentration and sit back down. Wait, what? I'm sorry. Go on, apologize. I look at Jack, his smirk gets bigger. Sorry, Jack. His voice comes out all breathy and weird. It's cool, bro. Good. Now sit down. The walk back felt like death row. Lucia, the girl I've had a crush on since freshman year, notices what's happening. Her face goes from confused to horrified to buried in her textbook.

Real family only. He said. My wife didn't defend me. I left the party early. By the time they needed me to co sign their mortgage refinance, I was already filing for divorce. My father in law waved me out of the frame. Step back, Jason. Real family only. I stood there holding Emma, my daughter, her first birthday, 50 people watching, pink balloons. My wife's entire family crowded around the cake. I'm her father. I said, you married in. That's different. Frank Jester impatiently. Blood relatives, come on, we're losing the light. My hands went numb. I looked at Sarah, my wife, waiting for her to say something. He avoided my eyes, reached over and took Emma from my arms. The room went silent. 50 people watched me step aside. Frank positioned everyone, smiled, cracked jokes, took a dozen photos. I stood alone against the wall, an outsider at my own daughter's birthday. When the photos finished, Frank walked past me. Nothing personal, just want the bloodline documented properly. I found my keys. Sarah caught me at the door. Where are you going home, Jason? Don't be dramatic. It's just a photo. Your father called me an outsider and you handed him our daughter. He's old fashioned and you're my wife. You should have defended me. She crossed her arms. You're making this bigger than it is. I stared at her, really looked at Her? No. I'm finally seeing it clearly. I left, sat in my driveway for 20 minutes, hands shaking, and I called my lawyer. Monday morning, I filed for divorce. Sarah got served at work. On Thursday, she called me screaming, are you insane? No. I'm done being treated like I don't belong in my own family. Over a photo, over 3 years of being disrespected while you watched. We can fix this. You had your chance when your father called me an outsider. You could have said something. You didn't. I hung up. Her mother called the next day. You're being selfish. Think about Emma. I am thinking about Emma. I'm thinking she deserves a father who doesn't teach her it's okay to let people disrespect her husband. You're tearing this family apart. Your husband did that. When he made it clear I'm not family, I blocked her number. Two weeks of lawyers, mediation, Sarah crying, her family calling me every name in the book. I didn't care anymore. Then Frank called. I almost didn't answer. Jason, we need to talk about what our mortgage, the banks requiring us to refinance. Interest rates went up. His voice.

You wanted blood relatives only. Go ask one of them. None of them qualify. Not my problem. We don't refinance, we lose the house. My heart pounded. Three years of humiliation.

She stood by while you humiliated me. Listen, you wanted real family only, Frank. Well, congratulations. Now you get to find out what that actually means. I hung up. Sarah called immediately.

Watching your father in law erase you from your daughter's birthday while your wife stands there silent. I didn't know what to say. My voice went cold. You could have said, dad, that's my husband. He stays in the photo. Four years together. And you couldn't manage that. She started crying. If you ever loved me. I did love you, past tense. The woman I loved would have defended me. Jason, they're my parents and I was. Your husband was. I hung up. Three days later, the bank rejected their refinance application. Frank called one last time. You're really going to let us lose everything? I thought about Emma's first birthday, standing against that wall, 50 people watching me get erased. No, Frank, you already lost everything. You just didn't realize it until you needed me. Please tell me again how I'm not real family. The line went quiet. That's what I thought.

So my whole family had been using my Amazon Prime account for like three years. My mom, my sister Ashley, my Uncle Rick, even my grandma somehow figured out how to order stuff. I was paying for it because I actually use Amazon all the time for work stuff and groceries. But they were just leeching off it. The breaking point happened two weeks ago. I check my account and see 17 packages coming to different addresses, 17. My sister ordered a whole workout set she'll never use. My mom got some fancy face cream that cost 60 bucks. And my Uncle Rick ordered a drone he definitely doesn't need. But the worst part was my cousin Blake ordered a gaming chair that cost $400. I called Blake and asked him what the hell he was thinking. He just laughed and said it's not his problem. I gave everyone access, said if I didn't want people using it, I shouldn't have shared the password. This kid just graduated high school and acts like he runs the world. So I called my mom and told her everyone needed to chip in for prime or get their own accounts. She got all dramatic and said family should help each other out. She reminded me how she used to buy me clothes when I was younger. I told her that was literally her job as a parent and not the same thing at all then Ashley calls me crying, saying she can't afford her own prime account because she's saving for a wedding. I reminded her that her wedding is in two years and she just spent $300 on workout clothes she returned last month. She said I was being petty and that it's only like $10 a month split between everyone. I did the math. If everyone chipped in 10 bucks, that would actually cover prime and give me extra money. But when I suggested this in our family group chat, suddenly everyone had excuses. My mom said she's on a fixed income. Ashley said she's saving for the wedding. Rick said he barely uses it anyway, which is a lie because he ordered protein powder just yesterday. The final straw was when my grandma called me confused about why her soap order got cancelled. Turns out my account got flagged for suspicious activity because there were so many different addresses. Amazon temporarily locked my account and I couldn't order my medication refills.

He said if I claimed damage I didn't cause, I could get in serious trouble. Fines, maybe even criminal charges. He told me not to do it. I also posted about it online without details, and two people who said they were lawyers said the same thing. When Jenna came back three days later, I told her I couldn't do it. She started crying, saying she was going to have to declare bankruptcy. She kept saying it was just insurance and they have money and it wouldn't hurt anyone. I felt horrible, but I kept saying no. She got angry and said I was being selfish and that friends help each other. I told her I could help her find a payment plan with the building or maybe a lawyer, but I couldn't lie on an insurance claim. He left and didn't talk to me for two days. Then she showed up again. This time Ashley was with her. They both sat on my couch, and Ashley apologized for causing the whole mess. She said she felt terrible and knew it was her fault. Then Jenna started again about the insurance. She said the building gave her two weeks to pay $8,000 as a down payment or they would start legal action. She really did think she would go bankrupt. I looked at both of them and said I already talked to professionals and They all said this was fraud. I couldn't do it. Ashley got mad. Then she said I was letting Jenna's life get ruined over something that wouldn't even affect me. I asked how it wouldn't affect me if I committed fraud. She. I didn't have an answer. They both left, and Jenna didn't talk to me for another week. During that time, our whole friend group was weirdly quiet. I later found out Jenna had told everyone I was refusing to help her and made it sound like I was the bad guy. Finally, one of our mutual friends named Chris texted me asking what actually happened. I explained everything, including the fraud part. He said that made sense and he didn't blame me. Apparently, Ashley's parents ended up giving her money to pay for half the damage, and Jenna got a payment plan with the building for the rest. She didn't go bankrupt. She didn't even miss any rent payments. But she never apologized to me for asking me to commit fraud twice.

My friend Jenna and I both moved into the same building after college. She got the fourth floor and I got the third one. Saturday morning, she texted our whole friend group saying she wanted to do a rooftop barbecue. She had done these before, but I never went because I don't eat red meat. This time I figured I should actually show up. So I grabbed chips and paper plates from the store. The barbecue was nice. Everyone was drinking and laughing. Our friend Ashley brought this huge grill and cooked burgers and hot dogs for everyone. I just ate the chips I brought and hung out. Around 9 at night, we all went down to Jenna's apartment to watch some reality show about people stuck on an island. Before we left the roof, Jenna and Ashley talked about leaving the grill up there to cool down overnight. They said they would grab it tomorrow. Made sense to me, so I didn't think about it. The show ended around midnight and I went back to my apartment and crashed. The next morning, I woke up to this long email from building management. There was a fire on the roof last night. Someone had dumped hot coals into the plastic trash can up there and the wind made them catch fire again. The email said they had camera footage and key card records and they knew exactly who was responsible. Screenshot The email and sent it to Jenna. She immediately called me freaking out. Apparently after I left, she and Ashley decided to take the grill home that same night. Instead of waiting, Jenna gave Ashley her keys to go up and get it. Ashley thought the coals were cool enough so she just dumped them in the trash can on the roof. The building was saying Jenna was responsible because it was her guest using her key card. The email said the damage was around $15,000. New roof section, new trash area, new door because the smoke messed up the sensors. A week went by and Jenna came to my apartment. She looked terrible, like she hadn't been sleeping. She asked if I could claim the fire damage on my renters insurance. I was confused at first. She explained that neither her nor Ashley had renters insurance and the building was threatening to sue her. She said if I claimed it on mine, we could just say I was up there, too and it would all go away. I told her I needed to think about it. I called my old insurance agent from when I lived with my parents. He was this older guy who always gave me good advice. I explained the whole situation.

I was 13 when I heard my mom tell her friend Linda that having three kids was her biggest regret. They were drinking wine on the patio. Thought I was at basketball practice. But coach canceled, so I came home early. If I could do it over, I'd stop at one, my mom said, laughing like it was funny. Maybe two. But three? That broke me. I'm the third kid. I stood behind the sliding door, basketball still under my arm, listening to my mother explained how I ruined her life. How she was finally getting her career back after my sister. Then my brother came along and set her back again. But she managed. Then I happened. Birth control failure. She called me like I was a defective product. Linda asked which kid she'd keep if she had to choose. My mom didn't even hesitate. Sophia, obviously. She's going to Yale next year. Pure genius, that one. What about the boys? Tyler. Sweet. Good at sports. Easy kid. She took another sip. But Ryan, he's just there. Doesn't excel at anything. Mediocre grades. No real talent. Sometimes I look at him and think, what's the point? What's the point of me, her son? I went to my room and didn't come out for dinner. When my dad knocked, I pretended to be asleep. But I wasn't sleeping. I was replaying every moment that suddenly made sense. Why my baby? Pictures stopped after age 2. Why? Sophia got a car for her 16th birthday. Tyler got a motorcycle for his, and I got a used bike from Craigslist. Why? They went to every one of Tyler's football games. I couldn't remember when my art show was. The next morning, I tested something. I told them I needed money for a field trip. $20. Ask your father, mom said. Without looking up from her phone. Ask your mother, dad said. From behind his newspaper. Tyler walked in. Hey, I need new cleats. How much? Mom immediately asked. Like, 80 bucks. She pulled out her wallet. Here's 100. Get good ones. I stopped asking for things after that. Two months later, report cards came out. I got straight b's. Best ever. I was so proud. Worked really hard for those grades. Left it on the kitchen counter where they'd see it. It sat there for a week, untouched. Tyler brought home a C plus in English. Mom hired him a tutor that same day. We can't let your grades slip, honey. You've got scholarships to think about. But the moment that broke me. My 14th birthday. They forgot. Not like they got the date wrong. They literally forgot I existed. That day, Sophia was visiting from college. Tyler had a game. They all went out to celebrate his winning touchdown. Posted family photos on Facebook. So proud of our kids. The caption read, I was.

My uncle told me buy old muscle cars and fix them up for cheap. There's only so many left and you'll get more car for your money than any new ride. When I was 22, I just landed my first decent job at a tech startup and got approved for a loan on a brand new luxury sedan. Everyone my age was driving German cars, showing off their success with monthly payments they could barely afford. But pulled me aside at a family barbecue. Uncle wasn't the type to talk much, but he always had some cool old car project going, so I figured he knew what he was talking about. I followed him over to his garage and watched him point at a beat up muscle car covered in a tarp. He explained that pile of rust cost me $2,000 in 1995, sold it last month for $140,000. Your fancy new car will be worth half what you pay the moment you drive it off the lot. These old beauties only go up if you know what you're doing. That conversation stuck with me for weeks, thinking about what uncle said while I was looking at all these shiny new cars at the dealership. Finally, I called them up and cancelled my loan approval. Instead of putting money down on a luxury sedan, I started hunting for old muscle cars I could actually afford to buy and fix up Within two months, I bought three rusted out classics from the late 60s. There was a Camaro that wouldn't start, a Corvette with a blown engine and a Chevelle that looked like it had been sitting in a field for decades. Parents were mortified when neighbors started complaining about the junkyard in our driveway. My friends thought I'd lost my mind. Every time we hung out, they wouldn't shut up about their new rides. They'd show off their leather seats and touch screens while roasting my cars. One friend laughed and said I'd never get any girls driving rust buckets like that, only cougars who were into vintage stuff. Another kept saying I looked like I was collecting scrap metal, not chicks brag about their heated seats and backup cameras, then joke that the only feature my cars had was breaking down. I'll admit there were moments pulling up next to their shiny Bmws that I wondered if uncle was wrong. But then I'd remember that 140,000 dollar sale and I stayed determined to prove them all wrong. For four years, I spent nights and weekends in Uncle's garage learning how to fix these things, welded engine work, paint, whatever I needed to know, started hitting up car auctions to see what stuff was actually worth. My social life pretty much ended because they all thought I was too broke to hang out with them. So while my friends were posting pics of their fancy interiors and complaining about 1,400 Monthly payments, I was covered in grease trying to get these rust buckets running. Slowly, I started recognizing patterns and what collectors wanted. The models I bought weren't just any old cars. They were the specific ones that were getting harder and harder

I only did this to test whether he was really blind, because every night when I went to bed, I felt someone staring at me from behind, and there was a hole poked through the paper on the door, with faint breathing sounds outside. But whenever I opened the door to check, there was nothing out there. And besides me and the old man in this house, there was no other living thing. So I suspected he was pretending to be blind and watching me whenever I fell asleep. But when the 53 degree liquor hit his eyes, he he did not react at all. Then I tried another test. While helping him walk, I deliberately guided him the wrong way. I even put a bright floral coat on him and played with a knife right in front of him. But none of it worked. He acted exactly like a real blind man, which meant he could not be spying on me. To clear my doubts once and for all, I went to the village priest for help. After hearing everything, he swore the old man had been blind for decades and said it was impossible for him to do such things. He thought I was just too suspicious and told me to go back and take good care of him. But that very night after I returned, I Heard sounds outside the door again and another new hole appeared, so I grabbed my knife for Protection and quietly leaned toward the hole. No matter whether it was a person or a ghost, I was determined to find out this time. But when I opened the door, there was still no one outside. I started wondering if I was hallucinating. But as the days passed, more and more holes appeared in the door, and I looked worse and worse. Every day I tried new ways to test the old man, but could not find a single flaw, so I stopped sleeping at night and kept staring at the door. The moment I heard a sound outside, I opened the door with my knife in hand, and when I saw nothing I shut it fast, terrified something might slip in and hurt me. But this time when I turned around, I suddenly saw the old man lying on my bed.

Annie told her boyfriend that they would meet again in 2,000 years. Annie closed the coffin and then safely sealed it in the ground with a chain. She then buried him 5,000 meters below the ground. Soon, 2,000 years had passed. One day, construction workers suddenly discovered a coffin. They looked at the coffin wrapped in chains. They began to get excited. They thought they had found a great treasure. But just as they were about to cut the chains, a strange scene happened. As soon as they blinked their eyes, and then they all fainted on the ground. As the white mist continued to spew out, they unknowingly released the vampires inside. The workers were instantly shocked by the scene. However, what they didn't know was the vampire had been sleeping for 2,000 years. After the vampire drained their blood, he used his memories to find the place where he used to live, and he met the butler at the door. Then he used magic to control the butler. He ordered the butler to take him inside when he saw that the decoration of the castle was exactly the same as in the past. As he walked slowly into the parlor, he saw two children relaxing on a sofa. But after 2,000 years of slumber, Jack didn't know anything about modern dress. Then Jack angrily asked the butler, when did they make it a Rule to date. In the middle of the night. At this point, his brother was horrified to realize that the strange man in front of him was the same as his ancestors portrait on the wall. Jack was overjoyed at the sight. His descendants remembered him. He then reintroduced himself to them. At that moment, the owner of the estate appeared. She interrupted their conversation. Kelly suddenly noticed this particular man. She was very distrustful of Jack. Kelly thought Jack was a fraud. She thought Jack was a fraud because he was dressed so strangely. Then she asked Jack what he was doing here. But Jack was in no hurry to answer her. Instead, he looked at the room with surprise. He was familiar with the room, but at the same time he didn't know it. He told Kelly that he knew everything about this place. But Kelly still didn't believe Jack. He would use any excuse to come to the castle. Kylie had seen it happen too many times. So she quietly hid the dagger behind her back. Jack saw that Kelly didn't believe him. He had to find another way to prove himself. Then he flipped a switch behind the statue. Soon there was a door that slowly opened. Jack was puzzled. There were all kinds of toys in the room. The room that he had prepared so carefully had become a utility room. Jack spat angrily. He felt Kelly was insulting his art. But Kelly didn't trust Him completely. Jack. In order to prove his identity again, he had to reveal his secret. Then he put the stick to the switch on the floor. And with the flip of the switch, the mural on the wall slowly opened. Then she saw a mysterious door behind the fireplace. Kelly was shocked at the sight. Could Jack really be her ancestor? Kelly slowly let her guard down against Jack. Jack LED Kelly to the depths of the secret passage. The chamber was filled with countless jewels, all kinds of expensive portraits and bottles. Jack told Kelly the real reason he was here. Then he wanted to use the wealth to help his descendants. Soon Kylie agreed to his request. The next day, the site was discovered. In addition to the reporters and the police at the scene of the crime, there was also a very suspicious woman.

Oh, it hurts. I know. I know. Ah, fuck. Millie suddenly spotted a pair of shoes outside the stall and immediately realized they'd been seen by a student who'd come in to use the bathroom. The two held their breath, waiting quietly for the student to leave. As soon as the student was gone, Millie wrenched herself free from Tim's grasp. I'm sorry. But before they could even catch their breath, they heard footsteps approaching the bathroom again. Milly quickly gestured for Tim to climb onto the toilet, then took charge of dealing with whoever was outside. This time it was Mister Pete, their teacher. Millie instantly pretended to have a stomachache. Mister Pete didn't ask any extra questions, just told the other students to head out first, even though he noticed someone else was in the stall with her. He ultimately let Millie off the hook, only reminding her not to accidentally walk into the men's restroom again.

The next day, a woman accidentally scratched her wheel, and as she complained about having to buy a new tire, the man pulled out the purple crayon from his pocket and started drawing circles in the air. The next second, a tire appeared out of nowhere, saving the money. That night, the man wanted to show off the magical crayon in front of his son, so he casually drew a butterfly in the air. Then with a light blow, the butterfly flapped its wings, coming to life. At first, the boy was skeptical, but when he took the purple crayon and drew his favorite little animal and blew gently, the creature he drew came to life. Then, to make sure his son could also make wishes come true, the man gave him half of the crayon. Soon, the crayon was put to good use. After school, he was stopped by two bullies who then shoved him into the storage room. The boy suddenly remembered the purple crayon in his pocket, and the next second, a monster suddenly broke through the storage room door, scaring the bullies away as they quickly ran off. Back home, the sun said he wanted to fly in the sky, and the man thought it was a great idea, so he took out the purple crayon. And started drawing in an open space. He kept drawing, and soon the shape of an airplane appeared. Then the man pulled the propeller.

No. If I'd done the surgery we planned, it's likely that down the line, we would have lost Emily and your daughter. Dr. Robbins, Did everything within her power for your wife.

I was still half asleep and confused when I realised what happened. I tried to explain, but he cut me off. You're literally just laying in blood right now. That's disgusting. I got up immediately, took a shower and changed into a disc. When I came back to bed, he wouldn't even look at me. He just rolled over and went to sleep. I barely slept that night. The next day, I went to work and didn't hear from him at all, not a single text. Tuesday afternoon, he showed up at my apartment to talk. He sat down and told me that every time he thinks about me now, all he can picture is a child in a diaper. Then he asked if I used them, like if I peed in them. I said, of course not, they're just for periods. He said he didn't believe me and that I was hiding this gross fetish from him, that he wasted two years on our relationship. I tried explaining why I only wore them when he wasn't around, that I knew they weren't attractive. I even told him I'd stop using them completely because I loved him and didn't wanna lose him. He said he'd think about it, but then added that I needed to talk to my doctor about changing my birth control. He wants me on something that stops my period entirely because now the thought of me having one grosses him out. I told him I didn't wanna change my birth control. The one I'm on works great for me and I don't wanna mess with my hormones. Got really mad and said I was being selfish, that changing birth control is such a simple thing to do to make him feel better about our relationship. He kept pushing until I agreed to at least talk to my doctor. I have an appointment Friday, but I already know I'm not going to change it. My body, my choice, right? But now I'm sitting here wondering if I'm actually in the wrong. Like maybe I should have told him about the period underwear from the start or maybe I should just change my birth control to save the relationship. I don't know anymore.

She told me I had a strong defamation case if I could prove Ashley was lying. We started gathering evidence. Mike gave a written statement that I stayed at his place the night of the party. We had time stamps for my Uber rides showing I went straight from the party to Mike's apartment. My credit card showed I bought breakfast near Mike's house the next morning. There was no gap in the timeline where I could have been with Ashley. Patricia requested Ashley's medical records through legal discovery. Ashley fought it hard, but the judge ordered her to comply. Turns out Ashley wasn't even pregnant. She'd never taken a pregnancy test, never saw a doctor. The whole thing was completely made up. Patricia also found Ashley's search history from the week before she accused me. She'd been googling things like how to break up a family and can you go to jail for false accusations. We took all of this to court in September, filed a defamation lawsuit asking for damages. Ashley showed up with some cheap lawyer who clearly wasn't prepared. He presented everything, the timeline, the medical records, the search history, Mike's statement. Ashley's lawyer tried arguing that she was confused and made an honest mistake, you can't accidentally make up an entire pregnancy and assault story. The judge wasn't buying it. During her testimony, Ashley completely fell apart on the stand, started changing her story, contradicting herself, finally admitted she made Everything up because she'd actually cheated on Derek with his coworker and needed a cover story. He thought if she could make me look like the bad guy, nobody would question her. When she eventually claimed Derek wasn't the father, the courtroom went silent. Derek was sitting in the back and I watched his face go completely white. My parents were there, too, and my mom started crying. The judge ruled in my favor, ordered Ashley to pay me $50,000 in damages plus my legal fees, also issued a restraining order. Ashley and Derek broke up that same day. He called off the wedding and kicked her out of his apartment. Two weeks later, Derek showed up at my door. He looked terrible, like he hadn't slept in days, started apologizing and saying he should have believed me, that he was sorry for hitting me and cutting me off. My parents sent letters, too, saying they made a horrible mistake and wanted to rebuild our relationship. Part of me wanted to forgive them immediately because they're my family. But another part of me was still furious. They believed a lie without even hearing my side. They abandoned me when I needed them most. Derek, standing in my doorway now, asking if we can grab coffee and talk, says he'll do whatever it takes to make this right. I honestly don't know what to do.

I hired a lawyer. Jennifer reviewed everything and smiled with steel in her eyes. Your mother doesn't have a case. If she pursues this, we'll counter sue for financial abuse. We'll expose every transfer, every guilt trip, every manipulative text. We'll make this so ugly she'll wish she never picked up the phone. Two weeks before the wedding, the mortgage payment bounced. My credit dropped 30 points. The Tesla payment bounced. Next day, another hit. Then Jennifer discovered something. My mother had been making minimum payments with my money while telling relatives she was supporting her ungrateful daughter through hard times. She, I've been using my financial abuse to play the martyr. My mother's lawyer withdrew from the case after realizing she'd been lying to him. My father called. Where did all the money go, dad, I asked. I paid $150,000. Where is it? Silence. Your mother has expectations, he finally said, about how we should live. The trips, the furniture, the club memberships. She says, we've earned it. You could start by making your own payments, I said softly. You could start by being my dad. Instead of her accomplice, he hung up. My mother showed up at my bridal shower disheveled and desperate. Please, she begged in front of everyone. We need to talk. You need to leave, I said. When she wouldn't, Emily called the police. The wedding was perfect. My mother didn't. Come neither did my father. Their absence felt like the first honest thing they'd given me in years. Three months later, Jennifer emailed, your parents house went into foreclosure. The Tesla was repossessed. Your mother attempted to open a credit card in your name. I filed identity theft reports. Six months later, my father called from Nevada. I left. I'm divorcing her. I wanted to say I'm sorry, not just for the money, for not being your dad. A year after the wedding, I saw my mother at the grocery store. She looked like someone who'd been surviving instead of living. I'm sorry, she said. You were right about everything. I destroyed the best thing in my life because I couldn't stand not being the center of your world. I can't be part of your healing journey. I replied, not right now, maybe not ever. She nodded. You look happy. That's all I ever should have wanted for you. My credit recovered. John and I bought our own house. My father and I talk once a month, brief, honest conversations. My mother stood up at my rehearsal dinner and tried to destroy. Instead, she freed me and I've never looked back.

And when I read the submission, my girlfriend text me constantly and gets upset if I hang out with friends. I knew immediately it was about me. I sat in the back of study hall with my coffee opening submissions for The Truth Oath, the anonymous advice column I've been running for two years. Most were the usual stuff. My crush doesn't know I exist. My ex won't stop texting me. Easy problems with easy answers. I was good at this, better at fixing other people's relationships than my own. Owen and I had been together for eight months, but ever since my parents announced their divorce, I've been a mess, texting him constantly, getting anxious when he didn't respond. I even made him leave Jake's party last Friday because I was upset. I knew I was being too much. Owen had been patient, but lately he'd been distant. I clicked on the next submission. How do I tell my girlfriend she's suffocating me? My coffee cup stopped halfway to my lips. The submission sat in my drafts folder all week. I had to respond to it. It was my job. But how could I be objective about my own relationship? I started writing Monday night. It sounds like your girlfriend might be dealing with anxiety or stress. Before you end things, try talking to her honestly about how you feel. I published it Tuesday morning. By lunch, three people. Had commented online saying the advice was too soft. He should just dump her. One comment read, she sounds crazy. I deleted the comments, but the words stayed in my head. Was I crazy? Wednesday, oh asked if I wanted to study together after school. I said yes, desperate to act normal. But the whole time I was watching him for signs. Signs he was planning to break up with me. Signs he was just going through the motions. You okay? He asked at one point. You keep staring at me. I'm fine. But I wasn't fine. Thursday, I saw him talking to Ben by the gym. Ben showed Owen something on his phone and Owen shook his head, looking stressed. When Owen saw me watching, Ben put his phone away quickly. Hey, Owen said, walking over. What were you and Ben looking at? Nothing, just some video. He was lying, I could tell. That night I couldn't focus on anything. I kept refreshing the submission page to see if the person had responded to my advice. They.

She picked the wrong man. My fiance and I exchanged glances. I replied, perfect and got security to kick her out. The same night, she texted, don't forget the mortgage payment and the Tesla car loan payments are tomorrow. I stared at that text until my hands stopped shaking. On read over my shoulder, what mortgage? What Tesla? That's when six years of lies came pouring out. When I was 22, my mother called, crying dad made bad investments. They'd lose the house. Could I help? Just temporarily? I co signed a 60 thousand dollar mortgage refinance. Six months later, I co signed a 55 thousand dollar Tesla loan. Because he deserves something nice. I promised to make every payment. I'd never see a Bill except the backup. Automatic transfers from my account became the primary. $700 monthly for the mortgage, $800 for the Tesla, plus insurance, taxes, emergencies. Nearly $2,000 vanishing every month for six years. $150,000 of my money gone. I've been packing lunches and skipping trips, thinking I was saving for our wedding, but I was barely breaking even. Drowning while my mother pushed me under inch by inch. When I felt stressed about money, she'd say, you make good money, you're just bad with budgeting. She gaslit me into thinking I was the problem. John asked what I wanted to do. I logged into my bank and deleted every Automatic payment authorization. Then I screenshot the confirmation and sent it to my mother with one message. You said you weren't paying for the circus. I'm not paying for your life anymore. I blocked her number, turned off my phone, let John hold me while I shook apart. The next morning brought 17 missed calls on John's phone. My mother's friends, my aunts, cousins. The family network activated with one message. I was selfish, ungrateful. Destroying my family over one little disagreement. She'd recruited everyone to tell me so. Then my mother's lawyer sent a letter threatening to sue me for emotional distress and financial damage caused by my unwanted withdrawal of support.

He's so sweet, but naive. A few fake tears and he buys whatever I want. His mom suspects nothing. The prenup was almost too easy. By Christmas, the house is mine. He won't even see it coming. Not a threat. Just truth. I walked to my car, started the engine. Through the rearview mirror, I watched the glowing windows. The music pulsed faintly through the walls. Fifteen minutes later, the scream cut through the Vermont night. They opened it during the gift display. Leia tugged the ribbon, lifted the lid. Her hand froze. Noah leaned over, read the first line. The second, his face drained. What is this? He whispered. It's fake. Laya hissed. Someone's trying to. But his mother, Victoria, was already crossing the floor. These were forwarded to me this morning. From a stylist you hired. Wrong thread. Noah turned the pages, his jaw tight. The dates match. This is real. The music thinned. The violinist missed an entire beat. Laya's voice cracked. No, you don't understand. My sister Ashlyn did this. She's jealous. She's always. Stop! Noah's voice cut like a whip. You did this. You humiliated her today and thought no one would see who you really are. Every face turned. The DJ lowered the music. A child asked, mom, what's happening? Noah pulled a folded document from his jacket, set it on the table. This is an annulment petition. I already signed it. The crystal frame hit the floor, shattered. Laya's scream echoed across the water. Mom reached for her arm. Sweetheart, maybe we should step outside. Don't touch me! Laya cried. You all wanted this. Dad spoke quietly for the first time that night. You should apologize to your sister. Laya laughed, a sound so brittle it didn't reach her eyes. Apologize to her? She's not even family. Dad shook his head slowly. That's where you're wrong. By the time I got home, my phone had 26 missed calls. Mom, Dad, Lia's bridesmaids, even Noah's mother. I didn't check any of them. I hung my wine colored dress on a chair and stared at it. Still perfect, still untouched. Just like the lie I'd carried for years. That being invisible meant being worthless. Today they're all calling, and I'm the one who gets to ignore them.

She knocked and asked what was going on. I told her through the door that I was already asleep and she was being too loud. She did not think it was funny. She started banging on the door saying this was insane and that I couldn't lock her out of her own room. I reminded her that she'd been doing the exact same thing to me for three months and that maybe now she'd understand how annoying it was. She yelled that it wasn't the same because she had a reason and I was just being petty. I asked her what her reason was. She went quiet for a minute and then said she didn't owe me an explanation. So I told her she could sleep on the couch and think about it. She slept in her car that night. I know because I heard her started up around 1 in the morning and when I looked out the window, she was sitting in the driver's seat with the heat running. The next morning she came back in and said we needed to talk. I unlocked the bedroom door and let Her in. She sat on the bed and tried to tell me that what I did was way worse than what she did because I changed the locks without telling her. I asked her if she was serious right now. She said she wanted her key back. I said, sure, but only if she agreed to stop locking me out when I came home from work. She said that wasn't fair because she wasn't doing it to be mean. She just needed space sometimes I, I told her that space didn't mean locking your boyfriend out of the bedroom every night for months. We went back and forth like this for maybe 20 minutes before she finally admitted that she'd been talking to her ex on video calls at night and didn't want me around for it. She said it wasn't cheating because they were just friends now and I was being controlling by having a problem with it. I handed her a trash bag and told her she had until the end of the day to get her stuff out.

The coffee maker, the toaster, the Instant Pot, even the living room curtains, because I bought and installed the rods myself. My friend Jake surveyed the increasingly empty apartment. This is brutal, they said. I contribute nothing. I'm just proving them right. Their belongings fit in small piles in the center of each room. One TV, one floor lamp, and scattered makeup products. I even powered on the TV they and so protective of and logged out of my Netflix account. Now it was all theirs. A black screen with nothing to watch. I took videos and photos of everything, texted them to Patricia with receipts attached. Leaving today. This is everything I'm taking, all purchased by me. Here's documentation. Keys will be with you by 5 p m. Six hours after we started, my room was empty. The common areas were bare, and their stuff sat in sad little islands on the hardwood floor. Everything they taken for granted was gone. The apartment echoed. I dropped my keys with Patricia in person. She looked at the receipts on her iPad, then at me. They told me you didn't contribute anything. Apparently, furniture doesn't count. She smiled. They're going to need your room filled immediate, or they'll have to cover your portion. That's $900 each extra per month. Good luck to them, I said. They won't find anyone, Patricia said quietly, Monday night, my phone exploded with locked numbers. I blocked them. Everywhere. But they were trying. From friends, phones, texting, apps, even email. Hundreds of messages. Accusations, threats, begging. I didn't open a single one. Patricia forwarded me their panicked messages. She stole everything. The apartment is empty. This is illegal. Patricia's response was beautiful. According to her receipts and the photos she provided before leaving, she only took items she purchased. You have until the end of the month to find someone for the third room, or you'll need to cover her rent. They tried finding someone for my room. But complaining about their ex roommate to every potential tenant isn't great marketing. By day 20, they still hadn't found anyone, and Patricia had already started making calls. She knew every landlord in our college town because they met monthly for coffee and shared information about problem tenants. Difficult tenants, she told them. Blamed their responsible roommate for everything. Couldn't make rent? Started drama with everyone. When the sisters couldn't come up with my portion of the rent, Patricia started the eviction process. They had two weeks to come up with the money or get out. Their apartment hunt went exactly as expected. Every application came back with the same responses. Sorry, just rented to someone else. We're going with other tenants.

I'm okay, I said quietly. She waved her hand. Don't be embarrassed. We're family. I'm just trying to help you. Ryan's dad nodded. You'd feel so much better. That's when Ryan's mom put down her fork and reached across the table to grab my hand. Sweetie, have you thought about weight loss surgery? Honestly, it would change everything for you. The entire table went silent. Even her friends looked uncomfortable. I stood up, and my chair made a loud scraping noise. If you wanna talk about bodies. My voice shook, but it was loud. Let's talk about yours. Ryan's mom blinked. Excuse me? Your face, I said. All that plastic surgery makes you look like you're wearing a mask. Your lips are so big you can barely close your mouth. And you look surprised all the time because you can't even move your forehead anymore. She gasped. I turned to Ryan's dad. And you. You sit there judging what I eat. When you breathe like you just ran a race. Every time you stand up, your stomach hangs over your belt. His face turned bright red. Ryan's sister tried to say something, but I cut her off. You post photos without me because you think you look better alone. But you dress like you're still in your 20s. When you're almost 40, everyone talks about how desperate you look. Ryan's mom had tears running down her face. His sister looked like she might throw up. His dad was Gripping his fork so hard his knuckles were white. I have been nothing but kind to you for three years while you picked apart every single thing about me. I said every meal, every photo, every comment, pretending to be concerned. You made me hate myself. You made me scared to eat. You made me feel worthless. And I'm done. Brian stood up next to me. For a second, I thought he'd apologize for me. Instead, he looked at his mom and said, she's right. You've been cruel to her since day one. And I let it happen because I didn't want to fight with you. That makes me just as bad. But I'm done now. We're leaving, and we're not coming back. His mom started crying hard. Ryan, we were just helping her. No, you were being bullies. He said, don't contact us. We're done. He grabbed my hand, and we walked out in the car. Ryan apologized over and over. He said he should have protected me years ago. Do you agree with them about my weight? I asked. He hesitated for just a second too long before saying no. Which told me everything I needed to know. I dumped him.

Oh, so you're just living here now? I paused my Netflix show and looked up. Megan stood in the doorway with her backpack still on, and Ashley hovered behind her, both of them wearing that weird synchronized glare they always got when they rehearsed something together. I do live here, I said, pausing my show. You're always out here using the TV, the couch, Ashley said. You contribute nothing to this place, but you sure act like you own it. I looked between them and noticed how they glanced at each other like this was all rehearsed. I decided not to engage. Okay. I grabbed my laptop and headed to my room. I figured they had a bad day, maybe bombed a test or something. Whatever it was, I'd let it blow over. Except 10 minutes later, Megan knocked once and opened my door without waiting for an answer. Starting now, she said, her voice cold and deliberate, you don't touch anything that isn't yours. Got it? I looked up from my bed. What? You heard me. Nothing that isn't yours. The door closed before I could respond. For eight months, I've been quietly furnishing our place, buying household items, covering utilities when they were short. I never made a big deal about it, but apparently I was the problem. The next day, I was in my room when I heard them in the kitchen. Patricia totally believed us. Megan said. I told her she's hostile and refuses to contribute. Ashley laughed, and I reminded her we were here first, so we get final say on who stays. Within an hour, Patricia called me. The girls think it's not working out. Maybe you should start looking for a new place. They want me gone? I asked. They've been here longer. They're saying you're difficult. I paid rent early every single month. Never a complaint from neighbors. But sure, I was the difficult one. I understand. I told Patricia. I'll handle it. I spent the next few days planning that weekend. Megan announced they were going to their cousin's wedding upstate. Three day weekend. They'd be leaving Friday morning, back Monday night. Perfect. Friday at 9:00am, their car disappeared around the corner. By 9:15, I had three friends with trucks pulling up. By noon, we were in full operation mode. The cow which they've been sprawled on every night. Mine. Bought it off Facebook Marketplace. Still have the messages. The kitchen table where Megan loved hosting her friends. IKEA receipt in my email. Assembled it myself with my dad when I moved in. So I just took the Wi-Fi router because my name was on the account.

I didn't even respond to that. Jake's dad called him again and said he was choosing me over his own sister. Jake told him he was choosing his child, his actual child that was about to be born. Danny sent me a long message saying I was ruining her special day and that I was keeping her brother from her on purpose. She said if something happened to me during labor, that Jake's parents could just drive me to the hospital. We live 40 minutes from the hospital. She really thought that was a solid plan. The wedding was yesterday. Jake stayed home with me. His parents went but didn't talk to us the whole week before. Danny posted pictures all day and Jake's whole family was in them. His mom posted a photo with just Danny, captioned, my only child who showed up. Jake's phone blew up from his cousins asking why he wasn't there. His aunt called him a bad brother. His uncle said he was whipped. Nobody cared that I could literally go into labor at any moment. Jake turned off his phone after the ceremony ended. We sat on the couch and he didn't say anything for like an hour. Then he just said his sister planned her wedding on purpose to prove a point, that she wanted to see if he'd pick her or me. I asked him if he regretted staying. He said No. Then his mom called my phone. I answered and she immediately started yelling that I stole her son from his family, that I trapped him with a baby, that Danny cried through half the reception because her brother wasn't there. I hung up. Jake took my phone and blocked his mom's number. Then he blocked Danny's number, too. He said if they couldn't understand why he stayed home two weeks before his kid was born, then he didn't need to hear from them. His dad texted him this morning saying, the family was done with us until we apologize to Danny. Jake deleted it without responding.

Photos, testimonials, income claims. She threw parties where nobody bought anything. She messaged old high school friends, trying to recruit them. People started avoiding her. By month six, we'd spent over $15,000 on products, training courses, and convention tickets. Jessica had made about $800 in actual sales. Most of that was from her mom buying stuff out of pity. I tried talking to her about cutting losses, but she'd get defensive. Said I didn't believe in her dreams, that I was comfortable being mediocre forever. One Saturday morning, Jessica had a complete breakdown at our kitchen table. She was crying over her laptop, looking at our bank account. We were down to $400, and our mortgage was due in three days. All the money we'd saved for a down payment on a bigger house was gone. Our emergency fund was empty. Jessica looked at me with tears streaming down her face and said she'd made a terrible mistake. I thought she meant the network marketing thing, but then she brought up that phone call. Said she'd been so focused on wanting a different life that she destroyed the good one we actually had. I told her I heard what she said to Amanda that day. About unsettling, about wanting more. Jessica's face went white. She tried to apologize, but I was honestly too tired to be angry anymore. I just asked her what she wanted to do now. She Said she wanted to fix things if I let her. Jessica got her old job back at the dental office. Took them two months, but they rehired her. She sold all that inventory at a garage sale for pennies on the dollar. We spent the next year digging ourselves out of debt, living on rice and beans. No vacations, no eating out, nothing extra. The kicker, though, her friend Amanda, the one she was always jealous of, got divorced last spring. Turns out all those vacation photos were funded by maxed out credit cards. Amanda's husband had been hiding their debt for years. They lost their house in the divorce. Meanwhile, Jessica's ex, Chris, the one with all the investment properties, got sued by his tenants for unsafe living conditions and lost two of his buildings. Just Jessica saw it on the news. We're doing okay now. Not rich, but stable. Jessica tells people she's grateful for her boring teacher husband who kept us from losing everything. I'm still not sure I've completely forgiven her for what she said. But I know she regrets more than just settling. She regrets almost throwing away something real for something that was never going to make her happy anyway.

Later, Karma hit her really hard. I was working from home when I heard my wife Jessica on the phone in the kitchen. I had my headphones on during a meeting, but my laptop died, and I went to grab the charger from the other room. That. That's when I heard her voice through the wall. She was talking to her friend Amanda, and I could tell from her tone. It was one of those deep conversation calls. I wasn't trying to eavesdrop, but then I heard my name. She said, I love David, but sometimes I wonder what my life would be like if I hadn't settled. I froze in the hallway. Amanda must have asked what she meant, because Jessica continued, like, he the good guy and everything, but he's a teacher. We're never going to be rich. Meanwhile, my ex boyfriend Chris, just bought his third investment property. My stomach dropped. I stood there like an idiot, listening to my wife of seven years tell her friend she regretted marrying me. She kept going. Amanda's always posting pictures from her vacations, and I'm over here clipping coupons. David's happy with his little life, but I wanted more. You know, I wanted the nice house and the fancy dinners and the lifestyle. I walked back to my office and sat there staring at the wall. That night at dinner, Jessica acted completely normal, asking about my day. Talking about her co workers, laughing at some TV show. The whole time, I kept hearing those words in my head. Settled little life. I didn't confront her because, honestly, what was I supposed to say? Two weeks later, Jessica came home excited about some network marketing opportunity. Her friend Tanya had recruited her to sell these wellness products. Jessica said, we can make six figures in our first year. She showed me spreadsheets and income projections. I had a bad feeling immediately, but she was so pumped up about it that I didn't want to crush her. Spent $3,000 on inventory that first month. Boxes of vitamins and shakes filled our garage. Jessica quit her job as a dental hygienist to focus on her business full time. She said she was finally going to build the life she deserved. I kept teaching and covering all our

He is my best friend, but I realized I was never his best friend. I've known Gary since sophomore year. We've been tight ever since. When my ex cheated on me two years ago and broke up with me, I completely fell apart. I stopped going out, stopped caring about anything, just stayed in my room playing video games for hours and honestly doing nothing productive. Gary saw what was happening and literally saved me. He bought me a gym membership with his own money, deleted every single distraction from my laptop and even drove me to therapy appointments every week for 3 months. When I was applying for jobs last year, he stayed up until 2 in the morning helping me practice interview questions. I have my current job because of him. Everyone wants to be around Gary. He's smart, always cracking jokes, always smiling. People at work, people from college, even random people at parties, they all gravitate toward him. Our whole friend group goes to him for advice. I've gone to him dozens of times. I've cried in front of him about my ex, about my mom being sick, about feeling lost. He always listens, always knows what to say. Yesterday, we were just hanging out at the park near his apartment. Nothing special, just sitting on a bench eating burgers from that food truck he likes. We were laughing about something stupid from work. Then suddenly he just Stopped talking. His whole face changed. He started crying, not like quiet tears, full on sobbing. Then he started hitting his own head with his hands, like actually hitting himself hard. I grabbed his arms and tried to hold him still.

A few nights ago, she cornered me while I was eating and said she hated our setup. She wanted me to start eating with her and the kids and split cooking duties with her. She kept saying we were a family and family should eat together. I told her we weren't a family and I didn't want to change anything. Then she brought up the baby and tried to use them as a reason for me to give it a shot. she genuinely thought I wanted a relationship with this random baby. Told her I didn't care about the baby at all. She wouldn't drop it, so I had to rush through my food and went up to my room. But she actually followed me upstairs and kept pushing the family dinner thing. Ever since that night, she brings it up constantly and tells me she's not happy I won't try. I think she went to my dad to get him to talk to me about it, but he told her to leave it alone because I'm not part of the family they're making. Even that didn't stop her, though. Last night, she was waiting for me when I got home at 5. She. I had this whole speech prepared about how it would mean so much to her kids if I ate with them, how the baby deserves to know their brother. I'm not anyone's brother. I told her that, and she actually started crying. She said She was just trying to make a real home for everyone, and I was making it impossible. I asked her why she even cared since she didn't know the first thing about me. She paused and then asked how old I was. I told her I'm 17. Her face went white because she thought I was already 19 or 20. She'd been living in the same house as me for a year and a half and didn't even know my age. That's when I finally lost it. I told her to stop pretending she cared about me or wanted me around. This was all about her wanting to play happy family, and I wasn't interested in being part of her fantasy. He left crying, and I heard her on the phone with someone later saying I was cold and mean. My dad hasn't said anything to me about it, which means he's staying out of it, like we agreed. But now she won't even look at me when I'm in the kitchen, and her kids stare at me like I'm some kind of monster.

I'm 17 and I only have my dad. My mom isn't around, and I don't have any other family I can live with. My relationship with my dad has always been non existent. He resented being stuck raising me alone and never wanted to be a father. When I was younger, I wanted us to be close so badly, but he made it clear he didn't want me as his kid. We don't even call each other dad and son. We use first names. A few years ago, we made this agreement that works for both of us. I don't bother him or ask him for anything, and he doesn't expect me to do chores or be part of his life. I buy and cook my own food, clean up after myself, and basically just sleep there. I moved into the guest room so I could have my own bathroom and privacy. Nobody goes near my room or my stuff. I used to babysit to make money for food and everything else I needed. The arrangement has worked perfectly for three years now. Then, about 18 months ago, my dad's girlfriend moved in with her three kids. They got married pretty fast and had a baby together. I wasn't invited to the wedding, and I don't know anything about her kids. Not their names, not their ages, nothing. I leave every Morning at 7 and come back around 5 to cook and eat my dinner alone in the kitchen. Then I leave again and come home around 8 and in my room. Usually I'm at my friend's house or the library doing homework. My dad doesn't get home until 7:30 or 8 most nights, so I never see him. His wife and her kids eat dinner earlier and she does all the cooking for them. I figured she didn't know about our agreement because she started coming home earlier and asking me weird questions like why was I eating alone and wouldn't I rather eat with everyone else?

My ex husband stood at my door at 2:00am sobbing uncontrollably about how his mistress had betrayed him. The same man who'd laughed when I cried about our marriage ending wanted my sympathy now. Eight months ago, my husband Trevor left me for his 26 year old yoga instructor, Jack Jasmine. We've been married 12 years, built a successful catering business. I discovered their affair through our iPad when her intimate photos synced during dinner. When confronted, Trevor blamed me, said I'd let myself go after our twins were born, that Jasmine made him feel alive and understood his need for adventure. He filed for divorce immediately, demanding I buy out his business, half or sell everything. Fought for fifty fifty custody just to reduce child support. Posted photos with Jasmine at the Maldives resort. While I was getting served divorce papers, my nine year old twins kept asking why daddy's new friend wore mommy's jewelry on Instagram. He'd been gifting her pieces from my grandmother's collection he'd claimed were lost during our move. The divorce was brutal. Trevor hired the most aggressive lawyer in town, claiming I'd been emotionally abusive by controlling his friendships. He got the house since it was his inheritance property, though I'd spent three years renovating it. I moved into a townhouse with the kids, kept the catering business running solo. While he collected monthly buyout payments, Jasmine immediately moved in, redecorated everything, and started a lifestyle blog about creating your dream space with your soulmate. She actually tagged me, thanking me for letting Trevor find true happiness. For months, I focused on rebuilding, doubled my catering contracts, started teaching cooking classes, even went on a few dates. Then last Tuesday, someone's pounding my door at 2:00am. Through the doorbell camera, I see Trevor absolutely wrecked, tears streaming. Against better judgment, I opened with the chain on. He immediately launched into his pathetic story. Jasmine had been cheating for four months with her Crossfit trainer, Antonio. But here's the beautiful part. She'd been using Trevor's money to fund Antonio's new gym and told Antonio that Trevor was just her sugar daddy, too.

I felt like I was going to throw up. What do you mean talk? They made a deal, Jeff said quietly. Remember the business trip Leo went on in August? Well, Leo's still there. He never came back. It was all a boy for Herbert to enter your life. You picked up Herbert from the airport that day and have been with him ever since. The room was spin. After that trip, my boyfriend had been different. He became less confident, quieter. He'd forgotten our inside jokes. His kiss was different. The way he touched me was completely different. Like he was trying to figure out what I liked from scratch. I thought he was just acting weird because he was stressed from work, I whispered. Well, you were wrong. He was acting differently because it was a completely different person. Jess said. Herbert was learning how to be your boyfriend, learning what you liked, trying to copy Leo's personality, but failing because he's now truly shy and anxious. For two and a/2 years, my voice cracked. I've been with a different person for two and a/2 years and no one told me. We thought you knew. Just said miserably. They're twins. We assumed you figured it out and we're okay with it. maybe you preferred Herbert's personality once you got to know him. Their friends all know. Just added. Their parents know. Everyone at their gym knows Leo thinks it's hilarious. He brags about how his brother Herbert got his sloppy seconds and you couldn't even tell. I stood up again, grabbing the table because it felt like the world was crumbling around me. I fell in love with Leo. I was in love with Leo. But you've been sleeping with Herbert, Jess said quietly. You've been engaged to her, Herbert. Tomorrow you're marrying Herbert. My phone rang. It was Herbert. I answered on the fifth ring and he spoke first. Hey, babe, how's the party? His voice was warm, a little drunk. In the background, I heard someone jokingly shout, tell her Leo loves her. And a bunch of guys laughing. I hung up without saying anything. The truth was suffocating me. Every moment for the past two and a half years had been a lie. It was with the wrong twin, the boring twin who needed his brother's personality to get me. I left the party and went straight to Instagram. I found their family page and messaged their dad, their really hot dad who'd always stared at me at family reunions. I messaged him, are you free tonight? Long story short, we spent the night together and their dad, Gerbert, was better than both twins combined. No cap.

He had a little sister named Fenn who was my best friend. I wanted to tell him. My gut instinct told me what Natasha was doing was bad, but I was terrified. Terrified I'd lose my family over a guitar string. Then Fenn texted me, O m. G, Alexander is flying back this weekend to surprise Natasha. He wants you to help. We're picking him up from the airport Saturday and surprising her together. My hands started shaking. Saturday, that was the day Natasha told me Baylor was coming again. I texted back, hey, but I felt like I was going to throw up all week. I couldn't sleep. Saturday came. Natasha reminded me that morning, Baylor's coming at 2. Don't tell anyone. At noon, Ben and I picked up Alexander from the airport, got in the car grinning. I can't wait to see her face. She has no idea. I was sitting in the back seat, my hands and fists. Alexander kept talking. I missed her so much. I've been thinking about this for weeks. I couldn't breathe. Alexander glanced in the rearview mirror. You okay? Back there. I started crying. I couldn't, can't hold it anymore. I have to tell you something. Alexander pulled over. I told him everything. The guitar, the blackmail, Baylor coming over multiple times today. The car was silent. Alexander's hands were gripping the steering wheel. His voice was quiet. My best friend Ben was staring at me, then at her brother. Are You. Her voice was small. Are you going to fly back home? Alexander's face suddenly changed. Fly back? Hell no. He looked at both of us, confronting them. Right now, you two want to join me? We squealed. Our first stop was a party store. Alexander walked straight to the costume section, grabbed two clown masks. If they want to act like clowns, let's make it official. Then found confetti cannons. I grabbed party streamers that said congratulations. We drove to my house. I unlocked the front door. We walked upstairs in complete silence. I could hear voices in Natasha's room. Alexander didn't knock. He kicked the door open, blasted an airhorn. Natasha and Baylor jumped apart. We were standing there, three people dressed for a Celebration. Surprise, babe. Natasha's face went white. Alexander, how did you. Baylor was frozen. Dude, I can explain. Alexander walked up to Natasha, put the clown mask on her head. Since you want to act like a clown, Ben put her mask on. Baylor, I shot the confetti cannon. Congratulations on being terrible people. Confetti everywhere. Natasha ripped the mask off screaming. She pointed at me. You told them? Yeah, I did. I'm telling dad about the guitar. Alexander stepped between us. You've been blackmailing an 11 year old. She opened her mouth but nothing came out. Her face went red. Embarrassed, she looked at me and out of nowhere lunged. But Alexander blocked her. Touch her and we'll press charges. Baylor tried to Leave, but Fenn blocked the door. You're staying for this? We made them stay while Alexander recorded a video of them trying to hide under the sheets. Everyone cut them off. I eventually told dad about the guitar. He laughed. I was going to replace those anyway.

In the end, she realised she was only manipulating herself. When I was 11, I picked up my dad's guitar and strummed the strings. It sounded cool, but I wanted it louder. So I strummed again really hard. This time the thinnest string snapped and hit my face. My stomach dropped. I stared at the broken string hanging limp, holding my my cheek. I started tearing up. That's when my 17 year old sister Natasha appeared in the doorway. Oh my god. Her voice was sharp. You broke Dad's guitar. I didn't mean to. He's going to freak out. She stepped closer. You know how he is about his guitar. He'll disown. Tears filled my eyes. I'm sorry. He's going to send you to the bad children home, she interrupted. You won't see us ever again. I started crying. That's when her face changed. But I won't tell him. My eyes lit up. Thank you. Thank you. Best sis. You're the best. She hugged me. But you have to do something for me in return. I pulled back. Anything. She smiled. Perfect. Someone's going to be coming to our house in an hour. Promise you won't tell anyone who? I was confused. Who's coming over doesn't matter. Do you promise or not? My heart was pounding. I promise. She smiled. Good girl. An hour later, there was a knock at the door. I opened it. Taylor was standing there. My sister's Boyfriend's best friend. Hey, he looked past me. Is Natasha here? I let him in. My stomach felt weird. They went upstairs to her room. I sat on the couch trying to understand why Alexander's best friend was here, why Natasha didn't want me to tell him. An hour later, they came down. Her hair was ruffled. Baylor left without saying much. I found Natasha in the kitchen. Why was Baylor here? She was getting water. What do you mean? Does Alexander know? Of course he knows. It's fine. But it didn't feel fine. Then why did you tell me not to tell anyone if Alexander knows? She turned to face me. Because mom and dad don't like people over when they're not home, so don't say anything to anyone. I wanted to ask more questions, but she was looking at me hard. Remember the guitar? I gulped and nodded. Baylor came over three more times over the next month. Each time, Natasha blackmailed me. I felt sick every time, especially because Alexander was perfect. He visit our family. He was nice to me. Asked about school, treated Natasha like she was the only girl in the.

Everyone was looking at each other with these panicked expressions, like they knew something I didn't. You mean Leo and Herbert, my maid of honor, Jess said slowly. Your fiance and his identical twin brother. My stomach dropped. Who the hell is Herbert? Leo doesn't have any siblings. My sister grabbed Jess's arm and whispered for her to shut up, but I was already waiting for answers. Someone better explain what's going going on right now. They all kept looking at each other, trying to figure out who should talk. Finally, my friend sighed. Jess, just tell her everything, since you already started the explanation. Jess took a huge drink of her wine first. Okay, so in spring 2021, during a rooftop party, you met a guy there, right? Yeah, I met Leo, my fiance. I said, no, that wasn't Leo. It was Leo. Identical twin brother, Herbert. A twin that you never knew about? My legs felt so weak with shock that I had to sit back down. That's impossible! My husband is an only child. Just listen, Jessa. The guy you met at that party was Herbert's twin brother, Leo. Leo was the confident one, the Charming one. My hands were shaking. Now you're telling me that wasn't Herbert? Herbert is the shy twin, Jess continued. But from the moment Leo brought you around, Herbert was obsessed with you. He'd watch you guys from a distance, just waiting for you to break up so he could swoop in and be with you instead. This is insane, I said. But they kept going. By August 2,021, Leo was done with you. Just said. It's what he does. He dates girls for a few months until he gets bored, then ghost them. He was already talking to some girl from his

He said his mom was just anxious about the baby and trying to help. He asked me to give her a break, so I did. The next morning, I woke up to voices downstairs. Diane was on the phone talking to someone. I heard her say my name, so I stopped on the stairs to listen. She was telling whoever it was that I wasn't eating enough and the baby was measuring small, both lies. She said Greg was worried about me but didn't know how to say it, also a lie. Then she said maybe they should consider taking the baby after it was born because I clearly wasn't stable enough to be a mother. She said my anxiety medication proved I had mental problems. I walked down and asked who she was talking to. She hung up fast and said it was her sister. I asked why she was lying about me. She said she wasn't lying and that I was being paranoid. I told her to get out of my house. She refused and she promised Greg she'd take care of me and she wasn't leaving. I called Greg at work and told him what happened. He came home early. Diane told him I was being hormonal and irrational. She actually used those words. Greg asked what the phone call was about. She said I was making it up. I grabbed her phone off the counter and opened her recent Calls. The last one was to Child Protective Services. I just stared at the screen. She'd actually called CPS on me while living in my house. Greg lost it, started yelling at her, asking what she was thinking. Diane said she was protecting her grandchild from an unfit mother. She brought up the medication again and said I'd been acting erratic. Greg told her to pack her stuff and leave. She tried arguing, but he wasn't hearing it. She packed up crying and saying we'd regret this. She was only trying to help. She left and I just sat there shaking. Two days later, a CPS worker showed up. Someone had filed a report claiming I was abusing drugs and planning to neglect the baby. They interviewed me and Greg checked the house, looked at my medical records. The whole thing was humiliating. The worker figured out pretty quick it was bogus and closed the case. But it's on file now forever.

This is the most perverted weapon in the prison. The person who is splashed is disfigured on the spot. Some inmates can't stand the horror of the prison and start to cut a wound on their own bodies in order to calm their panic stricken hearts. Mark, who is on his first day in prison, is so nervous and overwhelmed by the sight that he comforts his roommate while pushing the alarm in the room with all his might. Soon a few police wearing helmets holding Shields rushed in and dragged his panic stricken roommate away by force. Mark was shocked to see this scene, but after two days his roommate didn't come back and Jack from the opposite cell suddenly barged in and took away his roommate's bag of sugar. The righteous Mark fought for his roommate, reminding Jack that he shouldn't have taken other people's things without saying hello, which made him angry with Jack. So you want me your cards marked? And Jack took the sugar, not to eat, but all poured into the boiling kettle. Then Jack picked up the boiling hot sugar water out the door, splashing him in the face of the next door enemy. Mark realized that he had provoked a ruthless man. The next meal, Jack directly grabbed his chicken. The first time Mark did not say anything. When Mark was In line to make a phone call, Jack suddenly snatched the phone. He took up not just the roster, but the limited airtime for each inmate. And seeing that the people around him were watching coldly, Mark had to take the initiative to grab the phone. Give me the phone or I'll snap you! Mark didn't want to make a big deal out of it and put up with it this time. The next day, when Mark called his son, Jack once again grabbed his phone. Hey, give me back! Give me that back! This time, Mark just couldn't take it anymore, and he kept yelling in Jack's ear so that he couldn't talk to his family properly. He didn't expect Jack to hit him directly. Mark's nose was instantly bloody. All this was watched by Sean, the black boss next to him, who wondered why Mark never resisted. I'm a teacher. Because he is a teacher, he should be a civilized example. But Jack saw him as a good bully and started to provoke him when he moved, spitting in Mark's dinner plate and calling Mark a punk. But on this very day, Mark's turnaround came.

She got really mad, started yelling at him about how he knows she doesn't consume animal products, how it's not just a preference but something she cares about. He kept saying it was just a joke and she was overreacting. That's why he asked me to meet him outside instead of going to the house. She told him she didn't want to see him for the rest of the day. Dad looked at me across the table and said, that's funny, right? Like he wanted me to agree with him, to laugh about it. I just sat there for a second. Then I pulled a face and said, don't think so, dad, because I really couldn't see how it was funny. His whole expression changed. He looked annoyed, maybe even angry. He said people these days can't take a joke anymore, that everyone's too sensitive. Then he said, I'm his son and I'm supposed to side with him, that I shouldn't be judgmental since it was harmless, just milk and coffee, no big deal. I told him it wasn't harmless, though. She's vegan for a reason. He made her consume something she specifically avoids on purpose just to mess with her. He waved his hand like I was being dramatic, said it's not like she's allergic, it's just a choice. I said, yeah, it's her choice. And he ignored it to Prank her. He got quiet after that, finished his coffee without looking at me. Then he said, I've changed that I used to laugh at his jokes when I was younger. I told him I was a kid then I didn't really get that his pranks upset people. Now I'm older and I can see when something's mean instead of funny. He didn't like that answer. We left the cafe 20 minutes later, dropped me off at Mom's house early. Didn't even come inside. Just said, see you next week and drove off. When I got inside, mom asked why I was back so soon. I told her what happened. She shook her head and said, your dad never grew up. Some people think pranks are a personality trait instead of just being annoying.

My grandfather wasn't just Westfield High's principal, he was its beating heart. He'd show up to Spirit Week in full costume, lose his voice at Pep rallies and turn senior pranks into legendary battles he somehow always won. The man literally orchestrated a midnight operation to relocate every senior desk onto the football field after they flipped his office upside down. But when we lost grandma last spring, we lost him too. He'd become the complete opposite. No more costumes, no more jokes, and definitely no more pranks. When my classmates started buzzing about senior prank ideas in March, he shut it down immediately over the morning announcements. There will be no senior prank this year. Any student caught attempting one will not walk at graduation. This is non negotiable. Everyone kept coming up to me in the hallways. Josh, you have to talk to him. Come on, you're his grandson. He'll listen to you. But I already tried. Every Sunday dinner at his empty house, I'd watch him push food around his plate in that too quiet kitchen where grandma used to hum while cooking. He'd just grunt when I mentioned school traditions. Rules are rules, Josh, even for you. My friends were relentless, though. During lunch, everyone kept begging me to come up with something. That's when I remembered this hilarious TikTok I'd seen where an entire senior class snuck into their principal's house. For a sleepover, just camping out in sleeping bags until he woke up. It was wholesome, harmless, and honestly, kind of sweet. I looked around the table, guys, what if we all broke into his house for a sleepover? The planning was intricate, but everyone was committed to pulling this off perfectly. I still had a spare key from when I used to stay over as a kid. And I knew my grandfather's routine by heart. He always took his hearing aid out at night and slept like a rock until his 6 a. M. Alarm. We wouldn't damage anything or steal anything. We'd just be 80 seniors with sleeping bags having the world's quietest slumber party in his living room and kitchen. I knew every creek in that house, every security light, even which windows he never locked. Midnight on April 30th, I LED the entire senior class through his backyard. We moved like ninjas, carrying sleeping bags and pillows, suppressing giggles as we filed through the back door. Everyone was so careful and respectful. We laid out our sleeping bags in perfect rows, took selfies, giving.

I think I should let Katie explain. But really, congratulations. You're being very mature about this. He walked away fast. My mom looked at me. What was that about? I have no idea. I pulled out my phone and called Katie straight to voicemail. Texted, what is your dad talking about? No response. Evan, what's going on, mom? I seriously don't know. That night my phone rang. Katie's mom, hi, Missus Barry, Evan, honey, I just wanted to say how mature you're being about all this. My head was spinning. About what long pause? Katie hasn't talked. To you yet. Talk to me about what I think you two need to have a conversation. I'll have her call you. She hung up. I tried Katie again. Voicemail. I texted, your mom just called. What is going on? No response. My phone wouldn't stop buzzing. Katie's mom, Katie's dad, my own parents asking questions I could answer. By Monday morning, I was losing my mind. My mom came into my room. Katie's mother just called me. What did she say? She said you and Katie made a very important decision together that we should be proud of how you're handling it. Evan, what decision, mom? I swear, I don't know. Is Katie okay? I don't know. She won't answer her phone. That night, Doug showed up at my door. Bro, my mom just told me about you and Katie. That's crazy. You good? I pulled him inside. What did your mom tell you? Just that you guys are dealing with some serious stuff. She wouldn't give details, but he looked uncomfortable. You sure this is what you want, Doug? I have no idea what anyone is talking about. His eyes widened. Wait, you seriously don't know? No, dude, you need to find Katie. This sounds big. The next morning, I went to Katie's house before school, knocked on the door. Katie's mom answered. Her eyes were red. Evan, she doesn't want to see you right now. Why not? What's happening? She's going through a lot. Give her some Space, Missus, Barry, please. Nobody will tell me what's going on. She looked at me for a long moment. You really don't know? No.

She picked the wrong man. My fiance and I exchanged glances. I replied, perfect and got security to kick her out. The same night she texted, don't forget the mortgage payment and the Tesla car loan payments are tomorrow. I stared at that text until my hands stopped shaking. On read over my shoulder, what mortgage? What Tesla? That's when six years of lies came pouring out. When I was 22, my mother called crying, dad made bad investments. They'd lose the house. Could I help just temporarily? I co signed a 60 thousand dollar mortgage refinance. Six months later, I co signed a 55 thousand dollar Tesla loan. Because he deserves something nice. I promised to make every payment. I'd never see a Bill except the backup. Automatic transfers from my account became the primary. $700 monthly for the mortgage, $800 for the Tesla, plus insurance, taxes, emergencies, nearly $2,000 vanishing every month for six years. $150,000 of my money gone. I've been packing lunches and skipping trips thinking I was saving for our wedding. But I was barely breaking even, drowning while my mother pushed me under inch by inch. When I felt stressed about money, she'd say, you make good money, you're just bad with budgeting. She gaslit me into thinking I was the problem. John asked what I wanted to do. I logged into my bank and deleted every Automatic payment authorization. Then I screenshot the confirmation and sent it to my mother with one message. You said you weren't paying for the circus. I'm not paying for your life anymore. I blocked her number, turned off my phone, let John hold me while I shook apart. The next morning brought 17 missed calls on John's phone. My mother's friends, my aunts, cousins, the family network activated with one message. I was selfish, ungrateful, destroying my family over one little disagreement. She'd recruited everyone to tell me so. Then my mother's lawyer sent a letter threatening to sue me for emotional distress and financial damage caused by my unwarranted withdrawal of support. She was threatening legal action for stopping payments on debts that were legally theirs. I hired a lawyer. Jennifer reviewed everything and smiled with steel in her eyes. Your mother doesn't have a case. If she pursues this, we'll counter sue for financial abuse. We'll expose every transfer, every guilt trip, every manipulative text. We'll make this so ugly she'll wish she never picked up the phone. Two weeks before the wedding, the mortgage payment bounced. My credit dropped 30 points. The Tesla payment bounced. Next day, another hit. Then Jennifer discovered something. My mother had been making minimum payments with my money while telling relatives.

My sister burst out laughing. I said nothing. That night, dad texted, don't bring that boy around us again. I replied, perfect. I'll pull my name off every Bill tonight. Ten minutes later, the family group chat went nuclear. My name is Dylan. I'm 38. For most of my adult life, I've been my family's invisible ATM. My son Andrew is 7. His mother died when he was 2. Since then, it's been us dad. I'd always loved my sister Haley more. Her college was paid in full while I worked nights. Her wedding had ice sculptures while mine had folding chairs. Her kids get birthday checks with three figures. Andrew gets cards that arrive late. The family home looks newer because I paid for the roof replacement when Dad's insurance lapsed, paid for the HVAC upgrade, the kitchen remodel when Haley decided Mom's countertops were too embarrassing for Instagram. At the last family dinner, Haley's youngest spilled juice and mom laughed it off. Andrew knocked over an empty bowl and dad made him apologize four times. Christmas dinner started the way it always did, too much noise, too little space for Andrew. The prime rib I bought sat center stage, $200 for people who barely acknowledged my son. Andrew asked quietly for mashed potatoes. Haley's oldest son, Henry put a massive spoonful and plopped it onto Andrew's shirt. Andrew froze. Henry Grinned. Clean it yourself, baby. Haley laughed, a full delighted laugh. Oh, my God, Henry, you're terrible. She didn't apologize. She just kept laughing. I cleaned him up. Nobody asked if he was okay. Andrew whispered, dad, can we go home? We stayed another hour. Andrew didn't eat when we left. I buckled Andrew in. He stared out the window with his thumb in his mouth. Seven years old and already learning some people don't love you the way they should. My phone buzzed at 9:47 p. M. Dad's text, don't bring that boy around us again. He makes everyone uncomfortable. That boy, not Andrew, that boy. Something inside me went cold. I opened the spreadsheet I've been maintaining for five years. Mortgage assistance, $18,000 dollars. Insurance, $4,200 annually. Car repair, $3,800. Haley's credit card debt, $6,500. Medical bills, $2,900. Kitchen remodel, $22,000. $140,000, money that could have been Andrew's college fund. I opened the family group chat. Perfect. I'll pull my name off every Bill tonight. The house, the cars, the accounts, all of it. Merry Christmas. I hit send, then turned off my phone. At 802:00am, the emails sent.

Now, your counter argument is like, look, dude, it's 5,000 guys. It's not that big of a deal. True. But it sends a signal that we better be serious about cutting in every department, including the Pentagon. By the way, we should cut the defense budget as well because our nation is careening towards bankruptcy. So I just want you to understand from our perspective that nobody should be necessarily off limits from getting us towards a balanced budget. I do understand that. But I think that it also sends a message that we as a country or at least the government doesn't support that sector as a part of stuff that it, the government should like enforce. Fair enough. That's a good point. Thank you. Yeah. Any other questions? You're, I do. Yeah, really. So, um, I just, I'm curious what, uh, who you think Elon Musk has in his best interest. Uh, you really, you wanna live in a country that has a balanced budget and the US dollar reigns supreme. So let's look at the incentive structure. Why would the world's wealthiest man go do this? I want you to tell me what you think. And I'll tell you what I think. I think it's because he is trying to get money for Spacex and he has proposed internally, uh, bills to, to get money for his corporation. So That he can. So let's pause. So, so far his net worth has gone down like $100 billion. So if his goal is to get wealthy, he's not doing great. But he's asking our government for more money for space. Well, he's asking for contracts to go do necessary things for the space fight. Now, I'm, I totally agree that there should probably be an independent review board. He's very close to the president. We got to be close to make sure there's no corruption there. I totally agree, even though I know both Elon and the president. Okay. I, respectfully, I'm gonna disagree. I do wanna ask though, um, what is your opinion on, uh, trying to get rid of the two party system in America? Because personally, I think that it as a system divides us more than anything. I'm, I'm all for it. Democrats should abolish their party first and then we'll go next. Interesting. I, I mean, yes. Look, here's the problem. You're talking about the issue of permanency of factions. George Washington wrote about this extensively. Federalist Papers. Yeah. Yeah. The issue is just eventually in a national system, you're gonna be organized into two political parties. Was it not Madison that said that? Yeah. No, Madison and Washington. Washington warned, warned about two things, permanent political parties and permanent alliances. Those are his two big warnings. Okay. I, I wanna get some other questions though. Okay. Uh, thank you.

Okay. So I, I'm glad to be an American. I'm glad to live in this country either as far as I know, there's no better country. Um, and, and part of that is that we don't, we don't prosecute people for things they did before it was illegal. Now, my question is, well, first off, I'll state, um, the law is to first off inform people. Secondly, um, persuade them. Um, um, uh, and thirdly to, to, you're gonna talk about pro life laws and potentially criminalizing women that get abortions. Right. Right. And my question, no, I, I, I'm, I'm 10 steps ahead of you. Got it. So let me tell you my position cause we only have so much time. Right? My, my question for you is why are you against abolition? Okay. No, so actually I am for the abolition of abortion. But let me tell you why I personally say if an abortion law was passed, I don't think it would a, be the right thing under the current way that abortion is practiced in America to say that if a woman gets an abortion, she should then go to jail. Let me tell you why it's, cause the way abortion is practiced in this country, women are not given informed consent. They do not know a lot of times what they are doing when they get an abortion. Now that it's a very important distinction in Order to criminalize somebody, you need in the criminal statute, not the civil statute, you need intent. Right. Great. Right. So, and the law would cover that. Yes. So this is a, I think, a largely unhelpful, very far distant hypothetical that does a couple things. Not only do I disagree with it, but individuals like yourself are going around saying that we should put women in prison if they get abortions. There's, there's nothing that says what the punishment. Okay. But however, let me just pause and say, how about first, can we at least agree the people doing the abortions, like the abortionist, they should go to federal prison for the rest of their life. We can agree on that. And so I don't want to spend too much time on this. My perspective is very simple that if you do not have informed consent, then I have a very hard time using the criminal code to go after an individual. Our justice system doesn't work like that. If, if, if there was not intent, then the justice system says you weren't a criminal. Okay. Then, then we agree. Then, then therefore, it shouldn't go after those individuals. If you can't prove intent, then it should not go after those individuals. Thank you so much for your time. I gotta get to the next question. Thank you. We should have laws against it.

Even on cliff edges, he doesn't forget to drive on the right side. Morning. Good. And talk. After arriving home safely, everyone's tense nerves instantly relax. It's only then that Homer remembers Maggie is still in the car. However, a child alone in the car is extremely dangerous, especially with a cake. Marge hurriedly asks everyone to find the spare key. Okay, the spare key is somewhere in here. If progress goes well, they should be able to find it in two hours. Just then, Maggie appears with the key. Hello! Faced with so many keys, Lisa is quite puzzled. Homer explains that if you live long enough, you can accumulate many things. By maintaining this habit, you can amass unimaginable wealth. Marge thinks they should return the keys one by one, but Bart and Homer don't agree. Homer, stop him! Stop who, Marge? Be specific. Bart takes a set of spare keys and prepares to start pranking. First, he opens the federal post office mailbox. Oh, thank god! I can get back the angry letter I wrote to my boss! Bart didn't expect his bad intentions would result in a good deed. Unwilling to accept defeat, he continues his mischief. He activates a high rise elevator platform, planning to give everyone a but performance. Just then, an old man preparing to jump off the building falls onto his elevator platform. You're my naked fairy god, boy! Oh, jeez, I hope no one heard you say that. For this, the mayor even awards him an honorary key. But he has one request. And lower your pants for the picture. No! Meanwhile, Homer takes the brewery Key, planning to have a blast with Barney. The two sneak into the factory and find the advertising blimp of their dreams. Oh, how I'd love to drive that thing! Seeing the blimp enthusiastically inviting him, Homer can't wait to take off his clothes and run aboard. This move instantly bewilders Barney. When we see each other again, you'll be an old man. Be a baby! During the flight, Homer is amazed to discover the refrigerator is full of beer. But he doesn't know if drinking while piloting a blimp counts as drunk driving. Cleverly, he takes out his phone to text for help. Just like that, the blimp flies through a roller coaster, airplane routes and tunnels. What was that? The police quickly noticed the out of control blimp. He hurriedly follows behind, shouting. Ignoring him makes it very dangerous for the birds flying in the sky. Hello, suckers! It's up! All the humanity! Meanwhile, Marge has finished organizing all the keys. Looking at only one key left for a wind up mechanism, she suddenly remembers this is a prank gift Homer gave her. The moment she makes the phone call, the model car quietly slips away. The toy passes by Flanders House and the sound it makes instantly attracts two Children, Jesus Christ! Blood every time you lie. The model car travels all the way to the gastrointestinal support group. The group members feel deeply humiliated at this moment. Marge rushes over to inquire. You mean you're wind up hate crime? Oh! Then it crosses the bridge and drives to Clancy's side. Marge shouts for him to help. Clancy says things on the ground are not within his jurisdiction. A thief, hearing this, discovers the loophole. Really rubbing it in. Ho, ho, ho! Maybe if I use a pen on another front. Lisa takes the school key, preparing to return it to the principal. Nelson, passing by, says this key can open any door in the school. But unfortunately, she's a goody two shoes, living the same life every day. And the day before that, and the day before that. Lisa's curiosity gradually becomes aroused. Unknowingly, she arrives at the school's dilapidated basement. Everything here reveals an eerie atmosphere. But the moment she opens the door, she's instantly shocked. Five illogical classrooms are actually combined together. The pull down maps are empty. The rulers have no markings, and even the tooth model has no enamel. Lisa flees in terror. What is going on? She immediately finds the principal to tell him about this. The principal absolutely refuses to acknowledge it. It's real. They bring student journalist to the basement unexpectedly. When they open the door, there's only a bookshelf. The principal thinks Lisa is too nervous and writing a few Test papers will solve it, but his panicked expression makes Lisa sense something is definitely wrong. Unwilling to give up, she returns to the classroom again. It turns out the bookshelf behind the door was added later. At this moment, she discovers a sneaky shadow. Lisa finds Bart to seek help. They find Nelson, who has been held back the most to understand the situation. At this moment, Homer appears at the school piloting the blimp, but due to his questionable skills, the aircraft nose dives vertically. The next second, who needs so many buttons? Lisa urgently presses the pause button and gets ejected outside the aircraft cabin. At this moment, she suddenly sees school bus 23 at the bottom of the water, which is actually full of students. Seeing this, Homer quickly jumps from the aircraft to rescue Lisa. As a result, he's too fat and gets stuck in the opening. Yes, and I got gum on my shoe! Bart hurriedly grabs a fire extinguisher to rescue him. His heavy body flips the school bus over. All the students on the bus are rescued. Lisa discovers in horror that all the students are dummies. The two are instantly submerged in the water by the dummies. At this moment, Marge's model car crashes into a large tree and the two are rescued. The storylines perfectly converge at this point. I'm sorry, homie. It's worse than you think. I have to buy you a new anniversary present. Lisa still doesn't understand Why there are so many models in the school bus. Everyone comes to the school to question the principal. The principal has no choice but to tell the truth from back then. He put the subsidy allowance in his pocket unexpectedly. His mother accidentally shredded the money while doing laundry. To give an explanation to the relevant authorities, he had to rent some props and take some photos. But unfortunately, funds were limited, so we had the driver return them the same day. But he ultimately didn't account for Homer buying a giant cake and Maggie being locked in the car. We planned for the wedding cake. We just didn't see the baby thing coming. Well, you should have. How could I? She wasn't even born yet. People

The boy's grip slipped and he began to plumb it. Fortunately, he landed on a thick blanket spread out on the neighbor's roof, which broke his fall and saved him. But the danger wasn't over yet. The blanket began to slide off the roof, and he quickly grabbed an antenna below to prevent himself from falling again. Desperately, he tried to wrap his leg around it, but his hands were growing weaker by the second. Looking up, he saw his own window and screamed for help. But his mother was lying unconscious inside. At the sound of his voice, she suddenly woke up, shocked and rushed to the window. She reached out to grab him, but her hand couldn't quite reach. Meanwhile, the screw holding the antenna was coming loose. Without thinking, his mother leaned dangerously out of the window and grabbed her son's hand. But just then, the antenna snapped free and the boy began to slip again. By some miracle, he got caught on a clothes rod sticking out from the wall. His fall once more, he was saved again, but he was still hanging in the air. Just then, his father came. Home with groceries, looked up and saw his son dangling from the building. In shock, he dropped everything and ran inside. The elevator wasn't coming, so he sprinted up the stairs as fast as he could. He finally reached the rooftop in time to save his son.
