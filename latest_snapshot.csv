The only Trump tea I listened to. #entertainment #trump #divorce #cheater #marlamaples #ivanatrump #gossip #90s #scandal #greenscreen ,,"before this man was president he was in the tabloids for this messy divorce and this is the only Trump tea I paid attention to before there was first lady Melania there was Ivana Trump Donald's first wife and their breakup was sloppy oppy they met in 1976 nine months later April 1977 they were married Ivana was ambitious she was a hard worker she was poised and together they built the Trump empire if you will New York and tabloids could not get enough of this couple together they had three children Donald junior Ivanka and Eric they were a power couple and their kids grew up in New York Ivana was a doting wife and she had a major role within the Trump Organization she was in fact VP of Interior Design she liked it gaudy gold everywhere pink marble you get the idea in 1989 they’re in Aspen on a ski trip where a young blonde named Marla Maples skis up to Ivana and says hi I'm Marla I love your husband do you Ivana said she replied get lost I love my husband but this was a huge scene in Aspen it was all over the tabloids and Donald told her you're overreacting a couple of weeks later he attended a New Year's Eve party with his mistress Marla Maples apparently Marla and Donald met in 1984 and they were having an affair and he was putting her up everywhere I guess she was living on one of his yachts at one time this affair and the Aspen incident was all over the tabloids in February Marla was overheard saying he was the best she had ever had that same month he tells Ivana it's just not working out so they file for divorce but Ivana she's contesting the prenup she's like I helped you build your empire it's a battle Donald locks Ivana out of her office it's all over the news it's on tabloids cover of newspapers it was juicy and people could not get enough Ivana even said in court papers that Donald graped her and pulled out chunks of hair which they both later denied they're divorced but everything isn't finalized until 1992 and Ivana receives $14 million a 45 room mansion in Connecticut an apartment in New York a month every year at Mar-a-Lago and I think something like $650,000 a year in child support meanwhile he's living it up with Marla he's kind of stringing her along and they're dating but he breaks up with her via FedEx and then they get back together he's giving interviews where he's bragging about being a player he told Vanity Fair I had been in Europe trucking every model in the world my life was wild 1993 Marla is pregnant and then she gives birth to Tiffany Trump in October Marla is just waiting for Donald to marry her but during this time Donald was going through a lot he was on the verge of bankruptcy his casino was failing so they negotiate a prenup and it's basically like you get $1 million no alimony and you can't talk about it she's getting the short end of the stick but what can she do she wants to marry him she has nothing right but they say you know what let's renegotiate after five years in December 1993 Marla and Donald get married in front of 1,000 guests this picture sends me but guess what the girl fumbled the bag allegedly Marla liked to party when she was in Florida she'd like to go out and then she was caught on the beach at 4:00am with her bodyguard Spencer Wagner the bodyguard's wife said that Marla was really aggressive and always trying to grab on the bodyguard later he oded both Donald and Marla denied the affair but Trump was over it and he wasn't gonna divorce her right away cause he didn't wanna confirm that she was cheating you know his ego after a year they separated a couple of years later they divorced Marla and their daughter Tiffany moved to California in a 2022 deposition he was being questioned about E. Jean Carroll that whole thing and he mistakenly identified E. Jean  Carroll as his wife Marla he showed him this particular picture and he thought Carroll was Marla Maples as for Ivana she did her thing she remarried and even though they had the messiest divorce they got along for their children and in 1995 they did a Pizza Hut commercial together where in it Ivana says may I have the last slice and Donald replies well actually you're only entitled to half in 1996 she made a cameo in the movie First Wives Club where she says don't get mad get everything up until the end Ivana knew how to throw shade she said she would never forgive Marla Maples she never accomplished anything for herself and she said I call her the show girl then she said she had a direct line to the White House but she would never call because Melania was there and she never wanted to make her jealous but she was the first Trump wife and she was actually the first lady Ivana passed away in 2022 she was 73 years old her ex husband and his current wife Melania did attend the funeral and she's buried at Trump's golf club in New Jersey",https://www.tiktok.com/@mesnarky/video/7354485861146266922

An employee who works there who wants to remain anonymous, said it's probably an inside job. No duh. Of course it is. According to the news, they shimmied on down through the ceiling, okay? And they got the money through what may or may not have been a vault. Say what? And all they're showing is this hole, this patched up hole. How many people did it take? How heavy was the money? How big was the getaway truck? How did nobody see it? If you're in LA, you know about the smash and grab robberies, right? Which has caused us great annoyance because now everything is under lock and key and you have to ding dong to wait for someone to come and unlock basic necessities. This was elevated on a holy day.

The woman stuttered and assured Jack that everything was fine and she didn't need any help. However, Jack noticed that one of the wheels of the stroller had completely come off, so he quickly reassured the woman not to worry as he would fix it for her. Jack didn't realize that the woman was very nervous, constantly glancing at Jack and the child in the stroller. Jack thought the young mother might be anxious about accepting help from a stranger. While fixing the wheel, Jack tried to chat with the woman, asking about the baby's well being an age. The woman mumbled unclearly, seeming unable or unwilling to engage in conversation.

Prisoners are sent to a place known as the island of hell, officially called the Black Dolphin prison. Black Dolphin is Russia's highest security prison, housing 200 inmates, considered the nation's most significant threats, including terrorists, Mafia bosses, and serial killers responsible for the blood of nearly 4,000 innocents. Thus, the death penalty is deemed too lenient for them. In this prison, inmates cannot eat together. Guards deliver food through a long stick to a small window in the inmate's cell, consisting only of corsi, brio and leftovers, barely enough to sustain life. Consequently, it's rare to see anyone overweight here. When leaving their cells, inmates must walk bent at a 90 degree angle and are blindfolded when outside. They spend their entire sentences without knowing what the prison looks like, only familiar with their 5 square meter cells. During the day, inmates are not allowed to sit or lie down on their beds, only stand. Lights must stay on at night, and covering the light in any way, including with clothes or arms, even covering the head, is prohibited. They must also remain active before sleeping. Failing to meet activity requirements results in punishment. Inmates have no privacy or human rights, except for the toilet, which is fixed to the floor. The guards are armed with live ammunition matching the number of inmates, ensuring constant 24 hour surveillance for Centuries no inmate has successfully escaped. The only escape is death, making life here more painful than execution. Some inmates even fake escape attempts, hoping to be killed by guards. To prevent suicide, guards confiscate anything that could be used as a tool for suicide. In theory, inmates are released after serving 25 years, but no one has ever left Black Dolphin alive, making the loneliness and despair unbearable for many who would rather die than continue living in such conditions.

And now another young woman is next. This is Shaunty de decords, and with both the support of her doctors and her parents, she has gone through with ending her life. She was 16 and on a school trip when she survived the Brussels Airport bombing. After that, she quote, was never the same. Now, according to Shanti's parents, she found it impossible to enjoy life after the attack, to the point where she was scared of balloons bursting and was suffering panic attacks from fireworks. This is what reportedly LED them to support her decision, with everyone in her life telling her that her disease was incurable. Doctors then, quote, logically granted her request given her state of suffering and on May 7th, the procedure was performed. And to be specific, this is reportedly a process for your given a sedative and then a drug that stops your heart. It's actually legal in five countries across Europe. And again now this young woman is following Chante's lead. 20 eight year old Zariah Beak is from another small town in Germany and like Chante, she is struggling with her mental health. In her case, she lives with her boyfriend and her two cats, but has been dealing with depression and multiple personality disorder for years. Her doctors have also told her that they have no further treatment options, to which she has said, quote, I have always Been clear that if I can't get better, I won't do this anymore. She's reportedly scheduled to be euthanized next month on the couch of she and her boyfriend's home. Now, what we know is the talk of Zari's case is leading to controversy on whether or not this should be legal. There is a review panel to determine if an applecant is eligible, and it's then reportedly their job to examine the death and declare that it was done mawfully. But one former member on that panel has said, quote, I entered the review committee in 2005, and I was there until 2,014. In those years, I saw euthanasia practice evolve from death being a last resort option to being a default option. So I resign. He went on to say that this is especially prevalent in young adults with psychological issues and that doctors are now more easily giving up on their patients. In 2 thousand twenty three, they were hundreds euthanized in Germany, with one of them being shaunty. And while one neurologist did make complaints about the decision being made prematurely, the case was then closed after it was found that no violations were made. And as for Zariah, she's already gotten off of social media ahead of her procedure. She says that things will go something like this. Quote, the doctor really takes her time. It's not that they walk in and say, lay down, please. Most of the time it's first a cup of Coffee to settle the nerves and create a soft atmosphere. Then she asked if I'm ready. I will take my place in the couch. She will once again ask if I am sure, and she will start up the procedure and wish me a good journey. Or in my case, a nice nap. Because I hated people say safe journey. I'm not going anywhere.",https://www.tiktok.com/@gkrw2840xwgcw20480/video/7354680036147989791

The Daily Mail put out this article Gypsy Rose Blanchard's estranged husband Ryan Anderson reveals he was blindsided by their split and had no clue she still had strong feelings for her ex boyfriend. Speaking exclusively to dailymail.com, Ryan Anderson confirms that he and Gypsy have separated over her continued relationship with her ex fiance Ken. He said, I'm not doing well with it. For me it just came out of the blue. I had no idea she still had such strong feelings for him. Special needs teacher Anderson, 37, clutched Pixie, the cute little Shih Tzu pup that he and Blanchard, 32, adopted together, in January, as he told dailymail.com that he was for sure keeping the dog. Barely four months ago, Anderson posted about his perfect life on Instagram when he introduced Pixie to followers in a picture of her with Blanchard and wrote my two favorite girls, my family is adorable. I'm so lucky. Instead, just a day ago on Thursday, pictures emerged of Blanchard hand in hand with Urker, who first started writing to her in 2018 after seeing her HBO documentary Mommy Dead and dearest. They broke up not long before she started the prison romance with Anderson. In 2020, apparently without a care in the world, a beaming Blanchard and Erker were seen visiting a Dollar General store in south Louisiana and casually smoking a cigarette together. They made no effort to hide the matching husky dog tattoos they just got days earlier. For Anderson, it was a cruel and confusing display of their closeness. He told dailymail.com, I haven't spoken to her, so I just don't know what's going on. I'm at a loss.

Oh yeah, did I mention he's a free man walking out in society right now? Let's talk about this. This is Aaron Hutton from New Zealand. In the year 2,014, New Zealand police started tracking an account that went by Kiwi Pedo on the dark web, and the chats that this user was having with undercover police were disturbing. Aaron had responded to an ad that an undercover officer posted offering a Chinese child for sale for $10,000. Aaron reached out and it seemed like he was deadly serious. During his conversations with the undercover officer. Aaron reference Joseph Fritzel, the man who imprisoned his own daughter for 24 years in Austria, repeatedly assaulted her, and even had children with her. Aaron referred to Joseph as his hero. And when the undercover officer asked Aaron if having a random Chinese child in his home would raise any suspicion, Aaron, chatting as Kiwi Pedo, responded, it's called a basement. So eventually Aaron started telling the undercover officer that he would pay up to $15,000 in cash or bitcoin for a child under seven. And soon afterwards, the authorities were able to pinpoint where his chats were coming from, his workplace, and Aaron was then arrested and his workplace and house were searched. Now, investigators actually found 417 CP or CSAM images and videos on Aaron's devices, which in my opinion is enough to be A life sentence. But after all was said and done, after this man tried to purchase a child under seven years old on the dark web, after he was found to be in possession of hundreds of CP and CSAM images and videos, he was sentenced to five years in prison. And to add insult to injury, his five year sentence was thrown out and he was re sentenced to only three years in prison. This happened a few years ago. So that means that he's back out in society right now? Yes, Aaron has already been released. He's already served his full sentence for all of that. And it truly just makes me sick to my stomach that people like this keep getting away with these crimes time and time again. When you're in possession of hundreds of CP or CSAM images, that should be treated as you victimizing hundreds of children. But the government doesn't see it that way for some reason. I don't understand why. And yeah, he's back out.

Now there are certain words I can't say, but you know what messing around really means here. Haley Clifton Carmack, a 26 year old high school math teacher from Missouri has been charged for having a relationship with her 16 year old student. One instance of them fooling around reportedly occurred at the school during the school day while other students were acting as lookouts. The recently divorced teacher and mother of two had previously been worn by the administration for dressing inappropriately.

Sources also say that Gypsy has been telling people that one of the major sticking points in their relationship was Ryan's apparent jealousy over Gypsy spending time with her dad. Gypsy reportedly feels like Ryan made her feel guilty about not spending that time with him exclusively. She reportedly felt suffocated by Ryan's constant guilt tripping. Sources also say that Gypsy's inner circle had concerns about Ryan's intentions, especially since he originally contacted Gypsy on a dare. If you recall, Ryan Anderson wrote a letter to Gypsy Rose Blanchard after he made a bet with his friend, and that's essentially what started their relationship.

The brutal attack was caught on camera and the footage showed a group of five girls chasing the disabled 64 year old down an alley and ripping him off a chain link fence as he desperately tried to flee.

An autopsy later listed his manner of death as blunt force trauma. According to police, brown was disabled and had mental health issues. He also had a metal plate in his head and only two fingers on each hand. Detective Harry Singleton testified that a man in his early 20s initiated the attack by grabbing brown by the collar and throwing him against a brick wall.

This is 29 year old William Mcclish will now spend his life behind bars for assaulting these two officers back in 2021 with the attempt to surprise and kill them. And of course, this happened in Orlando, Florida. He was convicted yesterday, April 3rd, for a number of things. Attempted for degree murder, aggravated assault, battery on an officer, resisting an officer with violence. Just keeps adding up. And on top of that, he was streaming this on Facebook. This happened in September of 2021. He propped his phone up in the trash can and started streaming on North Magnolia and East Washington Street. As soon as the streaming happened, the two officers were in frame. Mcclish decided to slap one of them on the head with a brick. And of course, as the title suggests, he bit one of them and gouged one of the eyes. He also snatched one of the officers radios off of his uniform to prevent him from calling for help. Now, he represented himself during the trial and all he said was, I didn't do it. The evidence was tampered with. However, obviously he streamed this whole thing live, so it wasn't. Kind of incriminated himself with that. Let me know what you guys think about this in the comment section below.
