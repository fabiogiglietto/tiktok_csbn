The only Trump tea I listened to. #entertainment #trump #divorce #cheater #marlamaples #ivanatrump #gossip #90s #scandal #greenscreen ,,"before this man was president he was in the tabloids for this messy divorce and this is the only Trump tea I paid attention to before there was first lady Melania there was Ivana Trump Donald's first wife and their breakup was sloppy oppy they met in 1976 nine months later April 1977 they were married Ivana was ambitious she was a hard worker she was poised and together they built the Trump empire if you will New York and tabloids could not get enough of this couple together they had three children Donald junior Ivanka and Eric they were a power couple and their kids grew up in New York Ivana was a doting wife and she had a major role within the Trump Organization she was in fact VP of Interior Design she liked it gaudy gold everywhere pink marble you get the idea in 1989 they’re in Aspen on a ski trip where a young blonde named Marla Maples skis up to Ivana and says hi I'm Marla I love your husband do you Ivana said she replied get lost I love my husband but this was a huge scene in Aspen it was all over the tabloids and Donald told her you're overreacting a couple of weeks later he attended a New Year's Eve party with his mistress Marla Maples apparently Marla and Donald met in 1984 and they were having an affair and he was putting her up everywhere I guess she was living on one of his yachts at one time this affair and the Aspen incident was all over the tabloids in February Marla was overheard saying he was the best she had ever had that same month he tells Ivana it's just not working out so they file for divorce but Ivana she's contesting the prenup she's like I helped you build your empire it's a battle Donald locks Ivana out of her office it's all over the news it's on tabloids cover of newspapers it was juicy and people could not get enough Ivana even said in court papers that Donald graped her and pulled out chunks of hair which they both later denied they're divorced but everything isn't finalized until 1992 and Ivana receives $14 million a 45 room mansion in Connecticut an apartment in New York a month every year at Mar-a-Lago and I think something like $650,000 a year in child support meanwhile he's living it up with Marla he's kind of stringing her along and they're dating but he breaks up with her via FedEx and then they get back together he's giving interviews where he's bragging about being a player he told Vanity Fair I had been in Europe trucking every model in the world my life was wild 1993 Marla is pregnant and then she gives birth to Tiffany Trump in October Marla is just waiting for Donald to marry her but during this time Donald was going through a lot he was on the verge of bankruptcy his casino was failing so they negotiate a prenup and it's basically like you get $1 million no alimony and you can't talk about it she's getting the short end of the stick but what can she do she wants to marry him she has nothing right but they say you know what let's renegotiate after five years in December 1993 Marla and Donald get married in front of 1,000 guests this picture sends me but guess what the girl fumbled the bag allegedly Marla liked to party when she was in Florida she'd like to go out and then she was caught on the beach at 4:00am with her bodyguard Spencer Wagner the bodyguard's wife said that Marla was really aggressive and always trying to grab on the bodyguard later he oded both Donald and Marla denied the affair but Trump was over it and he wasn't gonna divorce her right away cause he didn't wanna confirm that she was cheating you know his ego after a year they separated a couple of years later they divorced Marla and their daughter Tiffany moved to California in a 2022 deposition he was being questioned about E. Jean Carroll that whole thing and he mistakenly identified E. Jean  Carroll as his wife Marla he showed him this particular picture and he thought Carroll was Marla Maples as for Ivana she did her thing she remarried and even though they had the messiest divorce they got along for their children and in 1995 they did a Pizza Hut commercial together where in it Ivana says may I have the last slice and Donald replies well actually you're only entitled to half in 1996 she made a cameo in the movie First Wives Club where she says don't get mad get everything up until the end Ivana knew how to throw shade she said she would never forgive Marla Maples she never accomplished anything for herself and she said I call her the show girl then she said she had a direct line to the White House but she would never call because Melania was there and she never wanted to make her jealous but she was the first Trump wife and she was actually the first lady Ivana passed away in 2022 she was 73 years old her ex husband and his current wife Melania did attend the funeral and she's buried at Trump's golf club in New Jersey"

Prisoners are sent to a place known as the island of hell, officially called the Black Dolphin prison. Black Dolphin is Russia's highest security prison, housing 200 inmates, considered the nation's most significant threats, including terrorists, Mafia bosses, and serial killers responsible for the blood of nearly 4,000 innocents. Thus, the death penalty is deemed too lenient for them. In this prison, inmates cannot eat together. Guards deliver food through a long stick to a small window in the inmate's cell, consisting only of corsi, brio and leftovers, barely enough to sustain life. Consequently, it's rare to see anyone overweight here. When leaving their cells, inmates must walk bent at a 90 degree angle and are blindfolded when outside. They spend their entire sentences without knowing what the prison looks like, only familiar with their 5 square meter cells. During the day, inmates are not allowed to sit or lie down on their beds, only stand. Lights must stay on at night, and covering the light in any way, including with clothes or arms, even covering the head, is prohibited. They must also remain active before sleeping. Failing to meet activity requirements results in punishment. Inmates have no privacy or human rights, except for the toilet, which is fixed to the floor. The guards are armed with live ammunition matching the number of inmates, ensuring constant 24 hour surveillance for Centuries no inmate has successfully escaped. The only escape is death, making life here more painful than execution. Some inmates even fake escape attempts, hoping to be killed by guards. To prevent suicide, guards confiscate anything that could be used as a tool for suicide.

Logan, who loved his job, was a policeman. One day, quite normally, he stopped a car on the freeway for tinted windows. Little did he know, however, that this encounter would change his life forever. It was supposed to be a routine check, but unfortunately, he had no idea who he was actually going to be checking. So Logan went to meet this BMW with windows he found far too dark for his taste. You're not allowed to tint your windows. Too dark or you'll be fine. He knocked on the driver's window, but the driver wouldn't open it at first. And Logan had no way of knowing who was behind the window because he simply couldn't see the driver. He could have been armed. So the policeman put his hand on his gun and asked the second time, this time with a firmer tone, to open the window. This time, the driver, noticing the stern expression on Logan's face, slowly and cautiously opened the car window, fully aware that Logan, the diligent traffic officer, was just moments away from writing him a parking violation ticket.

And it revealed the secret she was hiding from her husband. Carrie and Bailey had just moved into a new house when they received a call from a friend of Carrie asking him to keep his dog for a few days because he was going on a business trip. But it wasn't just any dog. It was Coco, a gigantic former police dog. But Bailey, who didn't like dogs, showed herself very reluctant. She made up stories, but in the end, she accepted the dog in the house, but didn't know what to expect. At first, everything was calm. Bailey even liked Coco. But Carrie Friend called to say that the trip was unexpected, that Coco had to stay at his place for at least one more month. And that's when things started to go wrong. Indeed, after a while, every time Bailey came home from work, Coco would get mad at her. He sniffed her, jumped on her, and even sometimes grunted. But it was in a very weird and obsessive way. Different from the one where the dog is happy to find its owner. Carrie then started to think that Coco was doing this because there was a dog smell on his wife. And that Coco was very excited about it. But at the same time, he started to link the dots. Because Bailey couldn't find a dog from work to home. And even if she found one from Time to time in the street. It wouldn't be everyday. And when Carrie asked her, she always found a lame excuse. So to solve this problem he decided to install a hidden camera in Bailey car. And what he saw and heard pushed her to call the police. Follow me and find out what happened next in part two."

And now another young woman is next. This is Shaunty de decords, and with both the support of her doctors and her parents, she has gone through with ending her life. She was 16 and on a school trip when she survived the Brussels Airport bombing. After that, she quote, was never the same. Now, according to Shanti's parents, she found it impossible to enjoy life after the attack, to the point where she was scared of balloons bursting and was suffering panic attacks from fireworks. This is what reportedly LED them to support her decision, with everyone in her life telling her that her disease was incurable. Doctors then, quote, logically granted her request given her state of suffering and on May 7th, the procedure was performed. And to be specific, this is reportedly a process for your given a sedative and then a drug that stops your heart. It's actually legal in five countries across Europe. And again now this young woman is following Chante's lead. 20 eight year old Zariah Beak is from another small town in Germany and like Chante, she is struggling with her mental health. In her case, she lives with her boyfriend and her two cats, but has been dealing with depression and multiple personality disorder for years. Her doctors have also told her that they have no further treatment options, to which she has said, quote, I have always Been clear that if I can't get better, I won't do this anymore. She's reportedly scheduled to be euthanized next month on the couch of she and her boyfriend's home. Now, what we know is the talk of Zari's case is leading to controversy on whether or not this should be legal. There is a review panel to determine if an applecant is eligible, and it's then reportedly their job to examine the death and declare that it was done mawfully. But one former member on that panel has said, quote, I entered the review committee in 2005, and I was there until 2,014. In those years, I saw euthanasia practice evolve from death being a last resort option to being a default option. So I resign. He went on to say that this is especially prevalent in young adults with psychological issues and that doctors are now more easily giving up on their patients. In 2 thousand twenty three, they were hundreds euthanized in Germany, with one of them being shaunty. And while one neurologist did make complaints about the decision being made prematurely, the case was then closed after it was found that no violations were made. And as for Zariah, she's already gotten off of social media ahead of her procedure. She says that things will go something like this. Quote, the doctor really takes her time. It's not that they walk in and say, lay down, please. Most of the time it's first a cup of Coffee to settle the nerves and create a soft atmosphere. Then she asked if I'm ready. I will take my place in the couch. She will once again ask if I am sure, and she will start up the procedure and wish me a good journey. Or in my case, a nice nap. Because I hated people say safe journey. I'm not going anywhere."

Special needs teacher Anderson, 37, clutched Pixie, the cute little Shitzu pup that he and Blanchard, 32, adopted together in January as he told Dailymail Com that he was for sure keeping the dog. Barely four months ago, Anderson posted about his perfect life on Instagram when he introduced Pixie to followers in a picture of her with Blanchard and wrote my two favorite girls, my family is adorable. I'm so lucky. Instead, just a day ago on Thursday, pictures emerged of Blanchard hand in hand with Urker, who first started writing to her in 2018 after seeing her HBO documentary Mommy Dead and dearest. They broke up not long before she started the prison romance with Anderson. In 2020, apparently without a care in the world, a beaming Blanchard and Erker were seen visiting a Dollar General store in South Louisiana and casually smoking a cigarette together. They made no effort to hide the matching husky dog tattoos they just got days earlier. For Anderson, it was a cruel and confusing display of their closeness. He told Dailymail Com, I haven't spoken to her, so I just don't know what's going on. I'm at a loss. I'm really not doing well at all."

They then began stomping on that poor man's head and then pulled his pants down and took his belt off and started beating him with it. The girls are then seen cheering and laughing and one of them even says he's leaking, referring to him bleeding. So how did this all start? While investigators did some digging and they found security footage right before this incident where a man who appeared to be in his 20s was grabbing brown by the collar and throwing him against a wall. That's when the girls walk by, saw this happening and asked can I fight him instead? And that's when the man replied yes. This was horrific and senseless and done for their own sick pleasure. Three of the girls were arrested and charged with second degree murder after two of them said that they didn't wanna fight brown, but the men threatened to shoot them if they didn't.

The Daily Mail put out this article Gypsy Rose Blanchard's estranged husband Ryan Anderson reveals he was blindsided by their split and had no clue she still had strong feelings for her ex boyfriend. Speaking exclusively to dailymail.com, Ryan Anderson confirms that he and Gypsy have separated over her continued relationship with her ex fiance Ken. He said, I'm not doing well with it. For me it just came out of the blue. I had no idea she still had such strong feelings for him. Special needs teacher Anderson, 37, clutched Pixie, the cute little Shih Tzu pup that he and Blanchard, 32, adopted together, in January, as he told dailymail.com that he was for sure keeping the dog. Barely four months ago, Anderson posted about his perfect life on Instagram when he introduced Pixie to followers in a picture of her with Blanchard and wrote my two favorite girls, my family is adorable. I'm so lucky. Instead, just a day ago on Thursday, pictures emerged of Blanchard hand in hand with Urker, who first started writing to her in 2018 after seeing her HBO documentary Mommy Dead and dearest. They broke up not long before she started the prison romance with Anderson. In 2020, apparently without a care in the world, a beaming Blanchard and Erker were seen visiting a Dollar General store in south Louisiana and casually smoking a cigarette together. They made no effort to hide the matching husky dog tattoos they just got days earlier. For Anderson, it was a cruel and confusing display of their closeness. He told dailymail.com, I haven't spoken to her, so I just don't know what's going on. I'm at a loss. I'm really not doing well at all."

Oh yeah, did I mention he's a free man walking out in society right now? Let's talk about this. This is Aaron Hutton from New Zealand. In the year 2,014, New Zealand police started tracking an account that went by Kiwi Pedo on the dark web, and the chats that this user was having with undercover police were disturbing. Aaron had responded to an ad that an undercover officer posted offering a Chinese child for sale for $10,000. Aaron reached out and it seemed like he was deadly serious. During his conversations with the undercover officer. Aaron reference Joseph Fritzel, the man who imprisoned his own daughter for 24 years in Austria, repeatedly assaulted her, and even had children with her. Aaron referred to Joseph as his hero. And when the undercover officer asked Aaron if having a random Chinese child in his home would raise any suspicion, Aaron, chatting as Kiwi Pedo, responded, it's called a basement. So eventually Aaron started telling the undercover officer that he would pay up to $15,000 in cash or bitcoin for a child under seven. And soon afterwards, the authorities were able to pinpoint where his chats were coming from, his workplace, and Aaron was then arrested and his workplace and house were searched. Now, investigators actually found 417 CP or CSAM images and videos on Aaron's devices, which in my opinion is enough to be A life sentence. But after all was said and done, after this man tried to purchase a child under seven years old on the dark web, after he was found to be in possession of hundreds of CP and CSAM images and videos, he was sentenced to five years in prison. And to add insult to injury, his five year sentence was thrown out and he was re sentenced to only three years in prison. This happened a few years ago. So that means that he's back out in society right now? Yes, Aaron has already been released. He's already served his full sentence for all of that. And it truly just makes me sick to my stomach that people like this keep getting away with these crimes time and time again. When you're in possession of hundreds of CP or CSAM images, that should be treated as you victimizing hundreds of children. But the government doesn't see it that way for some reason. I don't understand why. And yeah, he's back out. If you wanna hear more true crime stories, be sure to listen to my wife and I podcast, murder in America, available on all streaming platforms."

So I'm gonna preface this by saying that this did not come directly from Seth, but it did come from somebody very close to this investigation. It's also somebody who's given me a lot of information on a couple cases, and it is always been accurate. So, as a lot of y'all know, the Bauer Sox, who are Christopher Crawford's parents, took a trip to Alaska a couple days after Sebastian went missing. Well, I have it on very good authority, and I'm awaiting to get more detail so I can show y'all pictures and stuff like that. Um, that once they got to what we believe is Seattle, somewhere in the Washington area, they got on a plane to fly to Alaska. And from what I've been told, it was not a commercial jet. Fact, it was a private jet. And apparently, somebody in the family either works an aviation or owns a jet or has access to jet. Something wrong that I'm trying to get the confirmation on that. Um, but that means you're not going through the standard airport that everybody else is going through. On top of that, by not driving through Canada, it means that you don't have to show passport. Now, I'm not accusing anybody of anything. I'm Just saying that it's very interesting information, and once I have more of it, pictures, additional confirmation, I'll make sure to be back on and let you guys know. But the reason that I'm sharing it now is because, like I said earlier, the person who I got it from has never given me incorrect information."

Brianna's doorbell camera catches her leaving the house on February 11th, 2023 around twelve forty five PM. As she walks and opens the gate to the sidewalk, she sends a message to her mom, dogs are locked up, gonna go meet a friend. You can tell by the CCTV footage that Brianna's a little bit nervous. She's texting on her pink cell phone and she's giving a rundown of the whole day to her best friend, Amelia. Brianna is very anxious. She's never rode the bus alone, so she's quickly sitting down in the seat closest to the bus driver, closest to the front doors, like the safest seat. And she puts her little bag on her lap and she texts Amelia, her comfort person. And she's joking to Amelia that the bus is driving so wonky, like side to side, it's gonna tip over before she even makes it to her destination. She's feeling really anxious about this.

On Tuesday, Donald Trump gave speeches in both Green Bay, Wisconsin and Grand Rapids, Michigan. And during his speech in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Donald Trump tried to exploit the death. Exploit the murder of a young woman, 25 years old, named Ruby Garcia, who was murdered by someone named Brendan Ortiz V. Day, who Garcia had a relationship with. Unclear if it was a boyfriend girlfriend relationship. Ruby Garcia sister, Mavi Garcia, says that it was more of acquaintances is how she would describe it. But during the speech, Donald Trump lied. What else is new? But he claimed he spoke to the family of Ruby Garcia, which was completely and entirely false. And now Mavi Garcia, Ruby Garcia's sister, is speaking out and saying that Donald Trump is trying to exploit their family, exploit the murder as a way to launch xenophobic attacks on the immigrant community. But she says that Donald Trump trying to scapegoat all immigrants and not address the fact that crimes can be committed by all Americans, not just immigrants, is something that she thinks is just utterly despicable. That she's trying to use the murder of his sister and lie about having a meeting with her. With her sister, which did not take place at all. Let me show you the portion of Donald Trump speech where he starts talking about the murder of Ruby Garcia. This is how he brings it up. Let's play this clip. Now. Ruby's loved Ones and community are left grieving for this incredible young woman. Remembering what they called her, they said she had just as most contagious laughter, and when she walked into a room, she lit up that room. And I've heard that from so many people. I spoke to some of her family."

One of the things that came from this report was that Travis Runner allegedly moved his son Talon to the family's 850 thousand dollar cabin in Sholo, which is three hours away from his home after Preston's death. Ex girlfriend claimed to have messaged Talon Runner on Snapchat while he hid at the cabin. He allegedly shared a photo of him walking the family dog Gucci, and she claims that in that photo his jaw was swollen. Also claimed that the Renner family attorney had allegedly advised them to Let Talon's hands heal before coming back to his hometown of Gilbert, allegedly told police that Renner holds in a lot of aggression and when he snaps, he snaps. Additionally, Ashley Reynolds, a former employee of Travis Runner at Relentless Media Agency, told The Arizona Republic last month that Travis and the company CEO, Adam Kifer allegedly discussed moving Talon to the cabin and shifting the blame on another boy involved in the deadly assault. She claimed that the two men asked her to help with the unquote crisis and regularly provided updates to her about the case, and she remained unwilling to help for two months, after which she was fired.

A Nickelodeon spokesperson told CBS News in a statement that it can't corroborate or negate allegations from productions decades ago and in the interview, Schneider said he is embarrassed and regrets his behavior, adding he owes people a pretty strong apology. He also addressed some of the other allegations highlighted in the docu series, including sexually suggestive jokes that he included in some of the shows, saying he's in favor of cutting them out now if they're upsetting to viewers. Two female writers on The Amanda Show alleged they had to split a salary in order to get hired, something Scheider said He had no control over.

The hall was closed in November of 2,023 due to high levels of PCBs, which are carcinogens. Levels were about 38 times higher than the recommended EPA levels. This is Sarah Glad and she was a student at NC State and she spent significant time at PO Hall. Unfortunately, she was diagnosed with stage four breast cancer and died at the age of 35.

But Gypsy does want this relationship with her family since she didn't really have that when she was still living with her mother, Didi. As you guys know, Gypsy announced last week that she is now separated from Ryan, and she's currently living with her father in Louisiana. Well, guess who showed up in Louisiana. We are being told that her ex fiance, Ken, has been on a whirlwind trip with Gypsy in Louisiana. Anna. They visited a tattoo shop where they got matching tattoos. They even went to New Orleans where they walked around the French Quarter and stopped in a restaurant. I'm being told that Gypsy and Ken are not back together. They're not romantic, and Ken is just there to support her while she goes through this public breakup. However, they were once engaged. They did have romantic feelings at one point. Do you guys think they're gonna get back together? Let us know in the comments below."

So I spoken to people in Gypsy's world to tell me that ever since Gypsy got released from prison back in December, her and her husband Ryan have been arguing non stop.

This is 29 year old William Mcclish will now spend his life behind bars for assaulting these two officers back in 2021 with the attempt to surprise and kill them. And of course, this happened in Orlando, Florida. He was convicted yesterday, April 3rd, for a number of things. Attempted for degree murder, aggravated assault, battery on an officer, resisting an officer with violence. Just keeps adding up. And on top of that, he was streaming this on Facebook. This happened in September of 2021. He propped his phone up in the trash can and started streaming on North Magnolia and East Washington Street. As soon as the streaming happened, the two officers were in frame. Mcclish decided to slap one of them on the head with a brick. And of course, as the title suggests, he bit one of them and gouged one of the eyes. He also snatched one of the officers radios off of his uniform to prevent him from calling for help. Now, he represented himself during the trial and all he said was, I didn't do it. The evidence was tampered with. However, obviously he streamed this whole thing live, so it wasn't. Kind of incriminated himself with that. Let me know what you guys think about this in the comment section below. And as always, these videos are for informational purposes only."

I know interest rates are high, but damn. This is 46 year old Rosie Chavez and she killed a 36 year old car salesman by shooting him in February. She fatally shot Christophero Rosario Gonzalez on February 10th, and his body was found on February 13th. Upon investigation, they realize this car salesman was kidnapped during a test drive and subsequently shot. Police arrested Rosie Chavez after learning this about a month later on March 22nd. She faces charges for first degree murder and obviously kidnapping. She scheduled to appear in court on April 10th, so that's about a week away. But holy crap. I wonder if these two know each other. I tried to find articles regarding that, but I really couldn't find anything. Maybe it's just random. People are so crazy today. Maybe they weren't giving the prices she wanted. If you guys are from Illinois around Chicago, have you guys heard about the story? I've seen a lot of headlines. This one surprised me. I've always thought things like this could happen, but I never thought it would actually happen. Let me know what you guys think about the story in the comment section below.

Chris also mentioned that there is still an investigation on going into Riley's death and that there are some people that they need talk to, meaning the police, that even at this point, they still have not reached out to, still have not made contact with. On top of that, Riley's family has really struggled, uh, to accept the fact that he might have drowned, because apparently, he was also an excellent swimmer. And then you coupled that with the fact that they didn't find water in his lungs, it really just makes it a little bit more, uh, interesting. Regarding Sebastian Rogers, it's come out that the glasses that were found during a recent search for him, uh, were not Sebastian's glasses. On top of that, an additional search has been organized for today, and today is Wednesday, April 3rd, um, in an area that they have already searched. They basically said that they don't expect it to Be fruitful. Uh, but they don't wanna leave any stone unturned. But it seems to be a pretty massive search effort for them to just be saying that."

And that tattoo shop is very close to where her father lives. And there's this picture that has been circulating around online where you see Ryan and Gypsy sitting next to him while he is getting his tattoo. Sources say that they were at the shop around 3 p m. With a clear idea in mind for what they wanted. Hutching husky tattoos to symbolize their strong bond. Sources also say that one of them got a husky tattoo on the right and the other one got on the left. That way, when they put their arms together, the Huskies are facing one another. And here's a photo of Gypsy and Ken in 2,019. And this is when they were fiances. And while I witnesses say it definitely appears that Gypsy and Ken are together. Ken's mother spoke with people magazine, and she said that they were just friendly, that he is just supporting her during her separation from Ryan Anderson. Obviously, there's a notable history between Gypsy and Ken. Ken had reached out to Gypsy while she was in prison after he Saw her HBO documentary, their connection deepened. And in October of 2,018, he popped the question. I don't know what happened between Ken and Gypsy, because obviously, when she left prison, she was married to Ryan Anderson. But it seems like Gypsy Rose has a shoulder to lean on during her separation from her husband."

And there's this picture that has been circulating around online where you see Ryan and Gypsy sitting next to him while he is getting his tattoo. Sources say that they were at the shop around 3 p m. With a clear idea in mind for what they wanted. Hutching husky tattoos to symbolize their strong bond. Sources also say that one of them got a husky tattoo on the right and the other one got on the left. That way, when they put their arms together, the Huskies are facing one another. And here's a photo of Gypsy and Ken in 2,019. And this is when they were fiances. And while I witnesses say it definitely appears that Gypsy and Ken are together. Ken's mother spoke with people magazine, and she said that they were just friendly, that he is just supporting her during her separation from Ryan Anderson. Obviously, there's a notable history between Gypsy and Ken. Ken had reached out to Gypsy while she was in prison after he Saw her HBO documentary, their connection deepened. And in October of 2,018, he popped the question. I don't know what happened between Ken and Gypsy, because obviously, when she left prison, she was married to Ryan Anderson. But it seems like Gypsy Rose has a shoulder to lean on during her separation from her husband."

They just had a press conference and there were some really key nuggets that we pulled from it that I'm gonna share with you guys right now. First, let's talk about Sebastian's parents and stepdad at this point in time. The police said that there was no indication of foul play at this point and that none of the parents are suspects. And the fact that they have all been extremely cooperative. They've done everything that the police have asked them to do. The next thing I wanna address something that's been going around on social media, which is that they found a pair of Sebastian's glass or glasses that look like Sebastian's. And that's quasi true. They did find a pair of glasses. They have not said whether or not they are related to Sebastian or if they were his. Um, I'm guessing there will be more testing involved. They're probably looking at that. And so soon as we have more information on that, of course I'll come on and update you. They also talked about updates regarding the United occasion Navy. They said specifically that they were really appreciative of the occasion Navy coming out and handing out flyers. Um, they also said that they were not working directly with law enforcement, that they were working independently, um, of law enforcement, not directly with them. And to Their knowledge that nobody from the United Asian Navy received any death threats. If they did, um, they were not made known about it. Lastly, I think this is most important. If you have any tips regarding Sebastian Rogers, anybody that's talked to him, anybody that's seen anything, knows anything, see something, say something, call the TBI. They are still definitely wanting to talk to people. And lastly, later this week, I'm supposed to be talking with Seth Rogers, so definitely make sure that follow button if you want to, cause I will give you all updates as to when that's gonna happen as soon as we get that scheduled."

They just had a press conference and there were some really key nuggets that we pulled from it that I'm gonna share with you guys right now. First, let's talk about Sebastian's parents and stepdad at this point in time. The police said that there was no indication of foul play at this point and that none of the parents are suspects. And the fact that they have all been extremely cooperative. They've done everything that the police have asked them to do. The next thing I wanna address something that's been going around on social media, which is that they found a pair of Sebastian's glass or glasses that look like Sebastian's. And that's quasi true. They did find a pair of glasses. They have not said whether or not they are related to Sebastian or if they were his. Um, I'm guessing there will be more testing involved. They're probably looking at that. And so soon as we have more information on that, of course I'll come on and update you. They also talked about updates regarding the United occasion Navy. They said specifically that they were really appreciative of the occasion Navy coming out and handing out flyers. Um, they also said that they were not working directly with law enforcement, that they were working independently, um, of law enforcement, not directly with them. And to Their knowledge that nobody from the United Asian Navy received any death threats. If they did, um, they were not made known about it. Lastly, I think this is most important. If you have any tips regarding Sebastian Rogers, anybody that's talked to him, anybody that's seen anything, knows anything, see something, say something, call the TBI.

The humanitarian aid workers from World Central Kitchen went in a convoy of three car. Remember, this trip to the warehouse to drop off aid was coordinated with the IDF. Usually they go in one vehicle. This time they needed three vehicles, so it had extra aid worker. And based off of the information that IDRA saw that was released, they attacked them over the distance of a mile and a half, or 2.43 kilometers. And it was basically a freaking mouse chase. Where they struck the first car, whoever survived the first strike ran all of this distance to the second Mark, then they were struck there, ran whoever survived to the third Mark. And that's where a direct drone strike happened. They struck them three different times over the distance of a mile and a half. These humanitarian aid workers were chased down. Literally. They had to run for their lives from car to car to try and avoid being unalived. Where in God's green earth is this an accident? They were hunted."

This comes just days after Gypsy Rose announces that she and her now husband Ryan Anderson have split. So this is the picture that's circulating. This is Gypsy and her ex Ken at the tattoo parlor. And TMZ is reporting that they each got a husky tattoo. The same husky tattoo, but one got it on their right arm, one got it on their left arm. And when they put their arms together, the huskies allegedly look at each other. So people magazines got the confirmation. So they have done an interview with Ken's mother, Raina Williams, and she confirmed that the two of them did go out to lunch and then went to a tattoo parlor. The tattoo parlor was owned by Gypsy's cousin, whose name is Bobby Petrie, and they confirmed as well that the pair did get matching tattoos. Ken's mother did clarify that they are not back together and she said they're very cool. Ken is just being a supportive friend to her and that is it. She said that she thinks Gypsy is a sweet girl, that she's made her mistakes and she just wishes the best for her. Ken's mother also shared how we ended up meeting Gypsy. She said that she and her son watched mummy dead and dearest. Of course it's all about Gypsy Rose and they watch it around the same time. Ken Shared with her that he wanted to write Gypsy a letter and just say that he sympathized with her and she thought it was a great idea. So that's how Ken and Gypsy ended up meeting and eventually getting engaged. She said as of right now, there is no plans on a romantic scale for the two, but she said, my son has never had any kind of ill intentions towards Gypsy. It devastated him when they broke up the first time, but he truly thought that that was what was best for Gypsy. In the lifetime docuseries The Prison Confessions of Gypsy Rose Blanchard, Gypsy admits to still being in contact with Ken just weeks before she marries Ryan Anderson, and she also admitted to still having feelings for him. TMZ also claims to have interviewed Ken's mother, and she claims that Ken had flown all the way from Texas, where his home is, to Louisiana to be with Gypsy Rose and to be a rock for her during her separation from her ex, now Ryan Anderson. Ken's mom allegedly shared with TMZ that she feels that her son's motivations are pure when it comes to Gypsy Rose Blanchard, but she also stated that Ryan's weren't. She said he was untrustworthy and simply doesn't care for her the way that Ken does. In any case, the bottom line is apparently the two are still friends, Ken does still care for her, and now they have matching tattoos to prove It"

Braden's mother arrived at that daycare at one o four PM. EMS was already there on scene trying to perform life saving measures. Shortly after, their pediatrician arrived and took over those life saving measures. Braden was then transported to the emergency room where they continued CPR on Braden for several hours before he was pronounced deceased. On Friday, the employee over the infant room there at Tender Ears Daycare, 68 year old Versa May Simmons, was arrested and she was charged with the murder of five month old Braden Robertson. Versa was given a One million dollar bond. It is reported to me by multiple sources, multiple families who have children inside that daycare that there are cameras inside that daycare. And this murder charges came after the video footage inside that infant room was reviewed."

They just had a press conference and there were some really key nuggets that we pulled from it that I'm gonna share with you guys right now. First, let's talk about Sebastian's parents and stepdad at this point in time. The police said that there was no indication of foul play at this point and that none of the parents are suspects. And the fact that they have all been extremely cooperative. They've done everything that the police have asked them to do. I wanna address something that's been going around on social media, which is that they found a pair of Sebastian's glasses or glasses that look like Sebastian's. And that's quasi true. They did find a pair of glasses. They have not said whether or not they are related to Sebastian or if they were his. Um, I'm guessing there will be more testing involved. They're probably looking at that. And so soon as we have more information on that, of course I'll come on and update you. They also talked about updates regarding the United Cajun Navy. They said specifically that they were really appreciative of the occasion. Navy coming out and handing out flyers. Um, they also said that they were not working directly with law enforcement, that they were working independently, um, of law enforcement, not directly with them. And to Their knowledge that nobody from the United occasion Navy received any death threats. If they did, um, they were not made known about it. Lastly, I think this is most important. If you have any tips regarding Sebastian Rogers, anybody that's talked to him, anybody that's seen anything, knows anything, see something, say something, call the TBI. They are still definitely wanting to talk to people. And lastly, later this week, I'm supposed to be talking with Seth Rogers, so definitely make sure to hit that follow button if you want to, cause I will give you all updates as to when that's gonna happen as soon as we get that scheduled."

Dan Scavino made not only $240,000, but has given, has been given a promissary note in the principal amount of 2.2 million dollars and a retention bonus in the amount of $600,000. And scavinos on Trump's campaign, he was Trump's deputy chief of staff. And so you have someone who's working for Trump's campaign now making this type of money as well. And then you've got Trump's Own independent auditor, BF Borgers. And again he had brought BF Borgers. I never heard of BF. Have you heard of BF Borgers? I didn't. That's why I wanted to look. Who the heck is BF Borgers"

Their goal with this experiment was to strengthen the Russian military by testing if humans could stay awake for 30 days. So they gathered five prisoners of war, who were deemed enemies of the state, to be the test subjects for this experiment. Experimenters sealed the subjects in a chamber where they were going to pump in a stimulant gas to keep them awake for 30 days. First, about five days, nothing really happened, although the experimenters did notice that the conversations among the participants were getting deeper and darker as time went on. But then after more than 120 hours awake, everything changed. The participant stop talking to each other and kept whispering into the microphones that were set up so the researchers could hear them. One participant then started screaming non stop, eventually tearing his vocal cords. While this happened, others just completely ignored him and continue to whisper into the microphones. After a few more days, other participants tore apart the books that had been left for them and smeared them with their feces, creating a paste to block out the one way mirrors so the researchers could no longer see. In little while they can only hear the subjects, but then they stop talking and for several days the researchers couldn't hear or see anything coming from inside the chamber. However, they had monitors that track the oxygen Intake in the room, and they could tell that all five participants were still alive. They left the chamber sealed and just kept going with the experiment. Eventually, though, the experimenters knew that they had to do something. They told the participants that they were going to go inside to check the microphones, and that if they complied, one of them would be freed. Finally, the participants responded, saying only we do not want to be freed. After another day, the decision was made to finally enter the chamber, and when the experimenters did, what they found was a horrific scene. Only four of the participants were still alive, but every single one of them had chunks taken out of their flesh. And the way that the wounds were, they could tell that they were all self inflicted.

One participant then started screaming non stop, eventually tearing his vocal cords. While this happened, others just completely ignored him and continued to whisper into the microphones.

Their goal with this experiment was to strengthen the Russian military by testing if humans could stay awake for 38 days. So they gathered five prisoners of war, who were deemed enemies of the state, to be the test subjects for this experiment. Experimenters sealed the subjects in a chamber where they were going to pump in a stimulant gas to keep them awake for 30 days. For the first about five days, nothing really happened, although the experimenters did notice that the conversations among the participants were getting deeper and darker as time went on. But then after more than 120 hours awake, everything changed. The participants stopped talking to each other and kept whispering into the microphones that were set up so the researchers could hear them. One participant then started screaming non stop, eventually tearing his vocal cords. While this happened, others just completely ignored him and continued to whisper into the microphones. After a few more days, other participants tore apart the books that had been left for them and smeared them with their feces, creating a pace to block out the one way mirrors so the researchers could no longer see. In little while they could only hear the subjects. But then they stopped talking and for several days the researchers couldn't hear or see anything coming from inside the chamber. However, they had monitors that tracked The oxygen intake in the room, and they could tell that all five participants were still alive. they left the chamber sealed and just kept going with the experiment. Eventually, though, the experimenter is knew that they had to do something. They told the participants that they were going to go inside to check the microphones, and that if they complied, one of them would be freed. Finally, the participants responded saying only, we do not want to be freed. After another day, the decision was made to finally enter the chamber. And when the experimenters did, what they found was a horrific scene. Only four of the participants were still alive, but every single one of them had chunks taken out of their flesh. And the way that the wounds were, they could tell that they were all self inflicted. Their internal organs were exposed, and they were all in really bad shape. But despite finally being able to be freed, they protested and just said, we want the gas turned back on. We. The experimenters were able to restrain them and bring them to a medical center for treatment. When they finally got them out of the chamber, they were shocked at the state that the participants were in. And then it got even scarier when they started to perform surgeries in. The participants kept protesting against being put under four the surgeries on participant even dying once he was finally put to sleep. After that death, The medical team performed though of remaining three surgeries while the participants were awake. And they just sat there laughing and smiling while it was happening. Also surgeries were complete. The participants just continued to beg to go back in the chamber with the gas on. So the experimenters agreed go to part two."

At the time, they were living with Jennifer's boyfriend, Joey Benton. Fast forward to March 23rd 2,004. Jennifer knows that Adriana is having trouble going to bathroom and that she's sick. She decides to take her to the ER where they discover that she has an infection, an infection that's typically found in adults who are sexually active and it's not always caused by that. Then on March 25th, 2004, that was the last time anyone in Jennifer's family heard from her when she made a 30 minute phone call to her father and basically said that she was scared of Joey's mom. From there, any version or timeline of events has come from Joey and according to Joey, he got home early from work that day to find Jennifer locked in their bedroom. They decide to go out for a drive where they ultimately argued and broke up. Joey then took them back to his parents house where Jennifer refused to go in and demanded to be taken to a gas station. Instead he decided to take her to a grocery store where she made a phone call and then to the gas station where he claims that she got into a four door Camaro or Mustang, neither of which exist now. For the first time in 20 years they have served a search warrant on Joey Benton. There is also a new detective on the case."

Then on March 25th, 2004, that was the last time anyone in Jennifer's family heard from her when she made a 30 minute phone call to her father and basically said that she was scared of Joey's mom. From there, any version or timeline of events has come from Joey and according to Joey, he got home early from work that day to find Jennifer locked in their bedroom. They decide to go out for a drive where they ultimately argued and broke up. Joey then took them back to his parents house where Jennifer refused to go in and demanded to be taken to a gas station. Instead he decided to take her to a grocery store where she made a phone call and then to the gas station where he claims that she got into a four door Camaro or Mustang, neither of which exist now. For the first time in 20 years they have served a search warrant on Joey Benton. There is also a new detective on the case."
